    "The Fraxiniidae are a family of moths in the superfamily Geometroidea, containing about 1,000 species worldwide and distributed across all continents except Antarctica (see map). They have been placed within the parent taxon Geometridae since their original description by Linnaeus in 1761 as Geometra fraxinella; however they were subsequently moved to their own family due to differences between them and other geometrid genera such as Apate or Epirrhoe.\nFraxiniids can be distinguished from most other geometrids by having two pairs of spurs on each hind tibia rather than one pair found elsewhere among geometrids. The larvae feed primarily upon plants belonging to the genus Fraxinus but also include some that eat Ulmus trees.",

These spores may be dispersed by wind currents over long distances from parent tree infections.   Infected trees often show no symptoms until they become stressed due to drought conditions or other environmental factors.    Symptoms include wilting leaves followed by death of branches and/or entire trunks.

    "The following is the full text of Francis Edward Limmer's obituary, as published in The Times on 16 May 1943.\nFrancis Edward Limmer FRIBA (1873–1943) was born at Stoke Newington and died suddenly after a short illness at his home near Hampstead Heath last week aged sixty-nine years.  He had been one of our leading architects since he began practice in London about twenty-five years ago; but it has always seemed to me that what made him stand out from other men who have practised architecture during this period were two qualities which are not often found together — originality combined with restraint.   His buildings show great imagination without extravagance or pretentiousness; they combine beauty of form with simplicity of detail; yet there is never any attempt at display or bravura effects; everything seems perfectly natural because every part serves its purpose well.    In recent years Mr Limmer’s work included many important schools such as those at Walthamstow, Harrow-on-the-Hill, Cheltenham Ladies’ College, and Merchant Taylors' School for Girls, Northwood Hills Road, all of them distinguished by their fine proportions and dignified character.     It may be said too that although Mr Limmer did much excellent work outside London, none of these works attracted so wide attention as some of his earlier designs like the new school building at Tonbridge Grammar School where he showed how beautifully simple forms can express themselves when used with tasteful decoration.      But perhaps I should say more than anything else that Mr Limmer will be remembered most highly for having done something towards restoring architectural standards among us.  For while we cannot deny that modern methods of construction make possible wonderful results both in design and execution, still it must be admitted that sometimes the desire to achieve novelty leads people into strange excesses.  And here again Mr Limmer set a good example by showing that if you want your buildings to look attractive...",

    "The Colimaaite is the only known meteorite to have originated from Comet Encke, which orbits between Jupiter and Mars in our solar system.\nIt was discovered on September 16, 1950 by Luis Walter Alvarez (1914–1988) at his home near Santa Clara del Cobre, Chihuahua, Mexico while he was looking through some of his father's old mining equipment that had been left behind after his father died.  The name comes from the Mexican state where it fell; colima means \"colima\" or \"colline\" in Spanish.   It has also sometimes been called the \"Chihuahua Meteorite\" because its fall site lies within Chihuahuan Desert territory.    This cometary origin makes this one of very few meteorites whose parent body can be identified as being part of the Solar System's dust cloud.   In addition to having come directly from Comet Encke itself, the Colimaaite contains many minerals found nowhere else but in comets such as carbonates like calcite.     Because of these unique characteristics, scientists are able to use the Colimaaite to study how water may have formed on Earth during Earth's formation 4 billion years ago when Comet Encke collided with the planet.      Scientists believe that if there were any life forms living on Earth back then they would likely not survive the impact caused by the collision of Comet Encke with Earth.       However, even though no evidence exists today proving that life existed before the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago,  scientists do know that liquid water flowed freely across much of the surface of the Earth until about 3.5 billion years ago so it's possible that other collisions occurred earlier than we think.       ...",

    "The Lorraine 37L was the last of four prototypes built by Lorraine-Dietrich in 1937, and is now preserved at the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace (Paris).

This would be known as the Lorraine 452 or simply the Lorraine-Dietrich LD-452.   However, before work could begin on this project, it became apparent that there were major problems associated with the original Léo 451 concept which meant that any further development effort might well prove fruitless.    As such, Lorraine-Dietrich decided instead to build another single-seat fighter aircraft using some of the features incorporated into the earlier designs but incorporating several significant improvements over those concepts including a more powerful engine, better armament protection against ground fire, improved aerodynamics and greater range.  \nThis resulted in what has become known as the Lorraine-37L.   It first flew on 15 May 1938 under test pilot René Mouchotte who later went on to fly many other types produced by Lorraine-Dietrich during his career.   After completing initial flight testing, the aircraft underwent static tests followed by high-speed taxiing trials where it demonstrated excellent handling qualities despite being powered by only one wing-mounted engine.   In addition, these early flights also revealed that the aircraft possessed good climb performance and very high speed capabilities making it highly manoeuvrable even when flying close to stall speeds.    ...",

It is only one year since they lost out narrowly against Tyrone but it seems that their confidence has been restored as they have now won four straight minor titles.   The final score line reflects how close both sides are matched up front where there will be no shortage of talent over the next few years.

On paper, Kilkenny's best chance lay in beating Cork once again in the semi-final but unfortunately for them, things did not quite work out like that.  \n\nKilkenny started off well enough when Pat Ryan opened the scoring early in the second half before Kevin McCarthy replied for Cork just three minutes later.  However, despite having the better chances throughout the remainder of the match,  Kilkenny could never get back into contention and eventually fell short by six points. \n\nIn the other semi final, Ulster defeated Leinster 2-17 to 3-10 while Connacht beat Munster 5-18 to 4-12 in what turned out to be another classic encounter between these counties.\n\nUlster made light work of Leinster thanks largely to goalscorer Jim McGarry whose tally of 1-5 helped his side secure victory without too much difficulty.

    "Skateboards are used by skaters to glide across surfaces, such as pavements and skate parks.\nThe board is usually made of wood or fiberglass covered in grip tape on the underside (called the \"concave\") which allows it to be gripped tightly when riding downhill at high speeds.  The deck can also have concave grooves cut into its surface that allow water drainage during rainy weather.   Skateboard trucks are attached directly onto the bottom side of each end of the board; these provide support while turning.    Wheels are mounted between the truck axles so they roll along the ground beneath them.   Trucks may either be fixed or swiveling depending upon their design.

She had been ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte to be used as his personal ship during his expedition against Egypt.   The vessel's name is derived from the Latin word diligens meaning \"quickly moving or active\"; it also refers to her speedy sailing qualities.    On 9 July 1798, she left Toulon carrying troops destined for Egypt; they arrived off Alexandria on 1 August after which the crew were sent ashore while the captain remained aboard to negotiate terms with the Egyptian authorities.   After negotiations failed he returned to the boat but found that most of its crew had deserted; only one man remained who refused to leave until the rest came back.   He then sailed away leaving the captain stranded without any men to sail the ship.   This incident became known as the Aboukir disaster when the British captured the vessel later that day.   In 1799, the vessel was renamed La Diligente before being rebuilt into a larger warship called Le Héros.   During this time, the original hull lay abandoned near Alexandria where it was discovered by Lieutenant James Bruce who bought it from the Arabs.

On 24 September 1783 he arrived in Rome to receive his red hat and pallium from the pope himself before returning home via France and England.   The following year he returned again to Rome to be consecrated bishop by Pope Clement XIV.   His appointment caused some controversy because it had been expected that the new primate would come from either Armagh or Cashel rather than Limerick.   However Burke proved highly popular during his tenure as archbishop and gained great respect throughout Europe due to his scholarship and piety.   During his time as primate he also served as President of the Catholic Association founded by Edmund Burke.   He died suddenly while visiting Paris on 10 May 1818 aged 61 leaving behind two sons and four daughters including Mary Anne Burke who married General Sir Richard Coote, 1st Baronet.

    "The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is the Indian Army's Corps of Engineers responsible for building and maintaining roads, bridges, airfields etc in India's remote border areas along Pakistan, China, Nepal & Bhutan.\nHistory\n\nIn 1947 India became independent from Britain but was divided into two countries by partitioning its population on religious lines between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. \nIndia inherited British rule over most parts of what are now called Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh regions which were part of the princely states of Jammu and Kashmir respectively.  The Himalayan mountain ranges that separate these territories also divide them geographically making it difficult to maintain communications across this barrier.

    "The cathedral of the diocese of Strasbourg is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul; it was built in Gothic style between 1015 and 1439 on the site where St. Peter baptised Saint Paul (see Acts 9:33–38). The church has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988.\nHistory\n\nIn the 6th century, Bishop Eucharius founded a monastery at this location which became known by his name.  In 734, he consecrated a basilica here that had previously served as a Roman Catholic parish church.   This building survived until 1681 when Louis XIV ordered its demolition because it stood too close to the Palace of Rohan.   It was replaced by another structure designed by Jacques-François Blondel but destroyed during French Revolutionary Wars.   \nAfter Napoleon Bonaparte annexed Alsace-Lorraine from France following the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt in 1806, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc to design what would become one of Europe's most famous gothic churches.   He began work in 1864 after being appointed Architect General of Imperial Monuments under Minister of Public Instruction Victor Duruy.   His original designs were modified several times before construction finally started in 1872.   Work continued intermittently over the next 50 years due to financial difficulties caused by both world wars.   On 15 August 1914, German troops occupied Strasbourg and stopped all further work except emergency repairs.   After the war ended, reconstruction resumed slowly and was completed only in 1965.   During the Second Vatican Council held there in 1962-63, Pope John XXIII celebrated Mass in front of the altar facing east towards Rome rather than west toward Jerusalem.

    "The Pythagoras method is one way to memorize the multiplication table, and it can be used in other ways as well.\nIt consists of:  The first step is to write down all numbers from 1 up to 12 on separate pieces of paper (or cards). Then you have to arrange them into groups according to their squares.  For example, 2 x 4 = 8 so group together 2 & 4; 3 x 9 = 27; 6 x 36 = 216 etc..  You will end up with:   Group 1: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100.   Group 2: 2,8,27,64,125,216,343,512,729.    Now that you've grouped your numbers by square value it's time to learn how they are related to each other within those groups.  \nGroup 1:    1 + 4 = 5,    4 + 16 = 20,   25 - 49 = -16,  81 + 64 = 145,   100 - 64 = 36,   64 + 81 = 155,   160 - 125 = 45,   144 + 216 = 361,   343 - 162 = 181,   512 - 216 = 295,   729 - 256 = 483  \nGroup 2:    2 + 8 = 10,    8 + 27 = 35,   64 + 128 = 192,   125 + 216 = 341,   216 + 343 = 509,   512 + 486 = 1023,   1024 - 819 = 191,   2048 - 1536 = 291",

    "The Plinian core is the central part of a volcanic eruption column, which consists primarily of pyroclastic material and ash that rises from the vent to form a mushroom cloud or towering plume (see Figure below ). The term \"plinian\" comes from the Latin name for Mount Vesuvius in Italy where this type of eruption was first observed by Aristotle around 300 BC.\nPlinian eruptions are characterized by high volumes of gas-rich magma being released at relatively low pressure into open space above ground level; they can be explosive but not necessarily so.  They may also occur as dome collapses when large amounts of molten rock suddenly escape through cracks within the volcano's edifice.   In either case, the resulting mixture of gases, hot particles, water vapor, and liquid droplets expands rapidly upward under its own weight until it reaches equilibrium between buoyancy forces due to density differences and gravity.    This results in rapid vertical acceleration up to terminal velocities on the order of 100 m/sec., producing extremely dense clouds of fine particulate matter known as tephra.     These clouds rise quickly toward their maximum height before spreading out horizontally over great distances, often covering areas several hundred kilometers across.   Volcanic plumes produced during these events have been recorded rising more than 30 km (19 mi) above sea-level.    As such, Plinian eruptions pose significant hazards both locally near the source region and globally via atmospheric transport processes.",
    "Brezhnev's death in 1982 was followed by the election of Konstantin Chernenko as General Secretary, who died after only five months and was succeeded by Mikhail Gorbachev.\nThe Soviet Union had been suffering from stagnating economic growth since Brezhnev's time (see stagnationism), but this reached its peak during his last years when per capita GDP fell to half that of Western Europe;[citation needed] unemployment rose dramatically while inflation soared beyond 1,000% annually.  The government responded by introducing price controls on foodstuffs which led to shortages across much of Eastern Europe.   In addition there were widespread protests against the regime throughout the USSR including strikes at Leningrad shipyards where workers demanded higher wages.   \nIn response to these problems, Gorbachev introduced glasnost' - openness – and perestroika – restructuring or reforming – policies aimed at restoring popular support within the country through greater freedom of speech and political reforms such as decentralisation of power away from Moscow towards local authorities.   He also attempted to revive the economy by abandoning central planning and allowing private enterprise under new laws known collectively as the New Economic Policy (NEP).   However he failed to reverse the decline in living standards caused by decades of mismanagement and corruption.   By 1989, the population of the USSR stood at just over 270 million people compared to more than 330 million ten years earlier.",
    "The Jagdgeschwader (\"JG\") was the Luftwaffe's fighter wing organization, and JG 28 was formed on 1 February 1937 from elements of Jasta 26 based at Werneuchen in Thuringia.

By June 1941, JG 28 had become part of Gruppe 2 of the newly created Geschwaderkommodore Reichenau's I./Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1).   In August 1943, JG 1 moved to France where they were stationed along the southern border between Germany and Luxembourg as well as south-east towards Paris.   During this time period, JG 28 became known by the nickname \"Red Devil\" due to the color scheme painted onto many of their planes during operations against Allied forces.   After being transferred back into German hands following Operation Overlord, JG 28 continued operating out of bases located around Metz before moving north-westward again toward Reims.   It is estimated that JG 28 lost about 3,000 men killed or captured throughout its existence; however, only two members survived the war.",

    "The Subulites were a group of early Christian monks who lived in the desert near Egypt during the fourth century CE, and are known primarily from their writings.\nSubulite monasteries existed as far north as Palestine (in Gaza); however, most surviving information about them comes from Egyptian sources such as Stobaeus' Anthology.  The name is derived from the Greek word \"subulos\" meaning \"hermit\"; it was also used to refer to other groups living outside cities or towns at that time.   They appear to have been influenced by earlier ascetic movements like those led by Saint Anthony the Great and Saint Macarius the Elder.    Their main goal appears to have been spiritual perfection through contemplation rather than active ministry among others.   Some scholars believe they may be related to the Coptic Orthodox Church's Order of Monks of Saint Antony which still exists today.     In his History of the Arians, Athanasius mentions one subulite named John who had converted to Arianism before becoming a hermit.      According to some historians, the Subulites played a role in spreading Christianity into North Africa after the death of Saint Augustine of Hippo.       Today there remains only one monastery belonging to this order - the Monastery of Saint Antonios in Wadi Natrun, Egypt",
