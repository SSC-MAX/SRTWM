    " The Paris Meridian (Meridian of Paris) is a line of longitude that runs through the French Capital of Paris, is the zero degree reference line for all French cartography, and is described as being at 30 minutes longitude east of Greenwich. Its origin dates back to the year 1666, when Louis XIV commissioned the astronomer Jean Picard to carry out a survey of the entire kingdom of France. During this survey, Picard chose the Observatory of Paris as the center of his measurements. The result was the establishment of the Paris Meridian, set at two degrees east of Greenwich. The Paris Meridian was used by cartographers to construct the official map of France in 1790. On the map of France, the 0 degree mark of this meridian ran from north to south, where it split the country into two equal parts. The meridian has subsequently been used to divide France into départements and as the baseline for the national grid system of metric coordinates. For the international community, the Paris Meridian was initially used as the standard of reference for longitude in 1884, when the International Meridian Conference agreed to adopt the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian for the world. Before the agreement, the location of the prime meridian was not consistently agreed upon and there were numerous suggestions of alternative prime meridians. One of these was the Paris Meridian, which was a highly suitable alternative, given that it was both known and had an easy to construct zero meridian passing through the principal city of a civilized nation. At the International Meridian Conference, William Ferrel, a meteorologist, argued in favor of Paris being used as the prime meridian, rather than Greenwich. However, Greenwich eventually won out by 26 votes, 13 to 10, over other contenders such as the Paris Meridian, Ferro Island and the Ile de France. Nevertheless, the Paris Meridian is still used as the zero degree reference line for French cartography. In Paris, there is a bronze line in the pavement which encircles the Observatory of Paris and marks the exact spot of the zero degree line of the Paris Meridian. In 2011, this spot served as one of the highlights of celebrations for the 375th anniversary of the Paris meridian, organized by the Paris Geographical Society. The Paris Meridian has been a source of much debate in the world of geography. In 1747, it was the center of a debate between Jean-Dominique Cassini and Pierre-Charles Brühl on the calculation of longitudes, which has been referred to as the \"Paris Meridian Affair\". The debate had implications for maritime navigation and the resolution of the dispute between the two men was a watershed moment in the development of geodesy and cartography. Today, the reference of the Paris Meridian has reduced in importance due to the widespread adoption of GPS for navigation and other applications. Nevertheless, it is still used in many parts of the world and its significance in French cartography and geodetic history remains.",

    " Montana (ship) was an American two-masted schooner built in 1855 at Herreshoff in Bristol, Rhode Island. She was commissioned by brother New York naturalists Alfred Chisolm and Thomas Butler to explore the northern Pacific Coast. Montana sailed from New York on June 1, 1855 and reached Oregon in September. On the return trip she stopped in Sitka, Alaska, where Chisolm invested in business ventures, then the schooner returned to the mouth of Columbia River in Oregon. In early April 1856, Montana and her crew of seven, left Oregon for the northernmost regions of The Gulf of Alaska in search of whaling grounds. On May 17, she reached Point Barrow, at latitude 71° 21' N, setting a new record for the farthest north a sailing vessel had ever traveled. After taking scientific readings and observations, the crew turned south and headed back toward Oregon. On July 14, while sailing through the Mackenzie River Delta, Montana struck an uncharted reef and sank in less than a minute. The vessel's crew was saved and they made it to the shore of Victoria Island, where they constructed shelter, built a small boat, collected stores and maintained a log of their ordeal until relief came in November. The members of the expedition were lauded for their bravery and were given a special commendation by Congress. Montana has been called \"one of the most famous of all small-boat voyages,\" and was prominently chronicled in Chisolm's book, The Cruise of the Schooner \"Montana\" from New York to the North Pacific and the Behring Sea. The Chisolm-Butler Expedition, is still a well-known early American achievement in exploration of the North Pacific Ocean. The schooner was lost at sea, but a wooden model of the Montana was built in 1995 and is now preserved in the United States Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. The model is displayed alongside a log of the crew’s travels and a display plaque. The plaque reads: “In memory of the brave men of the Montana, a vessel built in 1855, which set the record for the farthest north a sailing vessel had ever traveled, and whose crew endured the arctic cold and returned alive.”",

Scott was born in Providence, Rhode Island and raised in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. He first started singing at the Greater Nazerene Baptist Church in Harlem and, in the 1950s, he joined a gospel group called the Consolators.

Some of his biggest hits included \"Hey, Little Schoolgirl\", \"You Got What I Need\", \"I Don't Know What I'm Doing\" and \"Are You Lonely for Me Baby\".

    " In January 2021, the case of Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd, a dispute over a group of companies located in Hong Kong, came before the High Court. The case which was presided over by Justice Steward involved a claim by the Appellant, Tang Man Sit, who sought damages against the Respondent, Capacious Investments Ltd. The Appellant alleged that the Respondent had engaged in fraudulent and unfair trading practices, and that the damages amounted to over HK$20million. The Appellant was the director and shareholder of a group of companies located in Hong Kong which were incorporated in 2016. The businesses of the companies included property development, project marketing, trading of precious metal and currency, and other related activities. In August 2018, the Appellant entered into a consulting agreement with the Respondent which allowed the Respondent to have exclusive access to their information. However, the Appellant claimed that the Respondent used its access to their confidential documents for their own business gain, and not for the benefit of the Appellant. The Appellant argued that the Respondent had diverted business opportunities away from the Appellant’s companies to gain an unfair advantage. The Appellant claimed that through the use of their confidential information, the Respondent was able to secure lucrative business contracts with other parties. The Respondent, on the other hand, maintained that the consulting agreement was not the cause of the alleged losses, but that it was due to the Appellant’s lack of business acumen. The Respondent also claimed that at no time did they misuse their access to the Appellant’s confidential documents. The High Court took into consideration the arguments from both sides and examined the evidence presented. After careful review, the High Court found that the Respondent had acted in breach of trust and had abused their access to the Appellant’s confidential documents. The High Court also concluded that the Appellant had been caused to suffer loss and was entitled to a total sum of HK$20,947,800. The ruling in this case serves as an important reminder of the need for companies to comply with their compliance obligations when entering into consultancy agreements and when dealing with confidential information. It also demonstrates the need for companies to ensure they have mechanisms in place to protect themselves from fraudulent and unfair business practices.",

He founded the Pacific Aero Products Co. in 1916, which would eventually become the world-renowned Boeing Aircraft Company. His decision to start the aircraft company stemmed from his love of flying. He was a member of the starting group to fly powered flights in the Pacific Northwest in 1910. Throughout his career, Boeing's vision was to create airplanes that would revolutionize air transportation. His innovative designs resulted in a successful line of models that were significant advances on the aircraft being used at the time. He began developing his own aircraft designs in 1916, starting with the Model 1 Seaplane. He focused on building new innovative planes that were safer, more reliable and more efficient than those of his competition. This was achieved using cutting-edge and modern techniques that he had developed. Boeing and his team continued developing new models and designs for the next three decades, first with the development of the Model 15 monoplane, then the Model 40 and finally the groundbreaking Model 80. The Model 80 was Boeing’s first successful commercial aircraft and it was the first to use an all-metal fuselage. Boeing and his team also continued to make strides to develop aircraft models that could reach unprecedented speeds and heights. He and his team developed the Boeing 247D, the first twin-engine passenger airliner. This plane set speed and duration records and set the stage for modern airliner models. Boeing continued to serve as the visionary behind The Boeing Company until the mid-1950s when he retired at the age of 75. Throughout his company’s history, Boeing was able to leave an indelible mark on the history of aviation as one of its most innovative and influential figures. To this day, The Boeing Company remains one of the world’s leading aircraft developers, a legacy that William Edward Boeing left behind.",

The band is composed of vocalist/guitarist Terry Scott, bassist/vocalist Terry Smith, drummer John Hatfield and guitarist/keyboardist Marianne \"Maz\" Aylward.

The album, which was praised for its witty songwriting and aggressive yet melodic sound, established the band's reputation in the punk rock scene, with the single \"Lies That Kill\" being a UK top twenty hit. The group's second album, Burn It Down, was released in 1980, and was widely lauded by both fans and critics as a darker, grittier record than its predecessor. The band's live shows were also becoming increasingly ambitious, with seven vocalists and multiple instruments creating an intense and powerful energy.

    " Thomas O'Beirne (1944-2014) was an Irish-born Canadian politician and lawyer. He was the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre for a single term. O'Beirne was born in Dublin in 1944, and moved to Canada in 1966. He attended the University of Toronto where he studied political science and law, graduating in 1973. Following graduation he worked with the Attorney General of Ontario as well as a variety of non-profit organisations. In 1977, O'Beirne entered provincial politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of York Centre. He held this seat until 1981 when he sought election to Parliament and was elected in the riding of Toronto Centre. His win in Toronto Centre was controversial, with some alleging vote fraud. O'Beirne denied the claims and was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. O'Beirne served one term as a Member of Parliament until he was defeated in the 1984 federal election, in part due to his party's (Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives) unpopularity. Despite his defeat, O'Beirne remained active in politics and was appointed to Joe Clark's Cabinet in 1986 as the Minister for Public Works and Supply. In later life, O'Beirne moved to Vancouver and continued to practice as a lawyer. He died in 2014 at the age of 70. O'Beirne was a respected figure in politics, and a firm believer in volunteerism and public service. Following his death, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement praising O'Beirne's lifetime commitment to public service. He was also honoured by the President of Ireland, Dr. Michael D. Higgins, who stated that \"Thomas O'Beirne's dedication to the advancement of Canada in the world was exemplary\". A memorial service was held at St. Paul's Basilica in Toronto, and O'Beirne was remembered by friends, family and colleagues as a passionate, dedicated and hardworking leader. In 2015, his alma mater, the University of Toronto, honored O'Beirne posthumously by establishing the Thomas O’Beirne Women in Law and Leadership Initiative. This initiative provides leadership programming and financial support for Canadian women who wish to pursue a legal career. It is a lasting tribute to O’Beirne's passion for inclusion and promotion of diversity in Canada. Thomas O'Beirne's thought-provoking life, hard work, and commitment to public service will remain an example for generations of Canadians to come.",

    ". The 1956 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 6, 1956. Incumbent Republican United States Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen won re-election to a third term in office over Democratic challenger Paul Douglas, a former University of Chicago economics professor and United States Senator from 1949 to 1967. Securing 55.90% of the vote, Dirksen defeated Douglas by a substantial margin of 131,188 votes. Dirksen, who was first elected to the United States Senate in 1950, was a popular figure at the time of the election. While not untroubled in his bid for re-election, his large lead in the polls and strong support from incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower enabled Dirksen to prevail in the election with comparative ease. Douglas, a Democratic politician, had previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois from 1949 to 1967. He challenged Dirksen’s re-election bid in 1956, and attended a series of political forums and debates during the campaign. His effort failed, however, and he was unable to overtake the incumbent Senator’s commanding lead. In the end, Dirksen’s victory was largely attributable to strong support from President Eisenhower, who campaigned for his re-election bid in Illinois in the months leading up to the election, as well as Dirksen’s well-known popularity among the state’s voters. Dirksen’s victory would represent the fourth of his six consecutive terms in the United States Senate. The election saw moderate voter turnout, with 2,282,863 ballots counted across the state. The result of the election, seeing the re-election of Everett McKinley Dirksen, has been described as a “safe” win. It marked the final United States Senate election in the state of Illinois prior to the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which initiated direct popular elections for the chamber. Dirksen’s legacy would endure for generations and, among other things, he is remembered for his leadership in the passage of landmark legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the following years, he continued to serve his constituents in the United States Senate until his death in 1969.",

Hutton was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, and grew up in the bright lights of vaudeville. Her father (a vaudeville actor and comedian) guided her career until his death in 1940 when she was 19. After his passing, she came under the direction of fellow Battle Creek resident Charles Z.

In 1942, Hutton caught the attention of Paramount Pictures and was signed to a contract. She was cast in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944) starring Eddie Bracken and Dennis O'Keefe. It was a hit, and Hutton appeared in several other films, including Incendiary Blonde (1945), Hold That Blonde! (1945), and Cross My Heart (1946). Her star reached its zenith in 1950 with the musical comedy Annie Get Your Gun, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was a huge success, grossing more than $7 million at the box office, making it one of the highest-grossing movies of 1950. Hutton did not fare as well in the following years. Her star began to wane, and in 1953 she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Female Newcomer. Though she had a few hit movies after that, her career was in decline by the end of the 1950s. She left Hollywood for a few years and made a few guest appearances on TV shows, including The Red Skelton Show in 1960. In 1961, she attempted a comeback, but her career never fully recovered. From then on, she made appearances on stage and television, making guest appearances on variety shows and appearing in summer stock. In 1965, Hutton was cast in the Broadway version of Barefoot in the Park, opposite Robert Redford. Hutton was married four times and had one daughter. She died of natural causes on March 11, 2007, in Palm Springs, California. Though her career may have been short-lived, she made a lasting impression on the cinematic world.

Polysorbate 20 has a melting point of 56-58°C and a molecular weight of approximately 880 grams per mole. Polysorbate 20 can be used to form water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions and is often used in both food and cosmetic products. In food products, it is used to homogenize and stabilize oil-in-water emulsions or as an emulsifier in ice creams and bakery products, and as a stabilizer for syrup and salad dressing. In cosmetics, it functions as a surfactant and serves as an emollient and humectant to help form thicker, creamy and glossy textures. Because of its ability to increase the solubility of lipophilic compounds, especially those with high melting points, polysorbate 20 is widely used in pharmaceutical preparations. It is also used to solubilize oleoresins, providing better absorption. In combination with other emulsifiers, polysorbate 20 can be used to clean the skin, or to block certain drugs from being absorbed. Polysorbate 20 is one of the most widely used polysorbates because of its stability, and its ability to stabilize and disperse flavours and fragrances in cosmetics and in foods. However, polysorbates, such as polysorbate 20, can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in some people and should be used carefully when formulating products. Additionally, polysorbate 20 can hydrolyze, forming lactic and sorbic acids, which makes it unsuitable for acidic products.",

    " Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson was a 1994 decision in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida involving the contract to purchase a home and the right of a creditor to foreclose on the property. The case was decided in favor of the creditor, Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. The facts of the case: Debra and Terrance Nelson entered into a contract with a housing developer to purchase a home in Marion County, Fla. The Nelsons knew they would need a loan in order to purchase the home, so they contacted Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. for a loan. Barnett Bank agreed to provide the loan with the Nelsons as co-signers. The Nelsons took possession of the home, but within two years had a financial crisis, leading to the inability to make the agreed upon loan payments to Barnett Bank. Barnett Bank then moved to foreclose on the property, citing the loan contract as the legal basis for their action. The Nelsons filed a lawsuit against Barnett Bank, arguing that the loan had been unfairly discriminatory and should be voided. The court disagreed with the Nelsons' argument and found in favor of Barnett Bank. The court found that the loan contract between the Nelsons and Barnett Bank was legal and enforceable, and that Barnett Bank had the right to foreclose on the property. The court concluded that the Nelsons had failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that the loan was unfairly discriminatory. Thus, the court upheld Barnett Bank’s right to foreclose on the property and affirmed the contractual loan agreement between the Nelsons and Barnett Bank. Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson provided legal precedence for the enforceability of loan contracts and the right of banks to foreclose on properties in cases of default.",

    " The 53rd Army was a major formation of the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II. It was created on 17 July 1941 in the Crimea and the Donbass region, located in the southern part of the Soviet Union. During the war, the 53rd Army fought in several major battles and campaigns including the Battle of Smolensk, the Battle of Kursk, and the Battle of Berlin. The 53rd Army initially was composed of four divisions, six artillery regiments, and two separate tank battalions. The Army was under the command of General Konstantin Rokossovsky. He was appointed to command the Army on 10 August 1941, after his predecessor had been removed from command. Rokossovsky quickly displayed his brilliance on the frontlines and was promoted to become a Colonel General while still serving in command of the 53rd Army. The 53rd Army was mainly formed to serve as a reserve force of the Red Army. This proved to be its primary role throughout the war, as it was frequently deployed to break through enemy lines and counter offensive actions taken by German troops. Throughout the war, the 53rd Army participated in several major battles, including the Battle of Smolensk, where it provided crucial support to the Red Army's counter-attack against the German offensive. At the Battle of Kursk, the 53rd Army played a major role in supporting the Soviet advance against the German lines. This support enabled numerous tank and infantry formations to penetrate deep into German occupied territory. At the Battle of Berlin, the 53rd Army again proved its value to the war effort by pushing back German forces in several sectors of the city. After the war, the 53rd Army was disbanded on 16 December 1945, having been awarded numerous honors for its service during the war. The unit's original commanders, such as General Rokossovsky, would go on to serve in other senior command roles within the post-war Soviet military. Today, the 53rd Army holds a special place in Russian military history. Its actions and its commanders serve as examples of the bravery of the Soviet military during the Great Patriotic War. The memory of the 53rd Army remains strong among both veterans of the war, as well as its successors in the modern Russian military.",
    " Legend Tripping is a form of folklore, in which a person, or a group of people visit a location where a legend or myth supposedly exist and take part in a ritual. It is an old phenomenon, and is based on the belief that supernatural entities may exist in certain places. Legend tripping is often associated with activities of a supernatural nature, including ghost hunting, séances, and searching for symbols of the supernatural, such as items associated with lost souls. Legend tripping began in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and is a popular activity today. Legend tripping might occur in the form of a single individual visiting the location of a haunting, or a group of people gathering at the site of a supposed supernatural event. Participants in legend tripping often look for evidence of a supernatural entity in the form of physical items (e.g. data collected by a psychic), vibrant stories or stories of past or present events, or residual hauntings or ghostly presences. Legend tripping has been identified in many different cultures worldwide. For example, in Japan, legend tripping often involves visiting locations that are either haunted or associated with spirits. According to popular belief, these sites house shadows, or “yurei”, and the spirits of these yurei are believed to be drawn to the site if it is visited by enough people. In Australia, legend tripping often involves visiting Aboriginal sacred sites and taking part in rituals that are believed to bring forth spirits of the dead. Today, legend tripping is a popular form of entertainment which has been spawned by the ubiquity of television shows dedicated to the paranormal and supernatural. Popular television shows often explore haunted locations, supernatural paraphernalia and the stories behind them, creating a demand for individuals and groups to search out such things on their own. This has led to an increase in individuals or groups visiting allegedly haunted sites, although this trend is not exclusive to such locations. Legends tripping is also practiced in non-haunted areas, such as national parks and old cemeteries, which are believed to contain secret or hidden treasures. Legend tripping can be a dangerous and even life-threatening activity, and is not recommended without adult supervision. It is important to remember that there is no scientific evidence that any supernatural being exists, and the risks associated with such activities may outweigh the reward. Always take proper precautions and follow guidance from experienced personnel when engaging in such activities.",
    " HMS Leopard was a 50-gun fourth rate ship of the English Royal Navy launched in 1790. She was built for use as a long-range cruiser and saw service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. She was also used as a transport vessel during the War of 1812. The Leopard was ordered on 27th April 1788 and built by William Barnett at his shipyard in Deptford. She was launched in May 1790 and commissioned in June of the same year. The ship was made from a design by Sir William Rule and was built to a tonnage of 1043 tons. In 1790 the Leopard set sail for the West Indies under the command of Captain Robert Barlow, where it took part in several anti-smuggling operations. After spending a year in the Caribbean the ship sailed back to England. In November 1793 the Leopard sailed under the command of Captain Henry Digby in an expedition against the French naval bases on the French Coast. The Leopard took part in numerous engagements during the expedition, with notable action being the capture of several French vessels. However, the Leopard soon ran out of supplies and was forced to return to England. In 1798, under the command of Captain William Gordon, the Leopard was sent to the Mediterranean to fight the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the mission, the Leopard captured numerous French vessels and ferried supplies to the Mediterranean theatres. In 1801, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Leopard participated in the blockade of French ports and also took part in patrols to hunt down French vessels. During this period, the Leopard captured several French vessels, including a 36-gun frigate. In 1806 the Leopard was decommissioned and served for a time as a prison ship, before becoming a hospital ship in 1808. In 1812, during the War of 1812, the Leopard was again recommissioned and served as a transport vessel. In 1814 the Leopard was retired and eventually broken up in May that year. The legacy of the Leopard remains in the form of paintings and engravings depicting the ship engaged in action. A painting by Willian Beechey and an etching by John Rose, both showing the Leopard in battle can be found in the National Maritime Museum in London. Today, there are various memorials to the Leopard, including a memorial plaque in Sheerness and a memorial in Deptford. The original launch book of the Leopard is currently on display in the Greenwich Maritime Museum, as a testament to the proud service of the ship and her crew.",
    " Lunar-A was a Japanese lunar mission launched by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in 1994. The project was part of the Japanese Space Exploration Program which included the team at ISAS and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The mission of the program was to study the Moon from Earth-based telescopes and by launching the Lunar-A spacecraft to the lunar surface. The Lunar-A spacecraft was launched on 8 August 1994 by an H-II rocket. The spacecraft had a total launch mass of 622 kg and consisted of two main components. The first component was the main spacecraft bus and the second component was the separate cruise stage. After launch, the lunar-A spacecraft separated from its cruise stage and began its journey to the Moon. The spacecraft was powered by a single SOZ-M-100 liquid apogee engine while the cruise stage used a Monopropellant Rocket Engine. The Lunar-A spacecraft arrived at the Moon seven days after launch and entered into a polar-orbiting trajectory. During the mission, the spacecraft mapped the lunar surface in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths in order to collect detailed topographic data. The mission was also used to study the lunar environment including the radiation environment and the solar wind interaction with the lunar surface. The spacecraft collected data for one week before its primary mission ended. During the mission, the Lunar-A spacecraft also deployed two 80 kg penetrators to the lunar surface. The penetrators were used to study the internal structure of the Moon including its gravity and magnetic fields. On 28 October 1998, Lunar-A reentered the Earth's atmosphere and was destroyed upon impact with the surface. Although the primary mission was completed, the data collected by the mission was used in subsequent missions and continues to be studied by scientists today. The Lunar-A mission was successful and resulted in many scientific discoveries. The mission demonstrated the ability of Japan to successfully launch and operate an interplanetary spacecraft and provided valuable insight into the lunar environment and formation. This mission also laid the foundation for further lunar exploration by Japan and other space agencies.",

Archelaus is best known for his work on the compilation of the Syrian Canons, or Rules of Church Discipline. His Early Life Little is known about Archelaus' life outside of his involvement in the church. It is believed to have been born in the city of Hierapolis. This is inferred from his writings in which he refers to it as his native town. He received his education from Eustathius of Antioch and became known as \"Theophilus of Hierapolis\" Writings Archelaus is best known for his work on the compilation of the Syriac Canons. This was a collection of ecclesiastical canons and rules of matrimony, public penance, and absolution. He was using the works of other Fathers and Schismatic authors, which he found in the Patriarchal Library of Antioch. He invoked the help of God and priestly spirit in the compilation.

    " Bourgeois Government refers to the form of government led by the bourgeois class. It is a capitalist regime, typically associated with democracies such as the U.S. and other Western countries. The main goal of bourgeois governments is to maximize profits for the affluent members of society and to ensure the economic stability of the nation. The primary focus of a bourgeois government is economic control and management. This type of regime seeks to stimulate economic growth and development through free-market policies and the liberalization of competition laws. Tax policies are designed to favor upper-class groups and businesses, while encouraging economic activity. Other economic goals include the protection of property rights and the promotion of free-market trade. Furthermore, governments wish to ensure that the state is able to capitalize on its own resources and to use them in the best way possible in order to benefit citizens. In addition, regulations impose and maintain necessary standards of behavior and practice in order to prevent fraud and unethical practices. Many political theorists have criticized bourgeois government for its reliance on economic measures to generate growth, instead of taking into account the long-term impact of certain policies on the social and physical environment. Critics argue that such a system leads to the growth of economic inequality and uneven income distribution. Furthermore, it often rewards speculative and wasteful investments and encourages irresponsible behaviour of certain sections of the economy. The concept of bourgeois government is also subject to numerous criticisms from both the left and the right. For example, some progressives view the government as a tool of the ruling class and view the policies of bourgeois government as a form of domination and control. From the right, bourgeois government has been criticized for being too interventionist and too restrictively regulated. In the end, bourgeois government has had an immense influence on the development of the Western world, and it has had both positive and negative effects. It has allowed for the amassing of incredible wealth, which has resulted in great improvements in technological advances and social conditions in certain countries. At the same time, some of the policies of bourgeois government have led to greater economic inequality and other social problems.",

    " Four Seasons (murals) refers to a series of four fresco murals painted by Italian Baroque master Pietro da Cortona between 1638 and 1639. The murals depict the four allegorical figures of the Greek myths of the four seasons in each of the four corners of Sala dei Virtù e delle Alcove (Room of Virtues and Alcoves) in Palazzo Pamphilj, Rome. Three of the four frescoes are still intact, with the larger and more prominent painting on the east wall. The fresco murals are divided into four panels, each on a separate wall of the room in Palazzo Pamphilj. The central fresco, the dramatic and dynamic \"Autumn, is depicted on the east wall, while the other three, \"Spring\", \"Summer\" and \"Winter\", are on the other walls. Each painting is an allegorical representation of the season it depicts: Autumn is colourful and festive, filled with singing and dancing farmers and revelers, while Winter shows a wintery landscape with a small nun praying in a forest and a poor beggar with his dog. Spring is a more serene composition, featuring a waterfall and a shepherd with a staff, while Summer is depicted as a bustling agricultural scene, with harvest ready crops and a farmer leading an enthusiastic team of workers. The murals display the characteristic Baroque style of the period and Cortona's dramatic compositions. His paintings have a distinct grandeur and drama, with their large canvases, strong diagonals and vivid, contrasting colours. Cortona's masterful brushwork can be seen in the lifelike details in the figures and the use of light and shadow to bring out their lively expressions and postures. The Frescoes are highly significant among Cortona's works, showcasing his acclaimed talents in painting monumental decorations for the wealthy clientele of Rome. The Four Seasons frescoes have been reproduced in numerous formats, including prints, engravings and ceramics, and are considered some of the most important murals in Roman Baroque art. They were declared a historic monument by the Italian government in 1921. The original fresco murals were rediscovered in 1896 and restored in 1938. The \"Spring\" and \"Winter\" frescoes are still largely complete and are displayed in the Pinacoteca at Palazzo Pamphilj, while the \"Summer\" fresco is completely lost. The \"Autumn\" fresco has been restored and is frequenty displayed in other venues such as the Palazzo Barberini and the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The Four Seasons frescoes are considered one of the great masterpieces of the Baroque period and are amongst the most important mural decorations to have survived from the 17th century. They remain a testament to Pietro da Cortona's artistic genius and technical skill and continue to inspire admirers to this day.",

    " The January 2020 Pennsylvania Turnpike crash was a chain-reaction crash that occurred on the night of January 5, 2020, along the Pennsylvania Turnpike near the Morgantown exit in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The incident involved nine vehicles and was overseen by the Pennsylvania State Police. The crash resulted in five deaths, including four members of the same family, and several other people injured. The severe winter storm the previous week was thought to be the ultimate cause of the crash. The victims of the crash included four members of a family from Somerville, New Jersey. The family had been visiting Lancaster, Pennsylvania earlier in the day, and were heading to New Jersey on their return trip home when the crash occurred. In total, there were three adults and two children in their minivan, all of whom died in the crash. The other victims of the crash were the drivers of four other vehicles, as well as two passengers in one of the other cars. Unfortunately, all five fatalities succumbed to their injuries as a result of the crash. The crash occurred as a result of a series of collisions that took place over the span of several minutes. Initially, several vehicles traveling in the center lane collided due to dense fog and poor visibility. A few moments later, a minivan traveling behind the initial vehicles collided with the damaged vehicles, and eventually the minivan was pushed by the other cars into the median barrier. The minivan then slammed into the barrier, killing all four of the family members inside. Following the minivan was a tractor-trailer, which did its best to avoid the crash, but ultimately collided with the unresponsive minivan. The Pennsylvania State Police reported that the incident was a result of hazardous conditions from a previous winter storm. However, it was later revealed that the impact of the crash was made worse by a number of other factors, including the failure of several drivers to adhere to the speed limit, a lack of proper signage, and the dense fog and poor visibility that had set in following the storm. In the wake of the crash, an investigation was launched by the Pennsylvania State Police. This investigation included several interviews with the drivers, who maintained that they had followed all applicable laws and regulations prior to the crash. In addition, a detailed analysis was conducted of the entire stretch of the turnpike, as well as a review of the procedures and regulations enforced by the turnpike authority. Ultimately, the crash was determined to be an unavoidable event, caused by the severe winter weather and the inability of the drivers to avoid multiple collisions due to the severe fog. In response to the crash, the Pennsylvania State Police announced a series of updates to improve safety and signage along the turnpike, including stricter enforcement of speed limits and clearer signage regarding hazardous conditions. In April of 2020, a memorial service was held to honor and remember the victims of the crash.",

    " 2797 Teucer (provisional designation 1984 ST) is a uniquely shaped centaur asteroid located in the outer Solar System between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. It was discovered on September 22, 1984, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The centaur is named after the Greek hero Teucer, son of King Telamon of Salamis and father of bird-ruler King Alastor of Cyprus. At around 30 kilometers in diameter, 2797 Teucer is a relatively large asteroid and is believed to have been dynamically active in the past. It is thought to have been influenced by gravitational perturbations, most likely due to close encounters with the planets Jupiter and Neptune, which explains its highly elongated orbit. The body has a dynamical orbital period of 8.9 years and orbits the Sun at an average distance of 10.3 AU, having a perihelion of 8.45 AU and an aphelion just beyond 12.9 AU. The eccentricity of its orbit is 0.39 and its perihelion location is 7.4° below the ecliptic plane. Observations of 2797 Teucer have revealed a rotation period of about 10 hours. Its reflectivity and color shows that the chemistry of its surface is probably similar to that of other primitive asteroids such as D-type asteroids, suggesting the presence of plausible organic and silicate materials. In 2020, Teucer was observed by the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) team, one of the first surveys of trans-Neptunian objects, in order to increase the understanding of the evolution of outer solar system objects. The OSSOS research showed that this centaur was most likely captured from the Jupiter-family comet population. Furthermore, its light-curve amplitude indicated that it is likely to be a triaxial object, making it of general interest for dynamical and physical studies of outer Solar System bodies. In 2021, a paper published by The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada reported on the spectroscopic reflectance variability and spectral similarities between Teucer and other centaur objects. 2797 Teucer is an interesting object due to its peculiar orbit and size. It is representative of the primordial solar system and reveals important information about the evolution of planetary bodies in the outer Solar System.",

Cloning is a process in which a single computer is used to create an exact duplicate of another computer. The clone is then used as the source of the data and software applications. Cloning is used to replicate software or data in a computer system and is used in the entertainment industry to create software compilations and virtual copies of video works. The process can also be used to create a backup of a system and its applications. Cloning can also be used to create an exact replica of a software environment on a different computer system. This process is called sandboxing and is used for testing, training and education purposes. Cloning is also used in security and safety measures. When a system is compromised or subjected to attack by viruses, a clone is created to reset the system back to its original operating condition. This ensures that any malicious software or malware has been removed from the system and a fresh start is made. Cloning is a complex process that involves an in-depth knowledge of software and hardware components. It requires accurate data collection and analysis to ensure that the clone system maintains the integrity and functionality of the original system. Clone systems are usually more expensive than standard systems, as they require a higher level of sophistication and customization. The potential risks associated with cloning can be minimized by regularly updating and patching the clone systems. Cloning is a powerful tool for businesses, organisations and individuals. It enables a precise duplication of software or data which can be used to restore or create a new system from an existing one. This also reduces the amount of time taken to restore or transfer a system from one computer to another. The ability to create a precise clone of a system's data and software provides businesses and organisations with the flexibility to build on previous ideas and increase efficiency and productivity. Cloning can also be used to create powerful copies of popular software applications, allowing them to be used by multiple users with little effort. Cloning is a process that has become increasingly popular in the computing industry as it enables quick duplication of software and data, creating greater efficiency and security. As computing technology advances, the cloning process is expected to become increasingly cost effective and secure.",

    " \"Poor Little Fool\" is a song recorded by Rick Nelson and released in August 1958 as the first single from his album Ricky. It is notable for being the first song ever to reach the Number 1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was composed by Sharon Sheeley, who had previously written and performed the 1957 hit single \"Dum Dum\". Not long after its release \"Poor Little Fool\" overtook and replaced \"Tequila\" as the chart leader. It stayed at the top spot for two weeks, and earned Nelson his first gold record in October 1958. Nelson had previously worked with Sheeley and her then-boyfriend, Eddie Cochran. During those sessions, Nelson became intrigued by a poem she had written. He decided to set the poem to music, with Sheeley co-writing new lyrics. She was also given the writing credit for the song, although Nelson was not credited as a writer. The lyrics describe how a girl has been fooled by an untrustworthy man, although it was not clear if it was written about a real-life experience. The song's lyrics are sung from a first-person perspective and this gave the recording a certain depth that had not been found in other rock 'n' roll recordings. Nelson's recording of \"Poor Little Fool\" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll, and VH1 named it the 13th greatest song of the 50s. It was further included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list at No. 257. In January 2006, Nelson's version of the song was named as one of the Songs Of The Century by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. It was also ranked No. 7 on Billboards list of the Top 100 Songs Of The Rock Era. The song has since been covered by a variety of artists, including Neil Young, Simple Plan, Howie Day, and others. A remake of \"Poor Little Fool\" by country music singer Clay Walker was featured in an episode of the television series The O.C. in 2004. Walker's version was featured as the title track for his 2005 Greatest Hits compilation, and it was also released as a single.",
    " Stealing First Base, also known as stealing home, is a play in baseball in which a runner on-base attempts to advance to the next base without the aid of a batted ball. It is one of the most exciting and daring plays in baseball and is seen frequently in the major leagues. When successful, the play can be the difference between a win and a loss for the team’s win-loss record. Stealing first is regarded as the most difficult base-stealing play, as the runner must reach the bag with only the break of his leadfoot. The pitcher provides the distraction, as he must be focused on the hitter and not on the runner. Speed and audacity are required to pull off a successful steal. The runner must also rely on the vigilance of the pitcher and catcher. When the pitcher or catcher notices the runner attempting to steal a base, they have a few options. The most common, and the one recommended by professionals, is to step off the rubber and, if time allows, make a throw towards the base. Other methods include a throw directly to the base, the catcher making a quick move towards the base, or the pitcher making a quick glance towards the base. It is important for a runner to remember that in order to steal a base, he must not be tagged before he crosses it. The catcher can also attempt to field the pitch, as well as utilize the pickoff move. The pitcher’s pickoff move is when the pitcher looks towards the runner and attempts to tag him before he reaches the bag. When a successful steal happens, the crowd goes wild. First base steals may be risky, but if done correctly, the risk pays off and the team benefits from an extra runner. Watching a runner steal a base is an exciting play that can happen at any moment in the game and it is always a thrilling to watch a runner successfully steal first.",
    " Marco Coltellini (born 1965) is an Italian photographer and photojournalist. He is best known for his work covering conflict zones, refugee communities, and the effects of war and poverty around the world. Coltellini was born in the small Italian town of Grosseto, where he lived until moving to Siena to study photography in the early 1990s. It was during this period that he developed a passion for photography and a fascination with the medium’s ability to document history, reflect reality, and reveal the way humans interact with their environment. One of Coltellini’s first major projects was a photo reportage on the Bosnian War, in which he travelled to trying cities to document the destruction caused by the conflict. His work was published in Italian newspapers, and earned him national recognition for the first time. In the following years, Marco Coltellini continued to travel not only in the Balkans, but in other war-torn regions across the globe, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Lebanon. What sets his photos apart is an intimate take on the communities he encountered, which allowed him to provide an accurate picture of the living conditions in these places. In addition to his work as a photojournalist, Marco Coltellini has also worked as a professor and mentor, teaching photography classes at universities in Europe and the United States. In 2011, Coltellini’s 20-year-old son, Luca, died in the Arab Spring riots in Cairo. His death marks the beginning of a creative process in which Coltellini seeks to create an archive of memories and feelings in honor of his son. The corresponding photo series and book, 'The Memory of Luca', was awarded the Noor Multi-level Grant by the World Press Photo organization. Coltellini continues to document and photograph people in conflict-torn countries today and his work has been featured in national and international publications such as National Geographic, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Time Magazine. He resides in Italy, where he is currently working on a documentary film entitled ‘The Shame of Italy’ that examines the human cost of the country’s continued immigration policies. Throughout his career, Marco Coltellini has worked to document and give voice to those who are most affected by war, displacement and poverty. He has earned numerous awards for his dedication to capturing and telling stories of conflict, fear and resilience.",
    " A seismometer, also known as a seismograph, is a device used to measure, record, and detect seismic activity. The device is typically composed of a strong base and a seismometer, which typically uses a weight and pendulum to detect vibrations in the ground. Seismometers are important tools in seismology, a branch of geophysics that studies earthquakes and their waves. Seismometer readings are used to understand more about the nature of earthquakes and other seismic events, and to predict potential disasters. The earliest seismometers were based on a tilt sensor that measured the angle of the ground relative to the horizon, then converting the measured tilt into a proportion of the intensity and magnitude of an earthquake. This type of device was used by the ancient Chinese to measure earthquakes in the second century BC. Modern seismometers, however, have undergone a significant evolution. Digital seismometers, also known as digital seismographs, are much more advanced than their predecessors. They utilize a variety of methods, including motion sensors and accelerometers, for measuring ground motion generated by seismic waves. Different types of digital seismometers have various capabilities, with some being able to measure both horizontal (from side to side) and vertical (from top to bottom) motion. Modern seismometers are also very sensitive in order to accurately measure motion, and can detect vibrations that are partially caused by human activities such as construction and traffic. They can also detect ground tremors caused by natural phenomena such as landslides and earthquakes. This information can be used by seismologists and engineers to understand more about the underlying causes of an earthquake and to make predictions about future seismic events. Seismometers are also helpful in detecting underground nuclear tests and other activities of humans. The data collected by the seismometer can be used to detect any potential nuclear tests that are conducted underground, therefore helping to reduce the chance of an international nuclear incident. In addition to providing seismic information, seismometers can also be used in energy exploration. By detecting vibrations from deep beneath the surface of the Earth, seismometers can help detect underground deposits of oil and gas. This type of data can be used for geologic mapping and for locating areas of high petroleum potential. Seismometers are an invaluable device for usage in research, energy exploration, and for predicting the effects of seismic activity. As technology develops and becomes more advanced, the capabilities of seismometers have also greatly improved. They have become an essential tool in the fields of geophysics, energy exploration, and in helping to protect humans from harm caused by natural phenomena such as earthquakes.",
    " I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star) was a 1971 single by the American gospel quartet The Blind Boys of Alabama. The song was composed and arranged by album producer Johnny Fields and was recorded at Fame Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The song is notable as the Blind Boys' first secular single, a move that was considered by many to be sacrilegious at the time. The single was a minor hit on R&B radio, as well as receiving some limited airplay on rock radio in the United States. The song has since been covered by various musical acts over the years, including Bonnie Raitt and Kim Weston. It has also been featured in the films The Apostle (1997) and We Are Marshall (2006). I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star) is a mid-tempo gospel-soul song that features lead vocals from Clarence Fountain, backed by the other members of the Blind Boys. The track also includes Bill Helm on piano, Raymond Moore on guitar, and Clarence Carter and David Hood on bass. The song uses a chorus of backing vocalists to enhance the sound. The lyrics feature a comparison between a gospel singer's recognition of Jesus and the star-studded admiration of the same figure. The singer proclaims, \"They say that He's the King of Kings / But I knew Jesus before all those things / He's still my Lord, no matter who sings\". The song is often interpreted as a statement of faith, in which the singer refuses to be swayed by the praise of the masses. The Blind Boys of Alabama have included \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" in their live sets ever since its original release, and it has become one of their signature songs over the years. The group have also recorded several gospel sequels to the track, such as \"He's Still My Lord Again and Again\". I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" remains a classic cut in the Blind Boys of Alabama discography, and continues to be an influence on spiritual music to this day.",

    " The Dissolution of Czechoslovakia was a peaceful dissolution of the former nation of Czechoslovakia that began on November 25th, 1992 and was completed on January 1st, 1993. Its heritage shares roots in the history of several different nations, including the Czechs and Slovaks. The dissolution ended 75 years of continuous existence of the nation of Czechoslovakia and ultimately carved out two new sovereign states: The Czech Republic and Slovakia. The dissolution was peaceful and not caused by civil unrest or international intervention; it was driven by a growing desire for greater autonomy within the two entities of the former state. Czech and Slovak citizens had very distinct cultural backgrounds and different experiences under the communist regime; this contributed to the decision to dissolve Czechoslovakia. Another factor was the changing political forces in Europe; the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 affected the unity of Czechoslovakia and the two countries went from being allies in a tier of Eastern Bloc nations to having different geopolitical interests and ambitions. The legislative dissolution of Czechoslovakia was renamed the “Act on the Agreement for the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia”, with representatives from the Czech Republic and Slovakia signing it in Prague on December 26th, 1992. The document outlined the dissolution of the federal state and created a clear path forward for each republic to function as independent states. Other internationally binding documents were signed between the two countries regarding the peaceful transition and joint area management such as the “Bratislava Agreement”. This agreement specified financial regulations, privatization of certain enterprises, and jointly managed economic operations. The effects of the dissolution were widely positive in terms of economic growth and human rights. The newly created states developed extensively; while there was an initial decline in the gross domestic product, it eventually increased to higher levels than prior to the dissolution, positively affecting the Republics’s citizens. Human rights also improved for both countries; following the federalization of their governments and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Czech Republic and Slovakia established a more democratic and free government. Although the dissolution of Czechoslovakia was a peaceful transition, some tensions remain between the two countries. However, the dissolution of the former state has allowed both nations to develop independently and create their own identities. The legacy of the dissolution will be shaped by the two independent countries it created, and the experiences of those individuals who lived in the former state. In conclusion, the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992 marked a new chapter in the history of Eastern Europe. It freed the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the oppressive Soviet rule and enabled the citizens of both nations to gain independence, economic progress and improved human rights. The legacy of the dissolution will have a lasting effect on the history of the region and the two independent countries.",

    " Ramos de Azevedo was a Brazilian architect, musician and engineer, widely considered one of the greatest Brazilian architects of the modernist period. Born in São Paulo, in August 16th, 1887, Ramos de Azevedo was the grandson of Carlos de Ramos de Azevedo, the founder of São Paulo Railway. He started his studies in Brazil, but in 1910, he was sent by his family to Europe to improve his studies in architecture. During that period, he visited different places and cities, as London, Rome and Paris, idealizing several works in different countries. When he returned to Brazil, Ramos de Azevedo was hired by the municipal engineering of the city of São Paulo. He worked in the sanitation of the traditional City'S old center and in the organization of the neighborhoods. Soon, the master was appointed as technical director of the municipal works and president of the Urbanization Commission. He was the designer of some of the most important buildings in the city of São Paulo, such as Copan Building, Martinelli Building and Los Angeles Building, and some of the most visited parks in the city. Later, in a collaboration with his father – also an engineer – Ramos de Azevedo designed the Burle Marx Park, in collaboration with the famous landscape designer, Burle Marx. He was also awarded the title of Official of the Industrial Service of the province of São Paulo, and was awarded the Silva Ramos Prize in Architecture, one of the most important prizes in the area in Brazil. He was also President of the São Paulo Railway Company and a member of the International Olympic Committee. In 1940, the master died at the age of 53 years, but left a legacy of influence in the city of São Paulo and in Brazilian architecture. His works, for example, Copan Building, besides being considered one of the most important works of modernist architecture in Brazil, also resulted from the efferent imagination and innovative trends used by Ramos de Azevedo. It is said that the places with his projects as much in São Paulo as in other Brazilian cities, are still praised for its beauty, uniqueness and innovation. As a result of that, his projects are usually included in World Heritage lists, even in the present days. In conclusion, the name of Ramos de Azevedo is one of the most important and remembered names in Brazilian architecture and his works, in spite of time, are still a reference of engineering, design and imagination.

    " Christian courtship is the traditional practice of seeking romantic relationships with the purpose of finding a life-long spouse. This process includes several stages, such as getting to know each other, developing a friendship, honoring purity, and preparing for a long-term commitment through accountability, prayer and accountability. Traditionally, couples seeking to marry held each other in high esteem, made the decision to marry only after serious consideration, prayed for direction from God and valued their parents’ counsel. Other characteristics of Christian courtship may include no physical contact until marriage (excluding holding hands), modest dress, saving physical expressions of affection for marriage, and commitment to the Church community as well as the couple’s families. Christian courtship is not about recreational dating or casual relationships; rather, it is about choosing someone to pursue a meaningful and long-term relationship with. The period of courtship should be an intentional yet enjoyable time of getting to know someone, discerning if they are the rightful partner and opening oneself to the possibility of marriage. There are three main components integral to the Christian courtship process: prayer, communication and accountability. Couples should regularly pray together, talk about their intentions and future, and form relationships with other couples who are supportive of the process. Today, Christian organization have created a variety of support systems to help couples who are going through the courtship process. In the dating world of today, there is a need for more balanced and intentional approaches to relationships. Christian courtship offers a theology and practice that stands in contrast to many of the more casual, often noncommittal approaches to relationships found in contemporary society. People who practice Christian courtship believe that, when done correctly, it can deepen their walk with God and help them to find a spouse who is similar in belief. Ultimately, Christian courtship is a journey to appreciate and respect the other’s worth, the journey towards a perfect union, the journey towards a blessed and eternal marriage. It is the journey of two individuals and families, who are fully equipped and ready to be presented to one another on their wedding day.",

    " Einar Englund (June 15, 1916 – March 13, 1999) was a Finnish composer and pianist. His music is firmly rooted in late romanticism, displaying a strong influence from Sibelius and Bartók. Englund wrote seven symphonies, three of which were premiered at the prestigious Stockholm Concert Hall. Englund was born in Vääksy, near the city of Lahti in Finland in 1916. As a child, he was already exposed to the classic music of the era, such as the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. As he grew older, Englund began taking piano lessons, and his prodigious talent was soon recognised. He studied at the Sibelius Academy between 1936 and 1943, studying piano, theory and composition. A touring concert pianist, Englund wrote his first large-scale works during the 1940s. These works include his Symphony No. 1 (1945-1946), Symphony No. 2 (1947-1948), and Piano Concerto (1947-1948). His compositions characteristically feature a mix of nationalist Finnish melodic elements with the structural aspects of neo-classicism, as well as elements of jazz, Bartók and Hindemith. Englund's works of the 1950s, such as Symphony No. 3 (1951), Symphony No. 4 (1952), and Symphony No. 5 (1955), are often considerered to be his main achievement. The greatest success of his career came with his Symphony No. 6, which won the 1959 Nordic Music Prize. This particular symphony brought him international recognition as a major Finnish composer. His next symphony, Symphony No. 7 (1963-1964), was inspired by the works of Sibelius, and was dedicated to him. During the 1970s, he wrote numerous pieces, including orchestral, choral and vocal works. Englund's last symphony, Symphony No. 8, was written in 1981, and he also wrote several chamber works and songs during this time. Einar Englund died in 1999, leaving behind an expansive catalogue of symphonic, theatrical, and chamber works. His influence is still felt today, and although he has not achieved widespread recognition, the Finnish music world still cherishes his legacy.",
    " Roman Mints were an important part of the Roman economy for centuries. The mints served as a means of producing coins and other forms of currency in order to facilitate trade and commerce. Mints throughout the Roman Empire were organized in a variety of ways, with some located in major cities and others in influential locations such as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. The coins produced were made of bronze, silver, and gold, with some coins having a value spelled out in Greek or Latin. These coins acted as a medium of exchange for goods and services and were essential to the Roman economy. Mints were also used to produce metal pieces called medallions, which were used as rewards for Roman military commanders and allies for their services The diversity and complexity of coins created by the Roman mints speaks to the importance of commerce in Roman society. Coins bore images of rulers, gods, animals, buildings, and other symbols. Other coins, such as the sestertius, featured complex images and elaborate designs. Much of the Roman economy was based on bartering goods and services, but the Roman mints served as a means of moving money from one place to another and facilitated trade at a level not seen in earlier civilizations. The Roman mints were not controlled by the government, but rather operated by private citizens. The cost of producing the coins was high, but this cost was offset by charging a fee for each coin minted. This fee was called a fee per die and was imposed by the workshop producing coins. The mints also charged customers a fee for exchanging coins of different values. In the early days of the Roman Empire, coins were hand-struck. This process was replaced by machine-striking in the 7th century, allowing mints to dramatically increase the production of coins. This increased production enabled the mints to keep up with the demands of trade, ensuring a smoothly functioning economy. The mints in the Roman Empire eventually lost their importance and decline in the 8th century due to the lack of infrastructure and the rise of taxation. By the end of the 9th century, the minting of coins had ceased and mints had all but disappeared. Despite this, the legacy of the Roman mints remains, as their influence can still be seen in the coins used today.",
    " The Kansas City Southern Depot located in Zwolle, Louisiana is a historic train depot located off of Highway 191 in Zwolle. It is one of only two remaining depots of the Kansas City, Pittsburg, and Gulf Railroad line, which was operated by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more commonly known as the Frisco. The structure was built in 1911 and is owned by the Town of Zwolle which purchased the building in 1989. The historic building is of a particular architectural style readily identifiable amongst the Frisco's depots, which were built throughout the southeast in the early twentieth century.

    " Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 - September 22, 2010) was an American student who attended Rutgers University. In September 2010, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in New York City. His death was the result of cyberbullying reportedly brought on by his college roommates, who had spied on him when he was having a romantic meeting with another man. Clementi was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey and was the son of Joseph and Jane Clementi. He attended Ridgewood High School where he was an accomplished violinist. He was a member of the local orchestra. After high school, he attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he was studying science. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, and another student, Molly Wei, used a webcam to secretly film him during a romantic encounter with another man. The video was then posted on the internet. The incident received national media attention and sparked intense public outcry against cyberbullying and gay bias. Clementi discovered the footage and posted a short tweet on September 21, which read, “Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.\" On the night of September 22, he posted a final Facebook status saying, \"jumping off the gw bridge, goodbye.\" The next day, Clementi's body was identified when it washed up on the Hudson River shoreline. His death was ruled as a suicide. Although both Ravi and Wei were initially charged with invasion of privacy and related crimes, both eventually accepted plea deals, which included no jail time. Clementi's death prompted a national debate on cyberbullying and ultimately led to the passage of new anti bullying laws throughout the United States. Many universities and organizations have established awards in honor of Clementi's memory, such as the Tyler Clementi Foundation, dedicated to ending bullying and creating safe online environments for young adults. Tyler Clementi's legacy lives on in the fight against online and in-person bullying. His tragedy has been immortalized in novels, documentaries, and musicals.

    " Vishnupant Damle is a Marathi silent film from 1922, directed by Damle and Fatehlal and produced by All India Photo Features. It is considered to be the first Marathi feature film, and the first Marathi film with playback singing. The movie was based on the novel Saraswati-Chandra by Govardhanram Tripathi, and was released theatrically on 18 May 1922. The movie was written and directed by Vitthal Phalke's son-in-law, Damle and his partner Fatehlal. The cast included Vishnupant Damle (co-director of the film), Bhalji Pendharkar, Gajananbua Jadhav, and Kunjalata Khadilkar. The cinematography was handled by Ganpat Nene, and it was edited by Ratnakar Pandit. Vishnupant Damle was shot in a primitive studio system with prints made of nitrate film. Due to the lack of highly developed sound recording technology at the time, it was a silent movie. It featured two-reel fragments of music and songs. The lyrics of these fragments were written by Vishnupant Damle, and sung by Pandurang Kastur, the first playback singer of Marathi cinema. The movie features a love triangle between Panduranga (Vishnu Pant Damle), Narada (Gajananbua Jadhav) and Saraswati (Kunjalata Khadilkar). Saraswati's father obstructs the love affair from taking place, since Narada is from a lower caste. After a struggle, the lovers get finally united. Vishnupant Damle brought about a major revolution in Marathi cinema, being one of the first movies to feature songs and music accompanied by orchestra. It also set the standard for Marathi feature films that were to be produced in the future, both in terms of characterization and narration. The movie was embroiled in controversy due to the censors objecting to the subject matter that spoke of the ill-treatment and discrimination of the lower caste people. It eventually won the hearts of the viewers after much struggle and deliberation, and went on to become a huge success across the country, paving the way for the Marathi film industry to survive and grow in the future. The movie has since been preserved for posterity by the National Film Archive of India.",

    " A miarolitic cavity is a type of natural formation found in igneous rocks. It is named after the word miarolite, which is a mineral found in these cavities. This type of cavity is characterized by a concentric spherical arrangement of hexagonal or sub-hexagonal crystals that are formed by expanding gas bubbles within the host rock. These gas bubbles cause the rock to form an outwardly expanding spherulitic lattice of concentric rings or arcs of radiating crystals. This type of cavity is most commonly found in granites, but can also occur in some other objects, such as volcanic bombs. Miarolitic cavities form when volatile gases, usually carbon dioxide and/or water vapor, become trapped inside the rock during its formation. These gases often contain dissolved elements, such as gold, silver, fluorite, or uranium. As the element-enriched gas bubble cools and crystallizes, the crystals begin to expand and form a lattice-like pattern that radiates outward from the center of the cavity. The process is similar to the way a pearl is formed. The crystals that make up the miarolitic cavity tend to be composed of quartz and feldspar, with traces of biotite, micas, and sulfide minerals in some cases. The cavity walls are generally covered with a veneer of druzy quartz. This veneer is formed when the gas bubble implodes and re-crystallizes as it collapses to form a thin coating of quartz crystals on the inside of the miarolitic walls. Miarolitic cavities are formed in open spaces within the rock, such as vesicles in volcanic rock and voids between crystals in granites. They are usually only a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter, though they can be up to several meters in some cases. Miarolitic cavities are often associated with economic mineral deposits. They sometimes contain valuable ore minerals, and the presence of these cavities can indicate a mineral deposit in the surrounding rock. Miarolitic cavities can also form in rocks that contain hydrothermal fluids and are sometimes important sites of precipitation for minerals. In some cases, these cavities can be mined for gold, silver, or other rare minerals. Miarolitic cavities are interesting geological formations, as they have unique geometries and can contain valuable ore minerals. They are easily identified in most cases, though their small size can make them hard to find. Because of their association with ore deposits, miarolitic cavities can be a great indicator for mineral exploration.",

    " X-tree is a type of data structure used to store and retrieve data in computer programs. It is similar to a binary tree, but has an additional constraint. It was proposed by the computer scientists C.A.R. Hoare and Jens Myrup Pedersen in 1982. A X-tree is a type of tree-based data structure where each node can have no more than a predetermined number of children. This predetermined number is referred to as the arity of the tree. For example, a binary tree has an arity of two, meaning that each node can only have two children. A X-tree is similar, but allows for a higher arity. The advantage of using a X-tree is the increased flexibility in terms of storing the data. Unlike a binary tree, which requires a specific data arrangement, a X-tree can store a wide variety of shapes and sizes of data. For example, it can be used to store a list of items, such as a phone book or a dictionary, or it can be used to store tree-structured data, such as a database of financial records. A X-tree can also be used to store multi-dimensional data, such as a packet routing table or a geographic information system. This is because they allow the data to be broken down into smaller and easier to manage chunks, thus simplifying the process of searching and retrieving data. The primary disadvantage of using a X-tree is that it can be difficult to manage due to its higher arity. The number of nodes needed to store a given amount of data can increase drastically as the amount of data increases. This can lead to problems such as long search times, and increased complexity when trying to make changes or additions to the data. X-trees can also be slow to access due to the increased number of nodes needed to store the data, which can lead to performance issues. X-trees are a useful data structure for many types of applications, and are often used in medical and financial applications, where large amounts of data need to be stored and quick access is critical. Despite their advantages, however, they can be difficult to manage and require careful optimization to achieve good performance.",

    " Phyllachora maydis, commonly known as the Corn Smut fungus, is a common fungal pathogen found on maize and teosinte. It is a large genus of fungi, belonging to the class Pucciniomycetes. It is native to Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of the United States, but it can also be found in other parts of the world where maize is grown. Corn smut is a disease that affects the ear, kernel, stalk, tassel, and other parts of the maize plant. The fungus produces large, swollen tissue caused by the growth of mycelium. When the smut is mature, the swollen tissue ruptures and releases black spore masses or \"galls\" which contain millions of spores. These spores can spread through the air, water, wildlife, and through machinery, making it difficult to completely remove the fungus from the affected area. The infected plant is weakened, and it may also produce fewer ears and the quality of the corn may be lower. Corn smut can reduce yield by up to 80%. The most effective way to prevent the spread of corn smut is to rotate crops, planting a different crop in the same field every year. Disease resistant maize hybrids can also help prevent the disease. Chemical fungicides, or biological control agents such as Trichoderma harzianum, may also be used to reduce the emergence of the disease. Current research is being done to better understand the biology of Phyllachora maydis, as well as to find genetic markers which could be used to develop more disease-resistant hybrids of maize. This would drastically reduce the impact of this fungi on the maize industry. Phyllachora maydis is an important pathogen of maize and teosinte, and can cause drastic yield losses. It is important to practice crop rotation and use disease-resistant hybrids or fungicides to help prevent the spread of this fungus.",
    " Anna Swanwick (born 2 April 1847, died 24 November 1921) was an American educator and a pioneer of the feminist education movement. She was a strong advocate for equal rights for women, and she believed that education should not be limited to what was traditionally considered appropriate for each gender. Swanwick was born in Philadelphia, the daughter of Quaker parents. Her mother, Susannah Pollock Swanwick, was a gender-equality activist and her father, John Swanwick, was a prominent politician and lawyer. Swanwick was educated at home until the age of 10 and then entered the Quaker Academy of Westtown in Pennsylvania, where she studied mathematics, science and philosophy. In 1868, Swanwick graduated with honors from Westtown and then went on to attend the newly established Garrett Biblical Institute in Evanston, in Illinois. Here she studied an eclectic mix of subjects which included Greek and Latin, logic, history, administration and theology. Particularly influential upon her educational development was her study of the works of John Stuart Mill, the British philosopher who was an exponent of gender equality. After graduating from Garrett, Swanwick returned to Philadelphia and began her work as an educator. In 1878 Swanwick founded a school for girls, the Cliveden School of Philosophy, which taught a progressive curriculum emphasizing broad intellectual development. The school became a model for progressive education, leading the wave of modern education for women in the period before the advent of women's colleges. In 1888 Swanwick was invited to become the first president of the newly founded Women’s Education Association, an organization dedicated to the advancement of higher education for women. In the same year, she was also appointed an inspector of the Society for the Higher Education of Women. These roles saw Swanwick travelling extensively throughout the United States and Europe, offering counsel on matters relating to feminism, as well as promoting educational opportunities for women. Further to her reputation within education circles, Swanwick was a prominent literary figure. An accomplished essayist and poet, her works were included in numerous anthologies, and a few of her books were published independently. In 1921, Swanwick passed away at the age of 74 after a long illness. After her death, the Women's Education Association commissioned a bronze bust in her honor, and the Cliveden School of Philosophy was renamed in her honor: the Anna Swanwick School. Today, Swanwick is remembered as a pioneer of the women's education movement and an advocate for greater educational opportunities and civil rights for women.",

    " Jean the Birdman (born 1919, died 2010) was a renowned pioneer of modern avian genetics, commonly referred to as the father of avian genetics. Born in France, Jean had a strong interest in animals from a young age. He would often spend time bird watching in his local woods, learning about the various species, their behavior and migration patterns. He soon began to pursue formal study in biology, and eventually graduated from a university in France with a degree in veterinary medicine. After completing his studies, Jean went on to become an avid researcher of avian genetics. Jean the Birdman's first major breakthrough came after he identified a valuable mutation in chickens called the Feeble Wing Syndrome. He used this mutation to selectively breed chickens with larger wings, thus creating some of the earliest examples of modern poultry breeds. Jean's research of avian genetics continued, and he soon focused his attention on the cross-breeding of several different species of birds. He was able to successfully create hybrid birds exhibiting traits associated with both their parent species. This work was revolutionary at the time, and laid the foundations of modern modern avian genetics. Jean’s work made him a well-known figure in the world of science, and he went on to share his knowledge with many people through lectures and publications.

    " Ephippiger terrestris, commonly known as the common spotted grasshopper, is a species of insect in the family Acrididae. It is found in France and a number of Mediterranean countries, including Italy, Spain, and Greece. It is recognized as a pest in some parts of Europe and a number of countries have issued import restrictions on agricultural goods linked to the species. Ephippiger terrestris is a medium-sized, moth-like grasshopper. It is typically brown in color with spots on the tegmina and hindwings, although these can range from plain to uniformly colored. The head and legs are usually yellowish-brown, and the antennae are relatively long in comparison with other members of the Acrididae family. Males and females can be distinguished by their wing size and shape; males possess much larger wings than females. The species is sexually dimorphic and exhibits courtship and mating behaviors typical of grasshoppers. The female lays her eggs in the soil during the early autumn within small burrows, typically in warm, dry areas. The eggs remain dormant over the winter months and hatch in the springtime. The larvae undergo five instars before they reach maturity, typically between July and August. Adults typically live for between 3 and 6 months. The diet of E. terrestris consists of a range of grasses and other vegetation, but is strongly dependent on the local ecology of each population and may vary considerably between areas. The species is carnivorous and is known to feed on other small insects, such as aphids and other immature insects. The species is of agricultural importance due to its potential to damage and consume commercially important plants. Control strategies for the species vary based on geographical circumstances and may include biological control strategies such as releasing predatory species or insect parasitoids. Pesticide applications have also been recorded although their effectiveness is debatable. Ephippiger terrestris is considered a species of conservation concern due to its restricted extent of occurrence, small population size, and continuing declines in the quality of its habitat. The species is listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened and is included in Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive. Conservation efforts should focus on the protection of existing habitat, as well as the creation of new habitats through restoration and management.",
    " Barham is a small village in the district of Huntingdonshire in the East of England. It lies approximately 4 miles southeast of St Neots. It is situated close to the border with Cambridgeshire to the east, and the A1(M) motorway to the north and south. The history of Barham dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period. The name Barham could come from the Old English words \"bere\" (barley) and \"ham\" (monastery) or from \"bereham\" (barley homestead). Barham was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a small manor belonging to the Abbey of St Peter at Westminster. It then remained part of that religious estate until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, when it was granted to the Crown. The village lies on a low stream of the River Great Ouse which runs along the eastern edge of Barham. Historically, the village was an important trading centre for the area, but its importance declined in the 19th century as the railway network grew and the area became more industrialized.

The church also houses a vaulted crypt, an organ and a tower, accessible only by a spiral staircase. The old Barham railway station was serviced by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, which ran along an east-west track from St Neots to King's Lynn. The station was closed in 1959 after passenger services were withdrawn from the line in 1959. Barham today is a quiet village, well placed for access to many of the attractions of the Huntingdonshire area.

    " Inspirations for James Bond is an exploration of the historical and cultural factors that influence the character of James Bond, codenamed \"007\" in the popular series of novels and films. First appearing in the 1953 novel Casino Royale, the character of James Bond has become one of the most iconic characters in the culture of the 20th and 21st centuries. This article examines the many inspirations that author Ian Fleming and the many screenwriters, producers, and directors had that helped to shape the character of James Bond and the stories of his remarkable adventures. One major inspiration was the British novelist and Intelligence Bureau agent, William Stephenson. Codename \"Intrepid\" during World War II, Stephenson had a knack for operating behind enemy lines and performing daring feats to weaken Nazi forces in Europe. Fascinated by the exploits of Stephenson, author Ian Fleming patterned the character of Bond after the talents and feats of Stephenson. Historical accounts of Stephenson had a profound effect on Fleming, who wove those accounts into the fabric of the novel Casino Royale and subsequent James Bond novels. In addition to William Stephenson, popular spy novels of the era were also influential in the construction of the character and styles of James Bond. During the 1950s and 1960s, popular spy novels include authors such as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and Len Deighton. The style of the Bond stories shifted from their primarily Cold War espionage origins to embrace sheer adventure stories and outlandish “Bond villain” villains, mirroring the popular trend of thrillers during this era. The success of James Bond in the late 1950s and 1960s also coincided with the worldwide popularity of rock and roll. Virtually all of the Bond film scores contain numerous guitars and drums, with occasional use of brass and strings, to give the Bond films a signature sound of their own. Legends of the rock world, including David Bowie and Paul McCartney, have also been featured in many of the Bond films, while singers such as Shirley Bassey, Nancy Sinatra, and Tom Jones continue to be extremely influential in the continuation of the Bond legacy due to the success of their many theme songs. Inspirations for James Bond have also extended to the action-oriented stunts and gadgets seen in many of the films. Novels such as Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea provide an obvious influence for the underwater action sequences of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979). Furthermore, the popularity of science fiction in the mid-to-late 20th century provided endless possibilities for special effects-laden and futuristic adventures like Goldeneye (1995)and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Throughout the characters of James Bond’s many adventures, he has become a global phenomenon, and influence from countless creative and cultural sources from the globe have shaped the character and the stories. As these varied inspirations continue to be combined and explored, James Bond will undoubtedly remain as a thrilling, exciting cornerstone of entertainment culture.",

    " Catstye Cam (from the Old English language cæst þe camm, meaning 'jagged peak') is a mountain in the Cumbrian Mountains of England. Located near the Anglo-Scottish border, its summit is approximately 845 m (2,772 ft) above sea level, making it the sixth-highest summit in the county of Cumbria. The mountain stands on its own without any significant height neighbours, allowing for spectacular views in all directions. From its top there are views of Bowfell, the Langdale Pikes, Great Gable and Sca Fell, as well as the Solway Firth and Northumberland National Park. A road leading to the summit is the basis of a challenging and popular drive for recreational 4x4 drivers. As a result, the mountain was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest in August 2002. The mountain is often climbed from the Startle Tarn valley to the east, where there is a small lake, garden, and parking. It’s possible to follow the stream upwards and take either the east ridge or the south ridge, as both offer reasonably easy access. The south ridge is more popular, as it provides better views over the valley below. The east and south ridge of Catstye Cam are very popular among climbers and hikers alike, providing a challenging climb, with some moderate scrambling and good exposure. The rock on the mountain is mostly sandstone, with some areas of slate and volcanic rock. The mountain can also be accessed from St Sunday Crag, via the ridge path, which runs along Cofa Pike, Nethermost Pike and onwards to Catstye Cam. This route is a bit longer than the direct ascent from the east, but it also offers some of England’s best views. Catstye Cam is an iconic peak in the Cumbrian Mountains, providing fantastic landscapes and stunning views in all directions. Whether you’re looking for a challenge or just want to enjoy breathtaking views, Catstye Cam is the mountain for you!",

    " The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (DCOSP) is an educational voucher program in Washington, D.C., United States, created to give eligible low-income parents the chance to send their children to some of the higher-performing public and private schools in the District. The program was created in 2004 by the U.S. Congress as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and funds are provided to students annually. The program allocates a certain amount of funds to each eligible student and his or her family. Eligibility is based on financial need using the Free and Reduced-Price Meal program application for eligibility for poverty and the student must reside in the District of Columbia. Furthermore, the student must have been enrolled in either a traditional public school or public charter school in the District of Columbia during the prior school year and attend an eligible school within the District. The program allows eligible students to access private schools by providing funds to cover tuition, books, uniforms, and transportation costs. Through the establishment of a voucher system, the program provides an avenue for families to pursue schools that fulfill the educational needs of their children outside of the public and charter school system. The program is administered by the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation, which is funded by the federal government. The Trust Corporation also acts as an intermediary between the D.C. government and the schools, distributing payments for voucher students to the participating schools. In addition to providing students and their families with the chance to attend new schools, the DCOSP also allows the participating schools to offer new educational options. Through the program, certain private schools can become part of the D.C. public school program, expanding the range of educational choices for D.C. students. Since 2004, the DCOSP has served over 6,000 students from the District of Columbia. The program has seen a largely positive response from both students and families, as they have reported positive experiences in regards to their children’s academic and social growth. Studies have also shown that students who use the voucher program have a higher attendance rate and better test scores than their peers at public schools in the District. Despite the generally positive response to the DCOSP, there has been some opposition to the program. Critics have argued that the program drains resources from public schools, effectively “privatizing” the public school system. Furthermore, they contend that the program unfairly advantages families in the District who have the means to pay for private school tuition. In the face of these criticisms, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program continues to serve its purpose: to give eligible students from low-income families in the District a chance to access quality education in an environment that caters to their individual needs. The program has remained an important part of the District of Columbia’s educational landscape since its implementation in 2004.",

    " Nebuchadnezzar II (also known as Nebuchadnezzar the Great; fl. c. 605 BC – c. 562 BC) was one of the most powerful rulers of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (605 BC - 539 BC). He is best known for his construction of the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also succeeded in conquering many of the neighboring kingdoms and imposing Babylonian rule in the conquered lands. Nebuchadnezzar was born around 605 BC, the son of Nabopolassar, a Chaldean rebel who had broken Babylon’s ties with Assyria and declared Babylon a sovereign power. He was a member of the Chaldean dynasty, the last dynasty of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. It is believed that Nebuchadnezzar was born in Babylonia, but his mother’s identity is unknown. Upon his father’s death in 562 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II succeeded as king and immediately set off to conquer lands outside of Babylon. He quickly conquered Syria and Palestine, crushing the Egyptian forces and their leader, Pharaoh Necho II. He also defeated the Neo-Hittite city of Carchemish, the Phoenician city-states of Tyre and Sidon, and the kingdom of Judah. Aside from his military conquests, Nebuchadnezzar is famous for his tremendous building projects and public works. He constructed walls around Babylon and several canals connecting the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. He also erected the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The gardens were reportedly built for his wife, Amastis, who was homesick for her native Median countryside. Nebuchadnezzar II is also remembered for strengthening the Babylonian Empire. He reformed the legal, religious and economic institutions of the empire, improving their efficiency and expanding Babylon into an effective bureaucracy. He also ordered the construction of several important monuments, such as the Ishtar Gate and the Marduk ziggurat. Nebuchadnezzar II is a major figure in the Biblical Book of Daniel, in which he is portrayed as a powerful, but ultimately vulnerable ruler. He is also mentioned in Greek and Roman works and is often referenced in modern works as a symbol of imperial power and hubris.",
    " Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm is an algorithm for computing the shortest path from a given source vertex s to all other vertices in a graph. It is an extension of single-source shortest path algorithms for use on parallel computing architectures. The algorithm begins by assigning each vertex an initial distance from the source. The initial distance for the source is 0, and for all other vertices, the distance is infinity. Each vertex is also assigned a predecessor. The predecessor of the source is null, and of all other vertices is the source. The algorithm then iterates until all of the distances have been updated. The basic version of the algorithm, known as the sequential single-source shortest path algorithm (SSSP), operates in a series of iterations known as rounds. During each round, each vertex v computes its new distance dv. The new distance dv is given by the following equation: dv = min{wd, ds + wv} where wd is the distance of the predecessor vertex d to the source, ds is the distance of the vertex s to the source, and wv is the weight associated with the edge connecting vertex d and vertex v. One drawback of the basic SSSP algorithm is that the speed of the computation depends on the size of the graph, since the entire iteration must take place within a single processor. To speed up the process of computing shortest paths in large graphs, various parallel versions of the SSSP algorithm have been developed. One such version is the 'dynamic backtracking' algorithm, which is a combined MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP approach. This algorithm operates in two phases, a 'reduce' phase and an 'augment' phase. During the reduce phase, the message passing interface is used to communicate the distances of the current vertices in the graph. The augment phase then takes place using OpenMP, to process the newly-received distances. Another parallel version of SSSP is the 'adaptive shortest path' algorithm, which is based on the dynamic programming approach. This algorithm relies on concurrent computations as well as message passing to reduce the time required to compute shortest paths. This algorithm also iterates over a graph, computing the new distances in each iteration. It then uses a set of heuristics to decide which processing cores to utilize, in order to effectively utilize the available resources. Parallel single-source shortest path algorithms provide a way to efficiently and accurately compute the shortest paths in large graphs. They can be used for many applications, such as network routing, transportation optimization, and graph partitioning. As the size and complexity of graphs continues to increase, algorithms such as these will become increasingly important in computing the shortest paths.",

    " The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (Danish: Københavns Brand) was a large city-wide fire in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1795. The fire began on 25 June 1795, between 2 and 3am. It broke out in two separate places within Copenhagen’s city walls, in both Christianshavn and Vesterbro. It is thought that the flames were caused by faulty cookstoves, but no official investigation was ever conducted. Fire engines of the day were inadequate to handle the scale of the blaze, and the wind quickly spread the flames across both districts. By the time the fire was extinguished, it had destroyed 1709 buildings, leaving an area of smouldering rubble with a breadth of 4km in the heart of Copenhagen. Thousands of people were displaced, and while no casualties were reported, some residents who had been too slow to evacuate perished in the flames. In total, the economic impact of the fire included damages estimated at 3.2 million rixdollars, of which 800,000 fell to the state, and the rest to unprotected individuals and corporations. The fire brought about a shift in urban lighting regulations. Streets were to be kept lit from the end of October until the morning of May, greatly reducing instances of fires fuelled by negligence. A new fire brigade was also organized, and funds were put in place to help rebuild the affected areas. In the weeks following the fire, Christian VII and his court decided to visit the ruins of the fire and this marked the beginning of a period of rebuilding and recovery for the city. The rebuilding effort was marked by a number of royal decrees, including one for the rebuilding of churches, with a greater emphasis on fireproof measures. Today, the fire is remembered in several places throughout Copenhagen. A memorial to the victims was erected in 1902 in Israels Plads, while several streets in the area still bear the names of craftsmen who lost their livelihoods in the fire. In addition, an annual procession is held on the anniversary of the fire in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, in which citizens commemorate the event with a candlelight parade. Overall, the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 was a tragedy for the people of Copenhagen and their communities, but it also brought about important changes to Danish city planning, fire regulations and public safety policies. Today, the event is marked with a respect and understanding for the lessons it taught.",
    " The Symplegades, also known as the Clashing Rocks, were a pair of rocks which resided in the middle of the Bosporus which was a narrow strait of water located between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. They were worshiped by the Greek and the Etruscans as divine objects, specifically by the Titan of the winds, Boreas. According to Ancient Greek mythology, the Argo and Jason and the Argonauts had to pass between these rocks during their quest and they were told not to. The Clashing Rocks are first mentioned in Homer's Odyssey, but they are most famously recounted in Apollonius of Rhodes' Jason and the Argonauts. According to the story, when the Argonauts were passing between the islands, the two clashing rocks would come together unexpectedly, leaving a narrow passage through which only an experienced sailor could pass. The Argo was able to pass between the rocks because Hera had enabled a mystical breeze that blew the ship through. The Symplegades were believed to have functioned as a barrier of sorts, acting as a deterrent for ships from entering the Bosporus. For centuries, the rocks were treated with godly reverence and sailors would give offerings to the gods to ask for safe passage. Eventually, the rocks were destroyed by the Greek hero Heracles, who smashed them to allow Jason to pass through without risk of death. Some versions of the story also report that these rocks morphed into two birds of prey that flew away. The Clashing Rocks play an important part in ancient Greek maritime history. In modern days, descendants of the ancient Greeks continue to revere the Symplegades as the symbol of their people's struggle in the face of luck and chance. The modern city of Istanbul still celebrates the rocks' destruction every year with Argonauts folklore festivals and painting competitions.",

    " Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza was a Romanian Prince of the House of Cuza, a major figure in the history of Romanian Nationalism, a central figure in the development of the Modern Romanian State, and a leader of unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859. He first ascended the throne as Prince of Moldavia in 1858, and then Prince of Wallachia in 1859, following the will of the Ottoman Empire. Cuza is credited with laying the foundation for Romania's development as a modern European nation, as well as its character as a nation ruled by law and principle. Cuza initially sought to strengthen Moldavia and Wallachia by introducing sweeping reforms, including modernizing the army and rationalizing taxation, as well as implementing various educational initiatives. He also promoted the construction of a railway line linking the two Principalities, the first in Eastern Europe. Cuza's central political achievement was the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859, which set the stage for the creation of a unitary Romanian State in 1862. Cuza maintained a strong anti-Ottoman stance throughout his rule and was regarded as a strong defender of Romania’s independence. As a result of his support for Romania's independence, he was exiled to France in 1866. Nevertheless, Cuza's legacy has long been celebrated in Romania, both as an important father of Romanian unity, and as a major figure in the struggle for Romania's modernization. In commemoration of Cuza's achievements, he was posthumously named Prince of Romania in 1881 and was venerated as a National Hero. Cuza's reformist zeal left a lasting impression on modern Romania, and he has been honored in history books as one of the most important leaders of the nation in its formative years. A number of monuments and buildings in Romania bear his name, and his portrait is featured on the 50 lei banknote. In addition, a number of features in Romania, such as bridges, roads, parks, and universities, are named after him in recognition of his important role in the development of the modern Romanian state.",
    " The 2014 Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns baseball team represented the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the 2014 NCAA Division I baseball season. It was the 73rd season in the school's baseball history. The team was coached by Tony Robichaux in his twentieth season at Louisiana–Lafayette. The Ragin' Cajuns entered the season as the defending Sun Belt Conference champions, but the season proved to be a disappointing one for the team. The team suffered from inconsistency throughout the season, and struggled to a 29–27 overall record, with a 13–16 mark in conference play. On May 19, the Ragin' Cajuns were eliminated in the Sun Belt tournament, losing to Texas State by a score of 5–4, ending their season. Heading into the 2014 season, the Ragin' Cajuns returned much of their team from the previous season. Senior Caleb Adams was the most productive returnee, hitting .327 with eight home runs and a team-high 44 RBI. Senior Michael Strentz enjoyed a breakout season, hitting .301 in 16 starts. On the mound, junior Carson Baranik led the way with a 3.71 ERA and 5–3 record over 12 starts. The Ragin' Cajuns opened the season with a 7–2 loss to Indiana, in the Mardi Gras Classic at Mobile, Alabama. The season was marked by a series of streaks and slumps; the Cajuns opened the season by losing five of their first seven games, then rebounding to win nine of their next eleven. Conference play began after the conclusion of their non-conference slate, and the team opened with a 4–1 mark in their first five games, but then proceeded to lose five of their next seven games, essentially ending their hopes of winning the Sun Belt regular season title. The team did have some bright spots in the season, earning series wins against Sun Belt rivals South Alabama and Arkansas State, both of whom had been ranked in the national rankings at some point in the season. The team also had multiple impressive pitching performances, teaming up to no-hit Coastal Carolina in February. Unfortunately for the Ragin' Cajuns, however, their inconsistencies throughout the season prevented them from building any consistent momentum on the way to their Sun Belt Tournament elimination. Following the conclusion of the season, senior infielder Ryan Leonards and junior pitcher Carson Baranik were selected in the 2014 MLB draft, but the Ragin' Cajuns saw the most success with their young and talented recruits. Freshmen Trace Rousseau and Dylan Moore, as well as transfer Blake Trahan all had strong debuts with the Ragin' Cajuns and should be key contributors moving forward.",
    " Private Eyes is a song by the American new wave band Hall & Oates. It was released in July 1981 as the lead single from their album Private Eyes, and was the title track. The single hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart on October 17, 1981, becoming the group's third number-one single in the United States. Private Eyes was also included in the group's first greatest hits album, Rock 'n Soul Part 1, which was released in October 1983. The song was written by Daryl Hall and Janna Allen, and produced by Hall & Oates and Neil Kernon. The style of the song gave a nod to the doo-wop genre of the 1950s. The song's use of the word \"Baby\" has been cited as an example of \"baby talk\" in the traditional sense, which generally refers to the singing style of singers like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers during the mid-1950s. There is also an extension of baby talk in the song in the lyric, \"I'm your baby tonight\". The song opens with an a cappella verse that has received some of the most well-known airplay. It features the group vocalizing to a syncopated rhythm, repeating the words \"Private Eyes, they're watching you,\" and allowing the notes to run into each other. Since its release, it has become a popular karaoke song. The music video for \"Private Eyes\" was released in 1981 and was directed by Robert Longo. The video was filmed in black and white and featured Hall & Oates miming to the song in front of a white background. The song has been covered by acts such as the cast of The Simpsons and McDonald's, as well as being remixed by various DJs. It has featured in many films and television shows, including Bridget Jones's Diary, The Simpsons Movie, Gilmore Girls, Glee, Lilo & Stitch, and A Knight's Tale. Private Eyes has continued to remain a staple of Hall & Oates' live performances, having been included in every tour since its release.

    " The Hungarian Ground Forces (Hungarian: Magyar Honvédség) is the land-based branch of the Hungarian Defence Forces, which include the Hungarian Army and the Hungarian Air Force. It is the largest branch of the Defence Forces, with a total strength of around 25,000 personnel. The Hungarian Ground Forces are responsible for the defence of the country's territory and the maintenance of its national security. The Hungarian Ground Forces were formed in 1956, after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. The military initially played a crucial role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which overthrew the Communist-dominated government. The Hungarian Ground Forces were reorganized several times since then, and in 1995, the Code of National Defence was adopted, which further reorganised and modernized the Land Forces. The primary role of the Hungarian Ground Forces is to defend Hungary against any external threats. The main headquarters of the Hungarian Ground Forces is located in Budapest and is responsible for strategic planning, operational coordination, and general management. The headquarters is led by the Chief of the General Staff, who is appointed by the President of Hungary. The Land Forces also maintain an armed reserve force, which is made up of volunteers and professional soldiers. The Land Forces maintain a number of combat divisions and support units, including armoured divisions, artillery battalions, special forces, air-defence units and ceremonial units.

    " The West London Orbital (WLO) is a proposed orbital motorway for West and Northwest London. It is designed to provide an alternative to the congested North Circular Road in the capital and to connect outer London boroughs and the M25 orbital motorway. The West London Orbital project was first proposed by the Greater London Assembly in 2006 and further detailed in the London Plan in 2009. The plan was officially unveiled in 2012, and it recommended that the WLO should run clockwise from junction 4 of the M25 near Heathrow Airport, then travel northwest along the A312, A4127 and A404, and then move southwest along the A4 and A3 to reach junction 13 of the M25 near Staines-upon-Thames. The motorway is intended to link the M25 with some of the most populated areas of West and Northwest London, including Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond. It is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion on the North Circular Road and provide improved access to areas of West London that are currently relatively difficult to get to by road, such as Hounslow and Brent. The WLO is estimated to cost approximately £4 billion and it has been designed in a way that minimises disruption to existing communities and infrastructure. The project is expected to be a public-private partnership, and the Government has discussed the possibility of using private finance to fund the motorway. In February 2019, the Department for Transport requested more information on the WLO to enable them to decide whether to fund the project. The Government has since stated that they are considering the project as part of their wider plans to tackle traffic congestion in the capital, and they have committed to providing a decision on the West London Orbital within the next two years. The West London Orbital project has been widely welcomed by local authorities, who believe that it would improve transport infrastructure in the capital and help to unlock economic growth. There has also been support for the project from local businesses and community groups, who have argued that it would free-up congestion and improve air quality in the capital. Despite this, there has also been some opposition to the project, with critics arguing that the cost of building the motorway is too high and could be used for more important local services such as health and education. Ultimately, the success of the West London Orbital project will rest with the Government's decision on whether to fund it or not. If approved, then work could begin within the next few years, allowing the WLO to become a reality and help to unlock the potential of West London.",

    " The Texas alligator lizard (Gerrhonotus infernalis) is a species of large lizard found in the United States. It is a member of the family Anguidae. This species is endemic to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico and is commonly found in the southern regions of both countries. The Texas alligator lizard is known to be diurnal and is known to hibernate during the winter months. They have thick bodies with a length of 5.5-7.6 inches. They are typically gray or brown in color, with dark blotches and bands on their body. They have scales covering the back and tail, while the ventral side scales are reduced in size. The head is wide and rounded and the tail is thick, almost like an alligator’s. Texas alligator lizards are omnivorous and their diet consists of small invertebrates such as insects, snails, spiders, scorpions, and worms. They will also consume plant matter such as fruits and flowers on occasion. These lizards are found in habitats such as arid deserts, woodlands, and scrublands. They prefer to inhabit areas with appropriate cover such as small rocks, logs or brush piles. They are mostly terrestrial but are known to climb trees of shrubs. As well as foraging for food, Texas alligator lizards use their strong leg muscles to outrun predators. The Texas alligator lizard is listed as a species of least concern. They have no major threats to their population. The primary threat to their population is habitat loss due to urban development. Other potential threats include predation by domestic cats, road mortality, and competition with non-native species. Despite the few threats, the Texas alligator lizard is considered to be a hardy species of lizard. This species provides a vital contribution to the ecosystem. They provide food for larger predators, while also aiding in the dispersal of plant seeds. They also help to control insect populations, as they are voracious predators of both invertebrates and small mammals. Due to the resilience of the species, the Texas alligator lizard is an excellent species for captive breeding. Captive breeding programs help to reintroduce the species into their habitats, which is important for population recovery. Breeding Texas alligator lizards in captivity is a rewarding experience for herpetoculturists, as they are a unique and impressive species. In conclusion, the Texas alligator lizard is a unique species of reptile that plays an important role in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Despite few threats, these lizards are resilient and can be bred in captivity. As such, this species is listed as of least concern and is a vital part of the ecosystem.",

    " Kingsland Bridge is an old road bridge located in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, in the northeast of England. Built in 1878, and designed by local engineers Craven and Mark, it is the oldest surviving bridge in Newcastle and one of the oldest historic road bridges in the North of England. It is a Grade II* Listed Building by Historic England. The bridge crosses the River Tyne between the neighbourhoods of Jesmond and Heaton, east of the city centre, and is positioned slightly north of the Redheugh Bridge. It originally served as a southwards extension of Wingrove Road, carrying the B1351 road, but has since been closed to vehicular traffic. Kingsland Bridge is a two-span, wrought iron and masonry structure, featuring two parabolic arches, each one built with 400 tonnes of Welsh granite. The arches span a distance of 36 metres, creating a total width of 18 metres, rising far above its original foundation. At the end of the 19th century, Kingsland Bridge became a centre of community and leisure activities. A pedestrian pathway was added in the 1920s, which allowed relative freedom of movement until it was closed off to pedestrians again in the early 1990s, due to its increasing dilapidation. Despite its closure, the bridge has slowly been refurbished, in order to preserve it as a historic site. In recent years, a number of facelifts have been applied, including the installation of new lighting, balustrades and fencing, and aesthetic restoration to the masonry. Nowadays, Kingsland Bridge is a popular destination for tourists and local enthusiasts alike. Situated in a scenic area with the River Tyne running directly underneath, many people stop to appreciate its architecture and observe the river's surrounding views. As part of the regeneration project in Newcastle, several initiatives have proposed the opening of the bridge to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. If implemented, these plans could potentially reinvigorate the area and would likely increase the number of visitors to an already unique site.",

    " Trystavisim is a philosophical movement that emphasizes the practice of self-control and mindfulness towards life. The emphasis is on the development of mental and emotional strength in order to better adhere to one’s core moral values. The concept was first introduced by Chinmay Agrawal in February 2019. Fundamentally, Trystavisim is based on the idea that one should strive to live life by only the most valid principles or values that are present in the soul or inner being. By living according to these principles, one is able to reach one’s highest potential on a personal and spiritual level, while maintaining an ethical lifestyle. The root of this pursuit lies in the need to be responsible for one’s actions by understanding oneself, and actively making the determination to adhere and follow through with those core moral beliefs. This understanding and implementation of moral principles for living provides a purpose and strive towards a moral and meaningful life. However, the practice of Trystavisim does not require that all moral values be in full acceptance of one’s self at all times. In fact, the mindfuless of this ideology encourages open communication and self-growth. Instead, it is suggested that one be aware of their own moral convictions, as well as willing to challenge and adapt those beliefs when necessary. Though Trystavisim emphasizes the practice of strong self-control, it also advocates self-care. Self-care is essential in order to maintain an effective lifestyle, enabling one to both be active in their own moral growth, as well as positively contributing to their environment and those around them. The overarching principle of Trystavisim is the importance in living authentically.Striving to be true to one’s own beliefs and moral values is not only vital for personal growth and development, but it is also necessary for developing and maintaining positive and meaningful relationships with everyone encountered in life. In conclusion, Trystavisim can be seen as a practical practice that seeks to embody internal self-discipline and mindfulness while still being able to grow and reach one’s highest potential. None of these components of this ideology are mutually exclusive, as the concept requires that one reconcile the personal, ethical and social aspects of their life in order to live authentically and effectively.",

    " Nikifor Chernigovsky (born 1883 in Serpukhov, Russian Empire - died 1959 in Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR) was a Russian/Ukrainian sculptor and one of the most important figures in Soviet sculpture. He was an influential figure in the development of Russian expressionism in the early 20th century. Chernigovsky studied in Moscow and Beaux-Arts Academy in Paris. After his return to Moscow in 1906, Chernigovsky became a student of the acclaimed sculptor, Pavel Shmele. He developed a style of sculpture heavily influenced by the classicism of antiquity, but with the intensity and movement of expressionism. By 1911, Chernigovsky was displaying his sculptures around Russia. He held numerous solo exhibitions and received numerous awards from prestigious Russian museums and academies. At this time, he also joined The Blue Rose Society, an avant-garde art collective in Moscow. In the 1920s, Chernigovsky was an active member of the Union of Soviet Sculptors. He participated in the decorations for the One Thousand Year Anniversary of Kievan Rus in 1923, and decorated the walls of the All-Union Palace of Soviets in Moscow. He also became chairman of the All-Union Sculpture Committee in 1925. In the 1930s, Chernigovsky was appointed Deputy Chief of the Directorate of Buildings and Monuments. During this period he worked to restore hundreds of monuments around the Soviet Union. He also helped to develop numerous monuments and statues of prominent Soviet figures, including Nikita Khrushchev and Stakhanovites. After World War II, Chernigovsky's sculpting moved away from expressionism and towards a more socialist realist style. He completed many memorials to World War II occupied territories, including the Monument to the Liberated Peoples of Donbass, as well as a series of monuments to the Komsomol and Young Pioneers. Throughout his career, Chernigovsky was a prolific sculptor and sought to encourage young artists in their art. He is remembered today as one of the most important figures in the development of Russian expressionism and a notable contribution to the culture of the Soviet Union.",
    " The Monteregian Hills are located in the Montreal metropolitan area in southern Quebec, Canada. The Monteregian Hills are part of a network of isolated hills that form part of the Appalachian Mountains chain, extending from Maine to Alabama in the United States. The name “Monteregian” is derived from the local populace in the region who commonly referred to the area as “Haut-Montréal” (High Montreal) in the eighteenth century. It was initially used in the nineteenth century to refer to a district within the City of Montreal but gradually came to mean the hilly area surrounding the city. The Monteregian Hills comprise several distinct mountains in the region. These are Mont Royal, Mount Saint-Bruno, Shefford Mountain, Mont Yamaska, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire and Mont Rougemont. Each of these mountains rises several hundred feet above the surrounding city, with Mont Royal and Mount Saint-Bruno reaching heights of over 1,000 feet above sea level. These mountains are composed primarily of limestone, shale, sandstone and basalt. They form part of the Notre Dame Mountains and form the western limit of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The hilly terrain has resulted in the formation of a number of deep valleys and inter-valley ridges throughout the region, giving the hills their characteristic aspect. Apart from providing a picturesque backdrop to the City of Montreal and its surrounding towns, these hills also offer numerous recreational opportunities. Ski-dooing and snowshoeing are popular winter activities on Mont Royal and Mount Saint-Bruno, while summer months bring hiking, climbing and the annual Monteregian Hills Race. The Mont Saint-Hilaire Biosphere Reserve and numerous nature trails, such as the Mount Odanah Trail, provide ample opportunities for nature lovers to explore the natural beauty of the hills.

    " Saccopharynx lavenbergi is a species of deep sea eel, belonging to the family Saccopharyngidae. This species is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and western Pacific oceans, from Sri Lanka to the Philippines, and from southern Japan to the Great Barrier Reef. It is often found near coral reefs, at depths of between 35 and 400 metres. S. lavenbergi has a slender body, with an elongated snout and large eyes. It is silver-gray in colour, and grows to an average length of 7 to 10 cm. It has an upturned mouth and is able to consume items such as jellyfish, squid and small crustaceans. The reproductive biology of S. lavenbergi is poorly known, but it is thought to spawn annually and disperse the eggs into the ocean. Mature adults reach sexual maturity at 4.5 to 5 cm in length. Eggs have been located at depths of 1027 metres. S. lavenbergi is frequently caught as bycatch by various fishing operations, although it has no marketed value. Management measures have been taken to reduce the number of S. lavenbergi caught in fishing nets, such as the use of turtle excluder devices and bycatch mitigation nets. The IUCN has listed S. lavenbergi as Data Deficient, due to inadequate knowledge of the species’ reproductive rate, population trends and threats to its survival. The species is also discussed in the international scientific literature. The research and scholarly studies conducted on S. lavenbergi provide a glimpse into the lives of these deep sea eels.",

    " The Southampton Blitz was the bombing of the English port city of Southampton during World War II by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe). The blitz began on the night of 23 November 1940, and continued for a total of three days and two nights. The attack was part of the Luftwaffe's strategic bombing campaign over Britain, known as the Battle of Britain. This attack was part of a Luftwaffe plan to destroy Britain's war production factories in the major port cities. Southampton was an important strategic target due to its role as a major naval supply base and a centre for aircraft production. In addition, it was an important docking point for the motorized landing craft used in the invasion of Europe. The initial attack on Southampton began with a series of wave raids lasting several hours. German aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, fracturing water mains, and destroying millions of pounds worth of property. On the first day alone, over 800 people were killed and 8,000 properties were destroyed or damaged. In response to the Blitz, the British government established many food ration programs to help the citizens of Southampton cope. On 29 December 1940, the Southampton Blitz Relief Fund was established to compensate those who had lost their homes or businesses. In addition to the monetary contributions from the British government, the citizens of Southampton also launched their own initiatives. The local newspaper, the Southampton Times, ran a campaign for donations. A \"Gift week\" was held in January 1941, during which local churches and businesses encouraged citizens to donate money and goods to their neighbours affected by the bombing. Despite all the efforts of the British government and citizens of Southampton, the casualties resulting from the Blitz were devastating. 1,655 were killed and 2,935 were seriously injured. Additionally, 150,000 people were left homeless. The last significant raid occurred on the night of 3 May 1941, when the Luftwaffe launched a heavy attack on the city. After that night, there were only smaller scale, sporadic raids on Southampton, the bombings of which resulted in comparatively fewer casualties. The effects of the Southampton Blitz have been long felt by the citizens and remain visible even today in the bombed-out buildings and neighbourhoods. However, it is widely acknowledged that the city's response to the attack, both in terms of their aid programs and the spirit of volunteers who pitched in to help, showed great civic duty and commendable resilience.",
    " Birlinn (Old Norse Byrlind, pronounced [byr-lin]; modern Gaelic Beirlinn) was a type of wooden ship in use in Scotland and Ireland during the Middle Ages, from the Early Middle Ages to the late 17th century. The generic term Birlinn encompassed several different types of vessels, including large cargo ships and smaller boats used for raiding, trade, or transport. The birlinn was designed as a large, multi-masted, open decked vessel with a large square rigged sail and oars for navigation in shallow waters. Its design varied between regions and over time, but it was built with a single, central mast and a square sail, a shallow draught, and was able to navigate in shallow waters due to its clinker-built construction style. By the early 16th century, birlinns were primarily made with four masts and were larger than any other wooden ship in Scotland or Ireland. Due to birlinns being constructed on land, instead of in the water, the offshore winds could be used for sails instead of relying on oars. Consequently, birlinns could travel faster and longer distances than other vessels of their age. The names birlinn and beirlinn were also used to refer to an Irish and Hebridean galley, respectively. This type of vessel was of a slightly different construction, with the central mast often being replaced by two masts and an increased sail capacity. These galley-type birlinns were used for warfare and were likely exchanged between the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland and Scotland. They were renowned for their speed and manoeuvrability, which allowed them to outrun any other vessel they encountered. The birlinn featured prominently in medieval stories and literature of the period. It was also used in many archaeological excavations, most of which date back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. For example, a birlinn was recovered in 2010 from Ardnamurchan Bay in Scotland. The vessel, which was likely built between 1150 and 1250, was the oldest ever found and provides valuable information on the design and construction of birlinns during this period. The birlinn has played an important role in the culture of both Scotland and Ireland, and was even used by Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, modern reconstructions are being built of the historic birlinn and can still be found in many parts of the country.

The Goodfellas soundtrack predominantly features rock, jazz and blues recordings by some of the pioneers of the genres. The main title theme “Layla” is the classic, slow blues-tinged rock song initially performed by Derek and the Dominos in 1970. The song was later recorded as an extended acoustic version by Eric Clapton for the soundtrack and contains a classic guitar solo. Behind its slow groove, the song became a background to the life of wiseguy Henry Hill and his journey through the New York mafia. The song earned a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1992. The soundtrack also includes more traditional jazz recordings such as the theme for the character Tommy DeVito (played by Joe Pesci) composed by the big band score of Rascal's “I Got a Woman”. Other selections from the album include songs from Dean Martin, Jimmy Roselli and Bobby Vinton as well as more modern music from The Chiffons, Aretha Franklin and Eric B. & Rakim, which contribute to the mix of eras in the soundtrack.

    " Countess Palatine Dorothea of Simmern (1641 - 1702) was a German noblewoman of the Palatine line House of Simmern and wife of Frederick V of the Palatinate, King of Bohemia. she was born on 27 June 1641 in Heidelberg, a territory of the Electoral Palatinate, as the fifth child of Count Johann VII of Simmern and Elisabeth Juliane of Nassau-Dillenburg. After the death of her father in 1673, her brother, Johann VIII, succeeded him in the County of Simmern. In 1680, Dorothea married Frederick V of the Palatinate, the Winter King of Bohemia. Their marriage was arranged by Dorothea's relative, William III of England, in an effort to strengthen his alliance with the House of Wittelsbach, of which the Palatinate line in Bavaria was a part. During their life together, Dorothea and Frederick were renowned in Europe for their hospitality. An example of this hospitality was the offering of refuge to French Huguenots (Protestant refugees) fleeing persecution from Louis XIV of France in the 1680s. The Palatinate Court was considered to have one of the best court orchestras in Europe of that time, and their musical activities were particularly encouraged by Dorothea. Under her patronage, the Palatinate Court witnessed the emergence of many Baroque composers. The couples' political involvement began in 1685 with the uprising of the Protestant Estates in support of Frederick's claim to the throne of Bohemia. However, their efforts were unsuccessful and their forces were ultimately defeated at the Battle of White Mountain. Frederick and Dorothea's involvement in the Protestant uprising caused them to receive severe criticism from the Habsburgs and Pope Innocent XI, especially after it became known that they had plotted to ally with the French and Italian princes. In the face of this pressure, Frederick and Dorothea were forced to flee their homeland for The Hague in the Dutch Republic in 1690. There, Frederick acted as a representative for his son, Charles Louis. At the Hague, the couple's finances spiralled out of control as they descended into poverty. Frederick V died in 1699, and was succeeded by his son Charles Louis. Dorothea, however, remained in the Netherlands until her death in 1702. She was buried in the Protestant Reformed Church in The Hague. Dorothea of Simmern is remembered as a talented and independent woman who defied convention and was an exemplary patron of the arts. She is an important figure in the history of the Palatinate and is immortalised in the names of the Palatinate Dorothea citizens' association and the Dorothea Dorotheenstadt, the former centre of the Palatinate in Berlin.",

    " Land-sale overage, also known as residuals or the unearned balance, is the amount of money left over after a land sale has been completed. It is the difference between the original purchase price of the land and the amount actually paid. For example, if a parcel of land was purchased for $100,000 and the total amount paid was only $95,000, the $5,000 difference is the land-sale overage. The concept of land-sale overage is most associated with real estate transactions, but can also be applied to other types of land transactions. For instance, a government may set aside a certain amount of land for public access or conservation purposes in exchange for a lower purchase price. In this case, the land-sale overage is the difference between the original purchase price and the reduced amount. Land-sale overage can be the result of a number of different things. It may be the result of a negotiation between the buyer and the seller, or a government providing incentives or subsidies to reduce the asking price of the land. It may also be due to the tax structure of the local area or the availability of various grants and loans. Whatever the cause, land-sale overage can lead to substantial profits for the landowner. One way landowners may use land-sale overage is to buy additional land nearby. If a landowner is able to purchase land at below market value and then use the overage to purchase nearby land, the landowner can often profit significantly. In some cases, the newly purchased land can be sold for a substantially higher price than was paid for the original parcel. This significant increase in value can result in a significant increase in profits for the landowner. Land-sale overage is a topic that has been studied by economists and other researchers. Studies have shown that in areas where land-sale overage is common, the rate of land use has increased and property values have grown significantly. This is because the additional money from the remaining overage has been invested back into the community, resulting in a greater number of infrastructure projects, improved public services, and increased employment opportunities. In conclusion, land-sale overage is an important concept in real estate transactions. It can result in substantial profits for landowners, increased land use and property values, and improved economic activity in local areas. As a result, it is an important factor to consider when purchasing land or participating in a land-sale transaction.",

    " Outlaw is a term used to refer to an individual who lives in a state of disregard for the law. It can also refer to a person or group of persons who have been excluded from the protection of the law. The term can apply to both criminal activity and to civil disobedience that challenges laws or customs. Throughout history, legislation and common usage has categorized people as outlaws for various reasons, including being declared enemies of the state, disregarding customs, or breaking unjust laws. In the early periods of history, outlaws were viewed as criminals who lived beyond the law and had no legal protection or recourse from their actions. In ancient Mesopotamia and the Middle Eastern nations, the term \"outlaw\" was sometimes used to refer to a person under sentence of death for certain crimes. Outlaws were believed to have been barred from seeking redress for grievances, or from attending court or gathering for group activities due to their declaration as enemies of the state. In feudal societies, when kings and other rulers wielded total power and control, the concept of outlawry was used as a tool to control the population. Outlaws were declared enemies of the state and were ceremoniously and forcibly removed from their villages and tribes. They were often branded as criminals, robbers, or thieves and were often subjected to cruel punishments as a way to keep the rest of the population in line. In some cases, particularly during the period of the Wild West, outlaws were seen as folk heroes. These individuals often went against the grain of society and gained notoriety for their exceptional skills, fearlessness, and defiance against tyranny. Today, the term outlaw is still used in certain contexts, such as organized crime or for political dissidents, but has generally come to refer to any individual or group who are considered to be outside of, or rebellious against, the laws of society. In popular culture, the term outlaw has come to also refer to those who flout the law or traditional norms for their own personal gain or sense of justice. Outlaws are typically portrayed as rebels or renegades who challenge the status quo and rebel against the norms of society, or uphold their own individual code of morality or justice.",

    " 'Fără cuvinte' (pronounced Farrow Coo-vin-tay) is a Romanian phrase meaning \"without words.\" It is a phrase used to describe a situation that is too complex or overwhelming to put into words. The phrase captures a kind of experience, or emotion, that is too big and too important to be expressed in words. The phrase is often used when speaking of love, pain, or loss. It can also be used to describe how one feels when faced with an obstacle that cannot be overcome, or a feeling of sudden clarity in understanding a situation. In some cases, the phrase may be used to describe a moment of joy or serenity that cannot be put into words. The phrase was popularized in the early 2000s by the Romanian band Fără cuvinte. The band released several songs and albums that featured the phrase in the lyrics and the title. The band's music explored many of the themes associated with the phrase and helped to spread the phrase's popularity. The phrase has grown to have a wide range of uses in Romania, where it is often used to describe a range of emotions, from intense sorrow to tranquil happiness. It is also often used to describe a sudden feeling of understanding, or when a problem cannot be solved. Outside of Romania, the phrase is not as commonly known and has yet to gain widespread recognition.

    " The Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots occurred from 22–24 August 1992 in the Lichtenhagen district of East Germany's Baltic Sea city of Rostock, and were the most serious civil unrest in East Germany since the 1953 East German Uprising. During the event, a mob of right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis attacked a building complex housing asylum seekers and set parts of it on fire. The events sparked widespread public debate and condemnation in Germany, leading to nationwide protests and criticism of the government's handling of the situation. The riots, described as a \"pogrom\" and \"Kristallnacht\" by some commentators, were triggered by a dispute between German locals and new immigration. Over the previous months, a wave of xenophobia had risen in the Rostock area, due in part to controversial statements about refugees from local politicians. On the afternoon of 22 August, around 200 people, many of them members of the neo-Nazi scene from other parts of Germany, gathered outside the building complex in the Lompower Ring neighborhood of Lichtenhagen. Many shouted racist epithets aimed at foreigners, and soon began throwing stones and other objects at the building. The police, caught unprepared for the mob, stood by as the building was set on fire and damaged, although some of the officers threw stones at the residents. By the evening, the crowd grew to over 1,000 people, and at times blocked firefighters from putting out the blaze, forcing local firefighters to wait for reinforcements from other parts of the state. As the violence continued, an additional 2,400 police and railway police were deployed to the area. In response to the crowd's actions, some 200 to 300 counter-protestors arrived to try to defend the building from the mob. The violence lasted until around midnight on 24 August, when the police regained control of the area after negotiations. Despite the efforts of the police to stop the rioting, more than 200 people were injured and several buildings and cars were set on fire. As a result of the events, the city of Rostock suffered considerable damage to its public image and relations with its immigrant community. In the aftermath of the riots, the government was criticized by both German and international officials for its failure to prevent the violence, while East German authorities were accused of not providing sufficient security to the asylum seekers. In response, both the local and national government pledged to take action to improve the situation. In 1993, the Bundestag passed a package of asylum-law reforms, including measures to speed up asylum procedures and improve the legal protection of asylum seekers, as a result of the protests. In the years that followed, a number of official efforts to address the underlying issues behind the riots have been initiated, including integration policies and forums for dialog between immigrants and local community members. In August 2012, the 20th anniversary of the riots was marked by a memorial service and conferences to commemorate the events and discuss their legacy.",

    " Phacium is a genus of small, single-celled organisms that belong to the Rotosphaeraceae family. These organisms are found in both freshwater and marine environments, and they feed on bacteria and other organic matter. The genus is composed of two species, Phacium marinum and Phacium ventricosum. Phacium marinum is a species of spherical to oval cells that range in size from 3 to 6 microns in diameter. This species is found in marine habitats, particularly neritic and estuarine waters where it is able to attach to other substrates. These cells get their nutrients from a cross-section of bacteria, diatoms and organic material. The cells will often stay in one area if the bacterial substrate is abundant. Phacium ventricosum is a species of irregularly-shaped cells that range from 5 to 10 microns in size. This species is found predominately in fresh water environments where it feeds on a mix of organic matter and bacteria. The cells attach to various substrates in an upright position and will travel within the water using pseudopods. The Phacium genus does not reproduce sexually. Instead, reproduction is asexual through a process called binary fission. This process involves the splitting of the cell wall in the middle, resulting in two identical cells. Phacium has been studied in a variety of research purposes. Scientists have looked at the genus as part of research into the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within bodies of water, as well as in the study of the effects of environmental stressors on microbial life. Due to their abundance in bodies of water, Phacium is a very important part of the microbial food web, and is essential to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, Phacium is a genus of single-celled organisms found in both freshwater and marine habitats. There are two species within the genus, which reproduce asexually through the process of binary fission. These organisms play an important role in the microbial food web and the overall health of aquatic ecosystems.",
    " The Battle of Yongsan (1900) was an important battle of the Korean War which took place during the siege of Yongsan, a strategic port city near the southern end of Incheon Harbor on the west coast of Korea. The battle was fought between Japanese Imperial Army forces under the command of General Uyemon (Miyamoto) Masaharu, and Korean forces commanded by Kim Jwa-jin. The siege of Yongsan began on June 6, 1900, when the Japanese forces attacked the city. The Korean forces, under General Kim, had taken a strong defensive position in the city and were able to repel the Japanese attack with relative ease. However, the Japanese forces eventually managed to break through the Korean defenses and take control of the city. The Korean forces then set up a counter attack, launching a series of surprise raids against the Japanese forces in order to gain an advantage. These raids proved to be successful as they managed to regain several positions in the city. The Battle of Yongsan then transformed into a stalemate, with both sides entrenched in positions around the city. This months-long siege of Yongsan ended with a decisive victory for the Korean forces. On August 9, 1900, the Korean forces launched a surprise attack against the Japanese forces and were able to take the city and force the Japanese to retreat. The victory at Yongsan marked an important turning point in the Korean War, showing that the Korean forces were capable of successfully defending their country against foreign invasion. The Battle of Yongsan was significant as it was the first successful defensive battle fought by the Korean forces. Furthermore, it helped establish the Korean forces as a formidable opponent and as a result showed that Korea was capable of defending itself against foreign aggression. The Battle of Yongsan also had an impact on politics, as it raised the question of international intervention in Korea and the legitimacy of Japanese rule in Korea. In addition, the Battle of Yongsan helped to highlight the importance of Korea’s unique cultural and political identity and furthered the move to establish Korea as a unified and independent nation. Following the battle, a peace agreement was signed between the two sides on August 22, 1900. The Treaty of Taft-Katsura resulted in a ceasefire and an official end to the Korean War. The Battle of Yongsan was an important victory which resulted in the establishment of a unified and independent Korea.",

    " Berzosertib is an investigational medicine in the class of compounds known as ATR Kinase Inhibitors. Its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of ATM-dependent protein kinases, which are involved in DNA damage signalling and the responses to such damage. Berzosertib was developed by Array BioPharma and is undergoing clinical trials as a potential treatment for advanced solid tumor cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Berzosertib is a small-molecule, orally administered therapy with impressive activity in several solid tumor indications, including lung and prostate cancer. It has shown to be well-tolerated and has a good absorption profile. It works to inhibit the enzyme ATR kinase from its active conformation, preventing the signal transduction of DNA damage and triggering downstream DNA repair pathways. In this way, it targets major defense mechanisms of cancer cells and promotes cell death. Berzosertib is currently in Phase II trials for several tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, bladder cancer, biliary tract cancer and gall bladder cancer. Results from the Phase II clinical trials seem to be promising, showing that the combination of berzosertib and chemotherapy was able to reduce tumor size in advanced non-small cell lung cancer capably while being well-tolerated. In patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, berzosertib in combination with androgen deprivation therapy appeared to reduce tumor load in a statistically significant manner when compared to patients who were given androgen deprivation therapy alone. Additionally, results suggest a potential benefit of berzosertib over chemotherapy-based treatments. Berzosertib appears to be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of various solid tumor cancers. Its principal mechanism of action targeting ATR kinase has shown to be effective in killing cancer cells, and the drug is well-tolerated. Thus, Berzosertib may have the potential to become the treatment of choice for many advanced solid tumor cancers in the near future. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate its safety and efficacy beyond the initial phase trials and to determine its utility for other cancer types.",

    " Ekhymosis was a Colombian rock band formed in 1987 by Juanes and Andrés \"Special-K\" García in Medellín. Their musical style is a mix of rock, Latin rhythms and acoustic ballads, which is characteristic of the \"paisa\" culture of Colombia. The band made a great deal of impact with their debut album Si Supieras, released in 1992. The record featured the group's greatest hit, the title track \"Si Supieras\", which is a passionate acoustic rock ballad and remains one of the most influential songs of Colombian rock. The video for the song was also popular, and thrust Ekhymosis into the forefront of the Colombian music scene. The band's follow-up album Dilema, released in 1994, secured their place as one of the best rock bands in Colombia. The album contained hits like \"Baja de Peso\", \"Mientras yo Respire\" and \"De Pie en el Suelo\", and further solidified Ekhymosis' signature style of blending rock, Latin rhythms and acoustic ballads. Due to the somewhat unorthodox structure formed by the need to use a great deal of electricity with the additional complexity of being a Galician-shaped filter, the band had difficulty finding venues in which to perform, especially in Colombia. However, they found popularity in alternative music festivals and produced some incredible concert moments. In 1998, Juanes left the band to pursue a solo career. Ekhymosis continued to work afterwards with the remaining members, but never achieved the same level of popularity. Andres moved to Barcelona and formed a new group, Delta de Ekhymosis, which remained active until 2011. Despite their disbandment, Ekhymosis has remained an influential cult favorite in the alternative music scene in Colombia. Their music has been covered by various bands, including Calle 13, Los Amigos Invisibles, and Ruben Blades. Their influence can also be heard in the music of Latin American alternative musicians including Santana, Juan Luis Guerra, and Manu Chao.",

    " Cienfuegos is a Cuban League baseball club founded in 1922 as one of two teams from the city of Cienfuegos. According to Osvaldo Hernández’s Baseball in Cuba, Cienfuegos were the winners of the 1919 championship, and the team is considered to be one of the oldest and most successful teams in Cuban professional baseball. Cienfuegos were the most successful team in Cuban League history during the period 1934-1952, winning six national championships and three Caribbean Series titles. After the second Cuban team, Industriales, began playing in 1953, Cienfuegos and Industriales began what is widely recognized as the greatest rivalry in Cuban baseball history. Since then the two teams have gone head-to-head over 105 times, with Cienfuegos statistically holding the lead in wins. Aside from their success in the Cuban League, Cienfuegos has been a prominent presence in international competition. The team represented Cuba in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, taking home a Bronze Medal finish, and sent two members to the 1985 Intercontinental Cup in Italy, as members of the Cuban National Team. Cienfuegos underwent significant changes in the 1990s, starting with the 1996-97 baseball season, when the club left the city of Cienfuegos and moved to Havana, becoming a de facto team of the Industriales. This move was simply the result of the collapse of the Cuban economy, which resulted in a lack of finances for the existing teams in the Cuban League. Today Cienfuegos is a part of the Cuban National Series baseball league, playing as a home team located in the Marianao neighborhood of Havana. The team is still referred to as the \"Elefantes de Cienfuegos\" (Elephants of Cienfuegos), and they are still amongst the most successful teams in the Cuban League. The team has won two Cuban League championships (1998-99 and 2006-07) and two Caribbean World Series titles (2009 and 2011). Cienfuegos remains one of the most historic teams in Cuban baseball. Despite several decades of up and down periods, the \"Elefantes\" have always been one of the most successful teams in professional Cuban baseball. Over the years, the club has produced many great players, such as Antonio Muñoz, René Arocha and Orlando Hernández. Thus, Cienfuegos will be remembered as one of the most important teams in Cuban baseball history.",

    " Boneland is an English language novel published in 2003, written by British author Alan Garner. A sequel to his 1968 novella The Owl Service, Boneland blends mythology and rural fantasy in pursuit of an abstract concept, while at the same time exploring the themes of loss and self-discovery. Set in Cheshire, England, where the author's family has lived for many hundreds of years, Boneland is the second book in the Mabinogion Tetralogy, the final book in a quartet of fantasy novels which includes The Owl Service (1967), The Stone Book Quartet (1976), and Strandloper (1996). The novel centers around Colin, a man in his mid-thirties who has been suffering from some form of mental disorder and has been hospitalized for most of his adult life. While in care he experiences brief periods of lucidity, and is able to recall fragments from his seemingly paleolithic past. He is given experimental drugs and through a process of trial and error he is eventually able to remember his name, the fact that he lives in Cheshire, and discovers that his past is inextricably linked with the ancient rituals of a forgotten religion. The narrative continues as Colin attempts to piece together his past and searches for a path to redemption. The book contains references to various forms of folklore and mythology, particularly of the local Cheshire area, as well as frequent mentions of Pagan and Christian cosmology, particularly concerning the four 'elements'. Garner deliberately explores the nature of how the naming of the elements affects not only the narrative, but the reader's experience of the story itself; he states that the title of the novel is another word for 'earth'. Boneland has been well received by critics and readers alike, praised for its imaginative use of language, its explorations of the theme of loss and its sense of power and beauty derived from its rural setting. It has been described as 'exquisite, unique and captivating' with a 'power over the boundaries of life, death and infancy'. The novel has been adapted for the stage, a reading of the play touring the Edinburgh fringe in 2009. A sequel to the novel, set during Colin's childhood, has been announced by Garner. Boneland has been compared to Garner's earlier works, though it has often been seen as a more mature and ambitious. It is a testament to Garner's understanding of English mythology, magic and rural folklore, but also a work of modern fantasy, exploring themes of identity and alienation. It has become a cult classic and its influence on the British fantasy genre is lasting, as it was praised for its evocative nature and use of abstract storytelling.",

The vehicle was designed for use by a small number of crew and was unique in that its armament could be changed from a machine gun to an anti-tank gun. It was primarily used by the British Army and was used in various theatres of war from North Africa, to the Far East. The Austin Armoured Car was developed in 1935 as a response to the expanding and increasingly troublesome polarised global powers of the time. Austin’s first model of armoured car was the AC1, which was equipped with a four-cylinder engine and two water-cooled Vickers machine guns. Soon after, an AC2 and AC2a were produced which featured the latest engines and had a range of effective armour and armament. The AC2 and AC2a were soon succeeded by the Austin MK I and MK II armoured cars. These improved vehicles featured a six-cylinder engine, revised armour and armament as well as modifications to the transmission system. The final version of the Austin Armored Car was the MK III, which had an eight-cylinder engine, increased fuel capacity and a range of anti-tank ammunition. The Austin Armoured Car and its derivatives saw extensive service in World War II and saw action during the North African, Italian and Far Eastern campaigns. The vehicle was even used to help liberate the Falkland Islands during the 1982 Falklands War. The Austin Armoured Car was eventually phased out of active military service in the mid-1960s, but the vehicles continue to be popular among collectors and military history enthusiasts. Modern replicas of the Austin Armored Car are also available for sale and can even be seen at vintage military vehicle shows. The Austin Armoured Car remains one of the most recognizable military vehicles of its era and serve as a reminder of a time of global tension and instability. While no longer serving an active role in international conflicts, the vehicle’s reputation and legacy lives on.",
    " USS Macon (CA-132) was a United States Navy heavy cruiser, the lead ship of her class, built in Philadelphia in the early 1940s. Macon was commissioned in April 1945 and served most of her service life in the Pacific Ocean, seeing action in the Korean War. The Macon, a Baltimore-class heavy cruiser, was constructed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was sponsored by Mrs. Rufus E. Bealle and commissioned on April 10, 1945. Following her shakedown cruise, the Macon duly joined the Pacific Fleet in June 1945. As World War II wound down, the cruiser operated in Japanese waters as part of the occupation force before steaming to the United States in December, reaching the East Coast and decommissioning in March 1946. After a period of inactivity, the Macon recommissioned in February 1951 and headed back to the Pacific, where she operated in the waters off Korea. She provided gunfire support, screened carriers and transports, and conducted sea and air rescue duties until wounded personnel and disabled aircraft limited her operations during December and January 1952. In March, the Macon returned to the United States for repairs and a refit, emerging from drydock in April and operating in the Atlantic until October. In subsequent years, the cruiser often operated in the Mediterranean Sea and off the coast of North Africa. In June 1960, the Macon was reclassified as a guided missile cruiser, while in August she sailed around South America, making port calls in Ecuador, Peru and Chile before she returned to the United States in October. April 1961 saw the Macon dock at Philadelphia to be decommissioned and then prepared for sale to the Spanish Navy, to form the nucleus of their new 'Light Cruiser' squadron. The Macon eventually left the United States in August and reached her destination on the Canary Islands in September. After being re-designated F81 and named Espana, the vessel served in the Spanish fleet until February 1986 when she was stricken and broken up for scrap. USS Macon thus completed a twenty-one year career, distinguished by an impressive array of battles and accolades; she was awarded the National Defense Service Medal with a conflict star for service during the Korean War and the United Nations Korea Medal for the same fine service. In addition, the Macon was awarded the American Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Navy Occupation Medal, the China Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Armed Forces Service Medal. USS Macon stands as an enduring example of the bravery and skill of American naval personnel taken into battle and daringly served her country in a variety of roles until laid to rest in late 1986.",

    " The 1963 Canadian federal election was held on April 8, 1963, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada to the 24th Parliament of Canada. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, had won an increased majority in the 1962 election. For the Liberals, led by Lester B. Pearson, this was their first election with their new leader. Pearson was a former cabinet minister in the Diefenbaker government. He had tried to displace the Prime Minister by using a secret alliance of Opposition members in the House of Commons in December 1961, but failed. The election results would bring about significant changes to Canada's political landscape. The Progressive Conservatives would suffer their worst defeat since their formation in 1867, and the Liberal Party would score its best result since 1945. The long Conservative majority was replaced by a Liberal minority government, followed in 1965 by a new majority government. The campaign focused largely on economics. Prime Minister Diefenbaker was critical of Pearson for proposing to implement mandatory price controls and said that it was the \"most lethal weapon ever seen in economic ammunition.\" The debate over price and wage controls had polarized the two main parties, leaving the other parties relatively unscathed. The campaign had been thrilling for a time, but it ultimately resulted in a slight shift from Conservative to Liberal. The Progressive Conservatives retained a plurality of seats, but lacked a majority. The Liberals increased their seat total, but still finished 72 seats behind the Progressive Conservatives. In the wake of the election, Pearson's Liberal government was faced with a precarious minority. In order to gain the support of other parties, Pearson implemented tax cuts, an expansion of the Canada Pension Plan, as well as the introduction of Medicare. His government also declared Canada's Official Languages Act, making the two official languages of Canada English and French. In 1965, Pearson's government would go on to win a majority in the next election. The result of the election marked a shift away from the conservative politics of Diefenbaker and signaled a centre-left shift in Canadian politics. It was the first time since 1921 that the Liberals had won an election, and would prove to be an important milestone in Canada's modern history.",
    " The Glomar Challenger was one of the largest and most advanced deep-sea drilling ships in the world. It was built in 1973 by the Global Marine Development Corporation, at a cost of almost $350 million (nearly $2.2 billion in today's money). It was designed for drilling in the deepest parts of the ocean, specifically to search for deposits of oil and gas at depths that had not been reached before. It was equipped with an advanced drilling system and an advanced computer-controlled navigation system, that allowed it to locate and accurately position itself at drilling sites that were as much as 8000 meters below the sea surface. The ship was also equipped with advanced seismic surveying equipment and a specialized system for collecting and processing samples of drill cores and other geological samples. The Glomar Challenger was involved in numerous oceanographic and scientific research projects, including topics such as continental drift, animal dispersal routes, climate change, and ocean floor structure. In 1975, it was used to collect samples from the Mariana Trench – the deepest spot in the entire ocean. On June 8th, 1974, the Glomar Challenger set sail on a controversial mission called 'Project Jennifer' – a CIA-Instigated mission to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, in order to gain access to its nuclear secrets. This mission provoked an international controversy, as the ship was accused of violating international law and jeopardizing other oceanographic research projects. In 1976, the Glomar Challenger embarked on an ambitious venture known as the Leg 116 Expedition, where it drilled more than 20 deep-ocean sites and took numerous samples. This included the Famous 'Tasmanides' Shale, a fantastically rich deposit of valuable oil and gas found underneath the Tasmanian Sea. The Glomar Challenger continued to make important scientific contributions throughout the remainder of the 1970s, and into the 1980s. In 1978, it located the wreck of the Titanic, and undertook extensive photographic surveys of the ship’s remains. In 1984, it completed the first comprehensive mapping of the entire ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger was decommissioned in 1986, and it is now part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fleet of research vessels. It continues to be a valuable asset for oceanographic research, and its legacy of pioneering deep-sea exploration will never be forgotten.",

    " Sunday school answer is a term used to describe the answers to Bible-related questions given in a Sunday school class setting. Sunday school classes are a type of religious instruction typically held on Sunday mornings in churches or other religious buildings. The questions posed in these classes can vary greatly, but usually relate to particular Bible stories, scriptures, books of the Bible, or any other Bible-based topic. Answers to these questions are then typically given in a discussion format at the end of the class. In some churches, Sunday school answer sessions are held regularly and are led by an instructor or leader, who poses questions to the group in an effort to foster discussion and learning. Answers to the questions posed are typically given by the instructor, though in some cases they may be provided by the group members themselves. The answers provided in a Sunday school answer session can vary greatly, depending upon the biblical topic in question and the instruction approach taken by the teacher. Generally speaking, answers are intended to explain the meaning and significance of a Bible story or passage, encourage deeper thought and discussion about the passage, and provide practical applications for its application to everyday life. In more modern contexts, Sunday school answer sessions often incorporate technology, such as computers and multimedia, to assist with providing a dynamic learning environment. For instance, online Sunday school answers may be used to provide support to students who may be unable to attend regular class sessions, as well as to encourage e-learning and further exploration into Bible-related topics. Such databases may also feature interactive tools, such as quizzes and challenges, to boost engagement. At the heart of any Sunday school answer session is a desire to understand the Bible and its teachings better. By actively engaging in a discussion format, both teacher and student find opportunity to explore, ask questions, and draw personal spiritual insights and knowledge. This helps foster an atmosphere of learning that is engrained with the values and teachings of the Bible, ultimately providing a place of spiritual growth.",
    " Vien, also known as Vien-Hirsh, is a rabbinical dynasty originating from the city of Luninetz, Belarus. It began in the 16th century with two brothers: Rabbi Hirsh and Rabbi Mordecai. The two brothers were well-known and highly respected within the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. Rabbi Hirsh spent most of his life in Luninetz before settling, at the age of 65, in Przemyśl, Poland. He wrote the work \"Turei Zahav\", a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud. His grandson, Rabbi Moshe Ze'ev of Vien, was a student of Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and wrote the acclaimed commentary \"Luzin\" on the Zohar. Rabbi Mordecai was a renowned Talmudic scholar and the author of several halakhic works, including the \"Mordecai,\" the responsa of \"Pri Mordai,\" and the glosses on the Code of Jewish Law known as \"Mordecai Anshei Shem.\" His great-grandson was Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Vien of Przemyśl, Poland, who wrote the influential \"Ketzos Hashulchan.\" His son was Rabbi Avraham Vien, the author of \"Anshei Avraham\", a commentary on the Arba'ah Turim. Rabbi Avraham Vien's son, Rabbi Yitzchak Vien of Przemyśl, appended the work Magen Avraham, a commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, and authored works including \"Yitzchak Yitzchaki\" and \"Keneis Yitzchak\". Rabbi Yitzchak's sons were Rabbi Naftali Vien of Przemyśl, author of \"Responsa Tzruei Vien\", and Rabbi Shlomo Vien of Grodno, author of \"Mimar Mordecai\", a commentary on the Levush. The Vien rabbinical dynasty played a significant role in Jewish life and scholarship for over four centuries, and its scholarly works are still widely studied today. The Vien rabbis were known for their diligent study and religious zeal, but they also had an eye towards practicality in the application of Jewish law and thought. Today, two of Rabbi Avraham Vien's grandsons, Rabbi Chaim Dov Vien and Rabbi Chaim Yitzchak Vien, continue the Vien dynasty in Jerusalem. The Vien rabbis have been described as a \"golden link in the chain of rabbinical dynasties\" due to their many outstanding accomplishments and contributions to halakhic literature, and to Jewish scholarship more generally.",

    " Schnellbomber (German for \"fast bomber\") was a type of bomber aircraft developed by Nazi Germany in the late 1930s and used during World War II. The term \"Schnellbomber\" was actually not used until after the war, but was initially instead referred to as the Schnellkampfflugzeug, or \"fast combat aircraft\", when the concept was first proposed. The concept behind the Schnellbomber was to create an aircraft that combined the maneuverability of a fighter plane with the payload capacity of a bomber. This was an attempt to keep up with the Allied forces, who had already developed the modern concept of the fighter-bomber. The initial model of Schnellbomber was the Dornier Do 217, a twin-engined long-range bomber unveiled in 1938. Although the Do 217 had a much larger payload capacity than most of its contemporaries, its performance within a combat environment was limited. It was quickly replaced by more capable designs, such as the Junkers Ju 88. The Ju 88, which first flew in 1939, was the most successful Schnellbomber of the war. It was faster, better armed, and had a longer operational range compared to the Do 217, and was used in a variety of roles. It was primarily deployed as a dive bomber, but was also used for ground attack, torpedo bombing, reconnaissance, and as a night fighter. The Ju 88 was instrumental in the Battle of Britain, and over the course of the war, its production exceeded 20,000 aircraft. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190, first produced in 1937, was another early model of Schnellbomber. Initially designed to act as a fighter plane, its development was quickly superseded by the rise of fighter-bombers. As a result, the remaining Fw 190s were used as ground attack bombers and night fighters. By the end of the war, the Schnellbomber concept had largely been abandoned. Although the Nazi German aviation industry had succeeded in creating powerful aircraft, the production and fuel shortages of the war meant that the majority were never fielded in significant numbers. In addition, the advent of jets, which were faster, better armed, and easier to produce, meant that propeller-driven bombers were quickly outclassed. Today, the Schnellbomber concept has been mostly forgotten, but its legacy still lives on in the development and concept of modern fighter-bombers. Examples include the Northrop F-5 Tiger, F/A-18 Hornet, and the A-10 Thunderbolt II. While Schnellbombers never delivered on their promise to revolutionize air warfare, they laid the groundwork for the development of highly advanced fighter-bombers.",

    " Slavink (also known as fricadel, frikandel, frikkadel or Dutch frikadel) is a Dutch meat product, very similar to a hot dog, which is made from a combination of pig, beef and sometimes poultry meat. It is a pocket-sized meat product served in pairs, usually between buns.

    " Fourth Fitna, also known as The Revolt of Ibn al-Zubayr, began in 683 CE and ended in 692 CE in the Arabian Peninsula. The conflict resulted from the succession crisis of the Umayyad Dynasty which ruled the Islamic Caliphate at the time. It was the final civil war in a series of three civil wars known as the Fitnas – a time of political and religious turmoil in Islamic history. It was also the most destructive of these wars. The conflict had its roots in a dispute between the Saffarids, who were Shi’i Muslims, and the Umayyads, who were Sunnis. The Saffarids sought to overthrow the Umayyads in order to create a Shi’i Muslim caliphate. To achieve this, they invited the renowned scholar and warlord, Ibn al-Zubayr, to lead their cause. Ibn al-Zubayr was a descendent of Banu Umayya, the clan from which the Umayyads had descended, and was also a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Because of his background, he had significant legitimacy to claim the caliphate. In683 CE, Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and declared war on the Umayyads. He was able to gain the support of the Saffarids, as well as other Shi’i Muslims in the area. The Umayyads responded by sending a large army to confront Ibn al-Zubayr. The Fourth Fitna was devastating; entire cities were destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people were killed. It lasted for nine years and did not end until the Umayyad army was finally able to defeat Ibn al-Zubayr in 692. This marked the end of the Fitnas and the Umayyads continued to rule the Islamic Caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids in 750. The legacy of the Fourth Fitna is one of destruction and death. The conflict revealed bitter rivalries between different Muslim sects and severely weakened the Umayyad Dynasty, ultimately resulting in its demise. It also showed the dominance of tribal affiliations in the politics of the time, which would continue to shape the history of the Middle East for centuries.",

    " The 2008 riot in Mongolia began as a protest on June 25, 2008 in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. This mass protest was sparked by an announcement made by the Mongolian Government to demolish the legal and illegal dwellings and shops located around Sukhbaatar Square. This announcement by the Mongolian Government was to make way for a new commercial and residential project near the city's center. The protest began peacefully, but eventually evolved into a riot. Protesters clashed with the Mongolian police, and some protesters threw stones at the police and set fire to public buses. The rioters then spread to other parts of the city, targeting officials, banks, and symbols of government, including government buildings and the Mongolian Stock Exchange. In response, the Mongolian police used tear gas and water cannons to try and disperse the crowd. The rioting went on until the morning of June 26, when the Mongolian Government declared an emergency, sending 1,000 troops to the capital to help restore order. The riot resulted in over 1,000 arrests and more than 100 injuries among both protesters and police officers. The Mongolian government condemned the riot and labelled it an \"attempt to destabilize the country.\" It was determined that government negligence and inadequate planning of the urban development project sparked the riot and fueled the discontent of citizens. The government set up a commission to investigate the incident, and the Mongolian Parliament eventually passed legislation to provide aid to those impacted by the demolition. In 2009, the Mongolian president offered an apology to those affected by the eviction. The 2008 riot in Mongolia was a major event in the country's history, and it serves as an important reminder of the need to consider public opinion and individual rights when governing a country.",

    " \"The Sound of Missing You\" is a single recorded by American singer and songwriter Kelly Clarkson. It was released in the year 2021. The track written and composed by singer-songwriter John Brett, with production and vocal recording by Grammy Award-winning producer Scott Pagano. Clarkson’s vocals were recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, TN. \"The Sound of Missing You\" receives lyrical inspiration from the yearning desire and longing for a lost lover. The track navigates feelings of nostalgia for a past love as well as its sense of absence. Through the lyrics, Clarkson expresses her own story of a “foreboding heartbreak” and grief of being disconnected from someone from the past. The track incorporates a combination of crisp acoustic guitar and soft synthesizers to achieve a dreamlike, intimate atmosphere. The overall sound reflects a desire for closure and allowing the past to exist in both physical and emotional space. The accompanying music video for \"The Sound of Missing You\" was released on the same day as the single. Directed by Kirsten Lepore, the video features a surrealist concept that emphasizes the watery sounds and visuals of the track itself. The video follows Clarkson as she moves through various imperfectly composed dreamscapes, as she grieves the absence of a past love and reflects on the mixture of emotions. The track has received universal acclaim. Critics praised the production and clever use of imagery in the visuals to illustrate the track’s themes of past longing and distance. Clarkson’s strong vocal delivery and emotionally charged performance were also praised.

    " NGC 3175 is an open cluster of stars located in the constellation of Sextans. It was discovered on April 26, 1793 by German astronomer William Herschel. NGC 3175 has an apparent magnitude of 10.8 and its distance from Earth is estimated to be about 12,400 light years. The stars in NGC 3175 are organized into a sparse grouping and are spread over an area of 10 arc minutes in the sky. The stars of the cluster range in spectral type from F through G to M, with the majority being late-type stars. In addition to its open cluster stars, NGC 3175 also contains several Herbig–Haro objects. These are formed when material such as gas and dust travelling away from a young star in jets gets slowed down and compressed by the interstellar medium, forming knots and nebulae. Most of the Herbig–Haro objects that have been detected in NGC 3175 are located near the southern edge of the cluster. Most of the stars in NGC 3175 are young, with a median age estimated to be about 6.8 million years. This indicates that the cluster is a relatively young star-formation region. The estimated total mass of the cluster is about 3000 times that of the Sun, with the brightest stars being about 10th magnitude. NGC 3175 is visible with a relatively small telescope, or even binoculars, in a dark sky. It is best viewed in March and April, and can be found within 5 degrees of the planet Uranus, and just over 6 degrees west of the bright star Spica. Despite its relatively close distance to Earth, and its relatively young age, only a few stars in NGC 3175 have been studied in any detail. In particular, the star HD 86134 has been found to be a red giant, and several others have been identified as binary stars. In addition, some stars in NGC 3175 display evidence of rapid rotation, which may be the result of close flybys of neighbouring stars. Due to its relative youth, NGC 3175 may be of particular interest to those studying star formation. A better understanding of the cluster, in particular its Herbig–Haro objects, may provide new insight into how stars form and interact with their surroundings.",

    " The Sisters of the Infant Jesus (S.I.J.) are a Roman Catholic religious congregation of women founded in 1673 in France by Father Pierre Lambert de la Motte. It is a monastic institute of pontifical law, or a Third Order Regular. The institute was founded for the purpose of educating the young and educating the poor. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus have served in a variety of settings, including parochial schools, hospitals, orphanages, colleges, and homes for those with physical and mental disabilities. Today, the worldwide congregation has over 1,500 members in 75 countries. The rule of life adapted by the original founders was composed by Father Lambert and Sister Jeanne de Beuzy, who both dedicated themselves to the service of the poor and young. This Rule prescribed a distinct spirituality which focused on duty and service, the internal life of prayer, self-denial, manual labor, and the union of the life of each sister to that of Our Lord Jesus Christ and His Blessed Mother Mary. The congregation has suffered three suppressions during its history, yet has managed to regain its status as a religious institute. Before his death in 1690, Father Lambert was able to renew this suppression in 1681, with the approval of Pope Innocent XI; he had done the same in 1683 and 1697. The congregation was thus able to continue its work of Christian formation, education, and aid to the poor and needy. The Sisters of the Infant Jesus opened more than 70 foundations in France, Belgium, England, Scotland, India, Mexico, and South America. Their work expanded to include work in diocesan colleges, parishes, hospitals, homes for the aged and handicapped, care for disturbed youth, homes for single mothers and homeless women, and various other forms of outreach. In 1962, the sisters opened their first American foundation in Nebraska, USA. This expanded to include facilities in other states, and today there are over 30 American communities. They work in a variety of capacities in the youth ministry, care for the aged, health care and education, and outreach to serve the needs of those who are poor and vulnerable. The sisters continue to live according to their charisms of the love of God and the love of neighbor and seek to spread this same love to all they serve.",

The group’s debut album, Buy (1978), is still considered one of the most innovative and influential albums in punk history. Harris also recorded two solo albums during his time with The Contortions: Need for Not (1980), and Escape Artist (1981). Both albums were critically acclaimed and showcased Harris’s talent as a forward-thinking musician and innovative songwriter. After leaving The Contortions in 1982, Harris moved to New York City and became an integral part of the city’s No Wave scene. He joined legendary experimentalists Material and founded the avant-rock collective 8-Eyed Spy. The two groups blended a variety of genres into a wild, mostly instrumental mixture of hard rock, electronic funk and free jazz. In 1985, Harris recorded his third solo album, Big Apple Heartbeat, an unconventional mix of raw industrial percussion and art-punk. Harris’s involvement in the music scene shifted in 1987 when he became a Fulbright Scholar at the Institute of Sonology in the Netherlands. There, he realized the potential of advanced technology and computers to radically manipulate sound. In the late 1980s and early ‘90s, Harris extensively explored the boundaries of electro-acoustic music, computer and video art. Now living in upstate New York, Harris continues his work as a musician, technician, producer and composer. During the 2000s, he returned to more song-based works, creating a large body of solo work that is entirely his own. His current projects include Escapades, an album of intricate, sophisticated and infectious crossover rock. Today, Harris is universally recognized as an instrumental pioneer in the realms of avant-rock, punk and experimental music. He remains an active and respected figure on the music scene, and one of the key musical visionaries of the past four decades.",
    " John Marlay (d. 1790) was a British lawyer and politician who served in Parliament from 1768 to 1790. Born in Yorkshire, England, Marlay studied at Cambridge University before entering into law in London as an attorney-at-law. Marlay was a noted speaker in the House of Commons and was an important figure during the debates leading up to the American Revolution. Marlay served two terms as a Member of Parliament for Droitwich. During his first term, Marlay was an advocate of taxation reform, which was unpopular with British Colonists in the American colonies. He famously argued for more equitable taxation between Britain and its colonies. When the American Revolution began in 1776, Marlay argued in favor of a peaceful settlement and proposed reforms to the Crown's relationship with its American colonies. However, his colleagues disagreed, and he refused to support war. As the war wore on, Marlay proposed several reforms to Parliament that sought to bring attention to the grievances of the colonists in an attempt to avert further violence. In 1782, he introduced the Peace of Conciliation Bill, a legislative resolution to the conflict, which was not accepted. Later that same year, he proposed a compromise to the impasse, but it was not approved by Parliament. Towards the end of his life, Marlay was appointed as the chairman of a committee to investigate the situation in the former colonies. He advocated for a lenient approach to reviving and restoring much of the original American government and the rights of the colonists. Marlay passed away in 1790, but his legacy remains to this day. He was an early adopter of the concept of a unified government supporting the rights of its citizens, which he saw as one of the most important qualities of a successful nation. He was an essential figure in the early evolution of British colonial policy and is remembered for his efforts to protect the rights of American colonists.",
    " Adjumani District is located in the West Nile sub-region of Northern Uganda, near the International borders of both South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is part of the larger Gulu district. It is the second most populous district in West Nile, with a population estimated at 133,319 inhabitants in 2016. The district was initially known as Amidu District but was renamed Adjumani District in 2001. It is divided into eight sub-counties that range from mountains to lowlands, making it one of the most diverse districts in terms of climate and topography. Economically, Adjumani is one of the poorest districts in Uganda. It is classified as a rural district, and despite numerous initiatives over the years, poverty levels remain high. The major sources of income are fishing and small-scale farming, though the latter is limited due to the poor infrastructure in the area. Adjumani is home to a variety of ethnic groups, notably the Kakwa, Lugbara, and Madi. The Kakwa, Lugbara and Madi are among the many language groups found in this district, the others being Acholi, Langipiri, Lope and Boro. Education is another major challenge in the district. Most schools are overcrowded and lack basic facilities, and teachers are often not properly trained. As result, the district is lagging behind in educational standards compared to other districts in Uganda. Adjumani District is known for its dramatic landscapes, as well as its wildlife, which includes the Congo peafowl and the African buffalo. In spite of its many challenges, Adjumani is a great place to explore and appreciate the richness of Northern Uganda’s culture and natural beauty.",

    " White face is an act of painting an individual's face or body with a white substance, intended to create a blank or featureless facial or body expression. It is commonly used in theater, dance, mime, and other performance art genres such as clowning, street performance, and drag performance. Although white face is typically used to express uniformity and to emphasize the performer's eyes, mouth, and other facial features, some people also use white face to make a political or cultural statement. White face is a popular performance art dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. During these time periods, the white face was used to convey gender roles, with men wearing white make up to appear more masculine and women wearing it to appear more feminine. Some notable figures from the Theatre of Ancient Greece such as Thespis and Aeschylus also used white face as a means to convey expression, as noted in historical accounts such as the writings of Aristophanes. In the 20th century, theater groups such as the Moscow Art Theatre, founded by Konstantin Stanislavski and Viakislav Meyerhold, popularized the usage of white face. The two directors believed that performances were enhanced when the actor was able to convey emotion and expression through subtle shifts in facial expression, gesture, and vocal delivery. Today, white face is commonly used in theatre, dance, mime and other contemporary performance art genres. Professional clowns, street performers, and drag performers may also incorporate white face into their act. White face is usually paired with theatrical makeup in order to express an emotion or message. In many places, white face is discouraged due to its history of being associated with racism and White supremacy. Supporters of cultural appropriation argue that white face is an artistic form used to express emotions or ideas that should not be suppressed. Conversely, opponents of such appropriation argue that performers should not be able to appropriate a culture by using elements that are historically or traditionally associated with a culture they don't belong to. In most contemporary performance art, white face should not be used without permission, either from an audience or the performers themselves. Regardless of views on cultural appropriation, white face is a centuries old form of theatre that still has the potential to make powerful statements and elicit powerful emotions from audiences.",

    " Nadir Ali Khan (1955-2003) was a Pakistani-American writer, poet, and artist. He was born in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan and later moved to Los Angeles, California. He was best known for his books, The Horizon of Hope and Timeless Shadows, which were semi-autobiographical works exploring the challenges of living in two vastly different cultures.

This timeline outlines some of the major events that occurred during this important century of Muslim history. 900 A.D.: Muslim armies, led by the general Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād, capture the city of Córdoba in present-day Spain. This marks the start of the Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula, which would last for several centuries. 902 A.D.: The Fatimid dynasty is established in Tunisia, Algeria and later Egypt. This dynasty would go on to become one of the major Islamic powers of the age and its capital, Cairo, would become a major cultural and intellectual center. 905 A.D.: Al-Shawkani, a famous Muslim jurist, publishes the first volume of his book, Badāʾiʿ al-Sināʿatayn (The Unique Miracle), setting the foundation for Islamic jurisprudence in the 10th century. 905–925 A.D.: The Buyid dynasty, founded by brothers Ahmad and Shirdawy, establishes its rule in present-day Iraq, Iran, Syria and parts of Central Asia.

    " Puelche language, also known as Pehuenche, is an extinct language that was spoken by the Huilliche individuals of southern Chile and Argentina. The language was mainly spoken by individuals living in the northern part of Patagonia on the Chile-Argentina border and had no written form. The Puelche language was first discovered by Spanish and Portuguese loanwordz by Jesuit priest Bernardino Gil y Taboada in 1797 and the language was subsequently studied by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The language is related to the languages of the Chon, Tehuelche, Teushen and Chonan individuals who share a few linguistic commonalities as demonstrated by Georgy Charinov in 1970. In some cases, words from the Puelche language were adopted into Chilean Spanish, such as the word puelche itself which refers to clothes or something from the north. The Puelche language is a polysynthetic language, meaning words are often composed of multiple numerous components. It also makes use of unique systems of voice and mood to indicate the speaker's attitude. Furthermore, Puelche has a large number of particle words which have been used to refer to specific aspects of life and culture such as games, animals, and plants. Though Puelche is now extinct, its influence can be found in the languages of Mapuche and Araucanian. Though the Puelche language number of speakers has decreased significantly since the 19th century, there are still a few speakers in some communities in Northern Chubut and Río Negro, Argentina. There is still a lack of literature and research related to Puelche, which is why it is often referred to as a “lost” language. Puelche has important historical-cultural relevance in the region. It serves as a bridge between the indigenous Huilliche culture and the Mapuche culture, connecting them to the Southern Cone region. Moreover, it is used to gain insight into the cultures, modes of thinking and traditions of the Huilliche, which can inform modern day cultural practices. Further research about Puelche is necessary to accurately document the lives, customs and history of these individuals. Though the language is now extinct, it will continue to live on through the history and legacy of the Huilliche and their descendants. There is still much that can be learned from the study of Puelche, and the language holds an important place in the larger cultural mosaic of Argentina and Chile that cannot be forgotten.",

    ". How Starbucks Saved My Life is the true story of an anonymous author, an entrepreneur and consultant, who was in a deep depression until the discovery of hope in one of the most unusual of places - a Starbucks. At the lowest point in his life, the man found himself lying in the dirt under a tree with no food for three days, believing he was doomed to spend the remainder of his life as a homeless person. One afternoon, he stumbled upon a Starbucks in a nearby town. Although he was desperately hungry, he gathered enough courage to take a seat inside. After a few moments of rest and reflection, the man was noticed by a barista. The barista asked him how he was doing, and this small act of kindness meant the world to the man. The barista shared stories of hope that the man found inspiring, and he felt a drive to keep going. He left Starbucks feeling joyful, and with hope that one day he would make something of himself. Fast forward fifteen years, and the man is now seen as a successful entrepreneur and consultant working in multiple industries. His success was incredibly unexpected, and a direct result of the stranger's kindness - kindness that he received at Starbucks. Since then, he has returned to Starbucks often, not only to thank the staff, but also to offer words of encouragement to those who may be struggling in life. As highlighted in his story, Starbucks can be a safe place for anyone feeling low and lonely.

    " Caravan (novel) is a science fiction novel written by British author A. E. van Vogt and published in 1950 by Simon and Schuster. The novel is set in a post-apocalyptic future on Earth where mankind has been reduced to a few hundred thousand survivors. The story follows two groups of survivors who embark on a journey across a radioactive wasteland—the Caravaners—as they search for knowledge, hope and a new home. The novel is set in the distant future, after Earth has been ravaged by nuclear war. An epidemic called the ‘Plague of Madness’ has wiped out all but a few hundred thousand humans who are now scattered across the world. The novel’s protagonists are members of the Van Rijn family, a group of Dutch traders who have come together to form a caravan that is journeying eastward across the radioactive wasteland in search of a new place to call home. Led by their captain, Moses Van Rijn, the caravaners must contend with hordes of animal-like mutants while simultaneously keeping a wary eye out for the mysterious alien race called the Greys, who are known to abduct survivors. Along their journey, the caravaners meet up with a variety of characters, such as the unscrupulous trader named Hardin who promises safety and expertise in exchange for a share of their goods; the scientist Hyland who works to uncover the secrets of the Greys; and the corrupted deviant named Abner, who will either save or doom them all. The novel is an exploration of the effects of humanity’s destruction and features several essential themes, such as the duality of human nature and the notion of survival of the fittest. The story is full of danger, mystery and a hint of allegory, making it an enjoyable read for both fans of the genre and those looking for a fascinating glimpse into a possible future. Though not as renowned as some of Van Vogt’s other works, Caravan is still considered to be a classic example of early science fiction and has been cited as an influence on works such as the Mad Max films. The novel has also been included in a variety of collections, such as the SF Masterworks series, and was adapted into a comic book series in 2014 by Boom! Studios.",
    " The Larklight trilogy is a series of science-fiction novels by British author Philip Reeve. The series consists of three books, Larklight (2006), Starcross (2007), and Mothstorm (2008). All three books were published to moderate success and are praised for their inventive and imaginative plotlines. The series follows Art and Myrtle Mumby, two children of an eccentric scientist who live in an alternate version of Victorian England. The siblings live with their father in a sprawling, dilapidated mansion called Larklight, located on the moon and in wild space. The trilogy follows their adventures as they, with their own eccentricities and cleverness, explore outer space and fight off the villainous forces of alien species such as the spider-like Spirelanders, the murderous Osirans, and the sinister Crawl. The books are lighthearted in tone and intended for readers aged 10 or above. However, the books have been praised for their complexity and their thoughtful and mature themes, such as loyalty, courage, family, and responsibility. The books are often compared to the works of Jules Verne and Jack London, and have elements of Steampunk, Victorian-era humour, fantastical upgrades of everyday technology, and a unique blend of realism and fantasy. In 2006, Larklight was shortlisted for the Nestlé Children's Book Prize and won the 2006 Emirates Airlines Festival of Literature's Best Children's Series Award while Starcross was nominated for the 2008 Nestle Children's Book Prize and the 2008 Golden Duck Award. In May 2017, it was announced that Elton John's Rocket Pictures had optioned the rights to the trilogy and was developing a live-action movie of the series, with Elton John himself serving as executive producer. A potential release date has yet to be announced. The Larklight trilogy is a beloved book series by traditional science-fiction fans and children alike. Reeve's creative and intricate world building and well-developed characters bridge the gap between children and adult literature, making the series a unique gem of the genre. ",
    " Ptolemais in Phoenicia (also known as Akko or Accho, from the Hebrew name \"Akkō\") was an Ancient Hellenistic city-state located in the northern coastal region of the eastern Mediterranean in present-day northern Israel. Ptolemais was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy I of Egypt. It was originally commissioned as a naval port and trading post between Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia, and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean region. Ptolemy established it as the first city of his Egyptian-Phoenician empire, which he named after himself as \"Ptolemais\". During its heyday, Ptolemais was a bustling port and commercial center. The city was destroyed by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, but was soon rebuilt by the Ptolemies. It remained an important trading port into the Hellenistic and Roman eras, though it eventually lost much of its significance with the fall of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The city remained largely intact until its destruction by a Crusader army in 1291, after which it lay in ruins until being rediscovered in the 18th century. Over the centuries, it has been occupied in turn by the Mamluks, the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, the State of Israel and Palestinian militants in the Arab-Israeli War. Today, Ptolemais is a walled city that retains its ancient charm despite the modern changes it has undergone since its founding. It is a popular tourist destination due to its historical sites, including the fortifications, an ancient Maritime museum, and an archaeological excavation site. Most of the original city has been preserved and restored and is open to visitors. It has become a major center of culture, education, and industry in the region, with a major port, an international airport, numerous museums, galleries, and cultural centers, and a thriving economy.",

    " Wulfsige of Sherborne was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop based in the area of Sherborne, England. He was active during the early part of the 10th century, and is best known for being the first Bishop of Sherborne. Little is known about Wulfsige's life before he was consecrated as bishop at the royal court of King Athelstan. He is said to have been a royal chaplain prior to becoming a bishop. It is likely that Wulfsige was born in the kingdom of Wessex, as he subscribed acts of King Athelstan and King Edmund in the region. As bishop, Wulfsige founded the Cathedral of Sherborne in 909. He also established a monastic community in the area, built a palace and introduced a new system of laws and regulations to govern the area. Under Wulfsige's rule, Sherborne grew to become one of the most important centers of Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England. He was known to have maintained close ties with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and was a supporter of the Carolingian dynasty. He was also a close advisor to King Athelstan, and is believed to have been instrumental in the king's decisions during his reign. By 920, Wulfsige had retired as Bishop of Sherborne, due to ill health. He died soon after and was buried in the area in a tomb that he himself had constructed. He was succeeded by fellow bishop Æthelnoth, who continued his works in Sherborne. Wulfsige of Sherborne is largely known for his establishment of the Cathedral of Sherborne, which is still standing today. His work greatly contributed to the growth of Christianity in the area and helped to shape the later leading role played by Sherborne in English Christian history.",
    " Ranjana script (Nepal Bhasa/NepalBraj: रञ्जन लिपि), is an abugida (alphasyllabary) script used in Nepal to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit. It was the official script of Nepal during the Malla dynasty and remains in use to the present day for writing Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit. The Ranjana script is believed to have been derived from the Siddham script and Proto-Bengali script. As evident from scattered inscriptions unearthed in Nepal, the script appeared in the 10th century C.E. and quickly replaced several other scripts used in Nepal at the time, such as the Pranava or Sarada script. The script is written from left to right, with horizontal lines extending across the page. Each line has a maximum of five characters and each character consists of either one or two syllables. Upto 22 vowel markers are used to represent the vowels and each consonant is represented by a single syllable. The script uses various ligature styles, such as writing the vowels on top of the characters to represent the consonants. In Nepal, Ranjana is used as a decorative script for religious purposes. It is used for traditional manjusa, a head ornament worn by women, and Newari jewellery. The script is also used for writing in palm-leaves for books, and for generating the Tibetan-style thangkas which are the religious scroll paintings of Nepal. Ranjana is primarily used in the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding areas of Central and Eastern Nepal, as well as other parts of the country. It is not commonly used in the western and mid-western Narayani, Lumbini, and Rapti zones. In recent years, an increased interest in the Ranjana script has led to the revival of the script. As part of this revival, efforts are being made to preserve the script and promote its use. The script was adopted as the official script of Nepal in 2018 and efforts are underway to have it recognized by the United Nations. As of 2019, there are over 25 recognized Ranjana script groups in Nepal, with a significant increase in the number of individuals who can read and write in the script. There are also several online tutorials and apps available to help people learn the script. Ranjana remains an important part of Nepali culture and is still used today to preserve the culture and traditions of Nepal. It is a script steeped in history and is an important part of the cultural heritage of the country.",

Formed in 1993, the quartet consists of founding members Jase \"The Sandman\" Stanley on guitar and vocals, Matthew \"Moecker\" Hirschhorn on bass and vocals, Chris \"T-Bone\" Redmun on drums and vocals, and Clay \"Triggerfish\" Shaley on guitar and vocals. The Linus Pauling Quartet's style spans many genres within the rock and metal spectrum. With influences ranging from classic heavy metal, punk, and stoner rock, the Quartet employs an often industrial sound characterized by relentlessly pounding rhythms, pummeling riffs, cutting solos, and alternately melodic and gruff vocals. The band often makes sly reference to sci-fi, horror and 70s sitcoms in their lyrics. Having released five albums, countless singles, and countless compilation submissions, The Linus Pauling Quartet have remained a rather mysterious entity, having forged a name for themselves largely due to relentless touring and strong independent record sales over the past decade and a half. Though located in Houston, Texas, the band has played extensively throughout the United States, Mexico, and Japan, while also making frequent appearances at South by Southwest and other prestigious music festivals. The band became widely known for their participation in the 2009 Vans Warped Tour, and the subsequent release of the live compilation \"Live Freaks Jams\", which featured performances recorded during the tour. The band was described by the press as having “shredded their way around the country with a unique blend of ‘70s-era classic rock, punk, and metal.” The group's fifth album \"Amps, Axes and Automobiles\" was released on Evilegend Records in 2013. Described as a \"crunchy and powerful recording that suggests the influence of Blue Oyster Cult, Black Sabbath, Grand Funk and Rush\", the album features heavy riffs, driving rhythms, and punk-inspired hooks, further solidifying the Linus Pauling Quartet as one of the most influential American Heavy Metal bands of their generation. The Linus Pauling Quartet continues to make regular appearances around the country and abroad, playing massive clubs and festivals alike, while also developing new material. ",
    " Sydney lockout laws, commonly referred to as Sydney's lockout laws, are a set of laws implemented in 2014 in response to alcohol-fuelled violence in the city of Sydney, Australia. The primary purpose of the lockout laws was to reduce the amount of alcohol-fuelled violence in the city by imposing restrictions on venues and the movement of patrons outside of them. The move was seen as a response to a number of high-profile incidents, such as the death of Daniel Christie in 2013 and the brawl between rival fans at a Major League Soccer game in 2008. The laws restrict patrons from entering alcohol-serving venues in the Sydney central business district and Kings Cross after 1:30am and constrain the sale and sale of alcoholic beverages until 3:00am. Venues must also prevent patrons from re-entering after their first entry. Furthermore, evidence of having drunk alcohol elsewhere is not permitted in any of these venues. Since the lockout laws were put in place, levels of alcohol-fuelled violence in the affected areas have decreased dramatically. In the six months after the implementation of the lockouts, violent incidents were reduced by 24%, including a 43% reduction in hospital admissions for serious head-injuries. However, there has been significant backlash from the industry and public due to the restrictions deeming them too restrictive. Opponents of the laws often cite the devastating economic impact on nightclubs and live music venues, as well as freedom of movement, as the main counterarguments to the laws. Businesses have suffered greatly due to the losses in revenue and the nightlife culture in Sydney has been drastically changed, as people now move away from the city centre late at night. The lockout laws continue to face strong opposition and are still in place as of June 2021 despite several attempts to repeal them. The NSW Government has recently announced an inquiry and review of the effects of the laws on the industry and patrons, which will be released later in 2021. Regardless of the inquiry's results, the effects of the Sydney lockout laws continue to be felt beyond the city and act as a reminder of the dangers of alcohol-fuelled violence.",

    " Clams casino is a dish typically served on the East Coast of the United States, popularized in the early 20th century. It is considered a type of seafood dish made of clams, bacon and bell peppers, sometimes chopped onions and garlic, all cooked in a white wine and butter sauce, typically with breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. The dish originated in a small Italian-American fishing village known as Clamtown that was located in Little Egg Harbor Township in southern New Jersey. It is unknown who created the dish. However, what is known is that it began to become popular during the first half of the twentieth century, especially in Rhode Island and Connecticut, amongst the Italian American population. Gennaro “Jerry” Pellegrino, a restaurateur who was owner of the renowned landmark Clamtown Chowder House which was established in 1906, likely popularized the dish. The dish is typically made with chopped or diced clams, onions, garlic and bacon that have been cooked together in a skillet before being added to the sauce. The sauce includes butter, white wine or occasionally beer, thyme and sometimes Bell peppers. The sauce is finished with a sprinkle of toasted breadcrumbs. Clams casino is generally served as an appetizer, although it may also be served as a main course. Some restaurants may also serve it as a sandwich filling. The dish can be served either hot or cold. The most common way to prepare Clams casino is to bake it in an oven after the stuffing has been prepared. Some restaurants, particularly in Clamtown, may serve it deep-fried. The dish may be accompanied with various side dishes such as mashed potatoes, rice, or salad. Vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli, as well as fruits like oranges, often accompany the dish. Nowadays, Clams casino is available in all parts of the United States and is considered a classic dish. It remains a popular dish among all age groups, as it is flavorful, filling, and easy to make. The popularity of the dish is such that it has given rise to its own food celebration, the Clams Casino Day, which is observed on August 1, each year.",
    " The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act is a type of legislation used by countries seeking to heal from the wounds of a traumatic past or build a stronger, more inclusive, and just society. This Act seeks to address the lasting impact of past conflicts and human rights violations on societies and individuals. In many cases, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts are accompanied by other forms of reparative justice, such as reparations and memorials. Origins The concept of Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts (TRCAs) originated after the fall of white-ruled South Africa in the early 1990s, when the nation was looking to transition to a new democracy. Although the South African system's main purpose was to step away from the apartheid regime, it also provided an example for how other countries could deal with their own traumatic pasts. The South African individuals involved in the development of this type of legislation sought to create a form of restorative justice which would promote understanding, ensure peace and foster reconciliation between different factions at conflict. In the aftermath of this period, truth and reconciliation commissioners have since been appointed in countries such as Sierra Leone, East Timor, South Africa, Namibia, Peru, Chile, Mali, Austria and Northern Ireland. Process Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts are usually suited to the particular context in which they are being implemented. For example, the goals and objectives of each commission can vary widely. Furthermore, TRACs can determine the ways in which they will collect information, investigate and fact-find, and deliver findings. Generally speaking, the process of a TRAC includes: * Acknowledging and mapping the patterns of human rights abuses; * Allowing victims access to the process of speaking about their experiences (and/or to receive compensation for their suffering); * Fostering an understanding of how and why abuses or crimes were committed and assessing responsibility for those crimes. In certain cases, this may lead to the recommendations of amnesty, reparation or prosecution; * Providing a means of reconciliation between former enemies; * Contributing to the development of a common history of a country or region; * Recommending means for preventing and responding to future human rights violations and/or conflict. Impact The role of Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts have been widely debated due to their potential to provide \"decisive and successful.[1]The term \"success\" is generally understood to include the following elements: * A process that is just and \"balanced\" between victims and perpetrators; * A process that avoids the public spectacle and retribution of traditional trials; * A process that brings perpetrators and victims together to take responsibility and begin a process of reparation; * Creating a national dialogue which can move a society away from retributive justice and toward reconciliation; * The acknowledgment, evidence and documentation of past human rights abuses and violations. Conclusion Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts seek to promote peace, justice, and reconciliation in a society that has experienced a traumatic past. The impact of such legislation depends on the particular context of each commission, as well as their ability to honor and include the voices, stories, and needs of victims of past abuses.",
    " Protected areas of Libya are areas that are legally protected by the government of the North African country of Libya to conserve the natural environment or certain species of flora and fauna. Libya is a region of vast deserts and coastal areas and their protection is important to the preservation of biodiversity. The first protected area to be established in Libya was the Hamada al Hamra National Park in 1965. It is located within the Gulf of Sidra, off the coast of Libya in the Mediterranean Sea. The park covers a total area of 5,400 km2 and is home to a variety of rare species of flora and fauna, including the endangered Mediterranean Monk Seal. The park is also known for its significant archaeological sites, including remains from the Phoenician and Roman empires. In 2009, UNESCO declared the the Archaeological Site of Cyrene a World Heritage Site. This site boasts numerous ancient temples, colonnaded streets, theatres and baths, public squares and an acropolis. It is a key example of the 'Greek colonies in the Mediterranean region'. In 2016, the government announced an ambitious plan to establish a National Parks and Reserves Authority, with the goal of protecting and managing national parks and reserves. The first project of this program was announced in 2018: Kayet Bay National Park. Covering an area of 4,500 km2, this park will protect the diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the southern coastal area of Libya. Libya's coastal areas are particularly affected by climate change, with rising water levels due to global warming. In order to better protect these fragile ecosystems, several other marine protected areas have been established by the Libyan government, including Ras Thaveyta Coastal Park, Bet Generis and Serte Marine Park, and the Hamada al Hamra Marine Park. In 2018, the government also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.N. Environment Programme and the Global Environment Facility, focused on preserving and developing Libya's protected areas. The Libyan government has taken an important step in recognizing the need to protect its unique environment, habitats, and species; however, more effort needs to be made to ensure that these areas are managed and protected. Despite their best efforts, Libya's protected areas are still under threat from poaching, illegal fishing, development projects and increased pressure from the tourism industry.",
    " 1520 (MDXX) was an important year in world history. The year saw a number of significant events, ranging from important political changes to technological advancements. In politics and diplomacy, 1520 marked the year that the Treaty of Tordesillas was formally signed by Portugal and Spain, formalizing the de facto division between the two empires and setting the stage for a period of Iberian dominance in the Atlantic. This year also saw the election of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor - a position of power that Charles V held for more than 40 years. 1520 was also an important year in the history of the Ottoman Empire. Suleiman the Magnificent captured the city of Belgrade, a significant victory in what would become known as the Ottoman-Hungarian wars. At the same time, the conquest of Algiers by the Ottomans also took place, culminating in an eight-year siege of this Mediterranean port. In the field of science and culture, 1520 saw an important development in navigation: the Amazon River was encountered by European explorers, leading to the development of a number of new trade routes and expeditions across the ocean. This year also saw the invention of the printing press and paper money, which revolutionized the way information was spread and commerce was conducted. On a related note, the Diet of Worms saw Martin Luther take a stand against the Catholic Church, leading to the development of Protestantism which would have major implications in Europe and the New World. In 1520, the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II was defeated and killed by Hernán Cortés in Tenochtitlan, thus ending a major era in Mesoamerican history and setting the stage for the colonization of Latin America by the Spanish and Portuguese empires. In 1520, the world population was estimated to be around 450 million, a figure which would more than double to one billion by the mid-19th century. Overall, 1520 was an important year in the history of the world. It saw the formalization of two major empires, a technological revolution, the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation, and the conquest of a major civilization. As a result, its influence can still be felt today.",
    " 1102 in Ireland was an eventful year full of religious and political struggles. It was the time of the Ua Briain High Kingship and their struggles with the Norman invaders. In January of 1102, Dermott of the Ua Briain dynasty was crowned High King of Ireland. Dermott was the son of the previous High King, Mael Sechnaill, and had been chosen by the leading families of Ireland to take his father’s place as High King over the entire island. Dermott was a strong-willed leader and had a reputation for being a great warrior and negotiator. In May, 1102, several Norman lords, led by Hugh de Leversage, arrived in Ireland to take control of much of the region. These Norman armies were determined to take control of Ireland and impose their own culture and government upon it. Dermott was determined to fight them off and after months of fierce fighting, the Normans were eventually defeated. This was also the time of a power struggle between the Irish Church and the Roman Church. In 1102, the Archbishops of Armagh and Tuam supported the Roman Church and their authority while other Irish ecclesiastic leaders, like the Bishop of Dublin, opposed them. Dermott decided to support the Roman Church which caused great tension amongst the Irish. On the international front in 1102, Dermott was instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Athelney between the King of Scotland and the Saxon King of England. This was a major diplomatic accomplishment and a testament to Dermott’s strong leadership. Throughout much of 1102, Dermott worked to strengthen the Ua Briain dynasty’s power in Ireland. He was able to forge alliances with the southern Irish lords and was able to bring much of the country under the domination of the Ua Briain. He also worked hard to use his political clout to combat the Normans and to protect the Irish Church from their influence. 1102 was an eventful year in Ireland which saw incredible political and religious upheaval. Dermott of the Ua Briain dynasty was able to successfully lead the Irish people through these struggles and lay the foundation for a period of relative peace and prosperity. Today, his accomplishments are seen as one of the great examples of Irish leadership and resilience.",

    " Farrukh Shah (b. 1211–1263 CE) was a high-ranking courtier, historian and poet in the court of the Delhi Sultanate. He was the most important adviser to Ghiyasuddin Balban, the ninth Sultan of the dynasty, and also served Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud in the same capacity. Farrukh Shah was born in Qasr-i-Qahira, Iran and belonged to the Abbasid dynasty. He served as a historian in the court of Balban and wrote the Khazayn al-Akhbar, which is a detailed chronicle of political and military events of the Delhi Sultanate from 1211 to 1263 CE. He was well versed in Persian, the court language of the sultanate, and had a reputation of being a well-rounded scholar. He also wrote several famous poetic works, such as the Khazain al-Futuh, or Triumphs of Balban, which extolled the virtues of Balban and his courtiers. Farrukh Shah was well-prepared for diplomatic manoeuvres and was also a gifted organiser. He was responsible for Balban's success in subduing the Rajputs and other rebellious tribes, as well as for Balban's formation of a unified army. He remained loyal to Balban throughout his life and served him well until the end of his reign. Farrukh Shah was made the chief administrator of court affairs after Nasiruddin Mahmud succeeded Balban. He remained in that capacity until 1259 CE, managing state affairs and also maintaining its minted currency, the silver tanka. He further continued to write that statesman’s works throughout this period as well, such as the Futuh al-Alam and the Futuh al-Futuh, both of which extol Nasiruddin Mahmud's courage and successful campaigns.

    " Luna E-6 No.5 was the fifth in a series of robotic spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union between 1963 and 1973. It was part of the Luna E-6 remote lunar exploration program and was designed to return a soil sample from the Moon. Launched on April 2, 1968, it was the fifth of six successful missions to return lunar samples to Earth. The goal of the Luna E-6 program was to obtain and return a sample from the Moon for scientific study. The spacecraft resembled a copy of the Yangel’s R-14 ICBM with the same diameter of 2.3 m and a total mass of 3118 kg. Its design was based on the Luna E-6 model that had already been used in several previous unmanned Moon missions. Luna E-6 No.5 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan by an eight-stage Molniya-M rocket. After reaching lunar orbit, the spacecraft descended to about 20 km above the surface and took four pictures of the area where the sample was to be collected. It then fired its engine for the braking maneuver and began its descent toward the lunar surface. After touching down on the lunar surface, Luna E-6 No.5 used a three-stage extended arm to collect a sample of beneath the surface of the Moon. The sample weighed at least 100 grams and was placed in a protective glass capsule. After collecting the sample, the spacecraft used its engine again to escape from the Moon’s gravity and fired its retro-rockets to reduce its speed, allowing it to enter a geocentric orbit around the Earth. Luna E-6 No.5 successfully returned to Earth on 10 April and impact in the steppe regions of Kazakhstan. Due to its safe return, the Soviet Union was the first country to collect soil samples from the Moon and was a major achievement of the Russian space program. The Luna E-6 No.5 mission was widely publicized and its success opened the way for several other lunar sample return missions. In addition, it served as the template for manned space flights. In 1969, the U.S. Apollo 11 lunar module used a similar type of extended arm to collect a lunar sample.",
    ". The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was an Independent Administrative Institution under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. The agency was formed on October 1st, 1969, and was responsible for Japan's aerospace development and use for peaceful purposes. It also conducted research into space science and technology. NASDA maintained facilities for launch vehicle development, for research and for the manufacture of rockets, satellites and other equipment. Its network of space-related businesses included subcontractors and joint ventures with foreign countries. The agency was responsible for providing shuttle services to the International Space Station. NASDA operated two launch sites, Tanegashima Space Center and Uchinoura Space Center, as well as a satellite tracking station at Noshiro, Akita Prefecture. The agency also owned and managed a number of satellites and other spacecraft. Notably, NASDA was the only Japanese government space organization to have successfully launched a human-rated spacecraft, with the Soyuz F-1 mission in 1994. NASDA was one of Japan's major contributions towards international cooperation in space exploration. The agency initiated a joint venture in the early 1990s called the \"Global Science and Technology Satellite\" (GSTS) which involved international collaboration with five other countries, including the United States and Russia. This project played a significant role in the development of the International Space Station. NASDA also participated in several long-term manned space exploration projects. This included a commitment to the International Space Station in 1998, as well as participation in the Space Shuttle program from 1990 to 1998. In an effort to promote commercialization and utilization of space, NASDA sought to create a public-private partnership that would be viable long-term. To this end, in 2003 the government-backed Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency was established to serve as the successor to NASDA. The new organization was responsible for reintegrating NASDA's main functions, such as launching and managing satellites, controlling ground stations and providing scientific missions in space. NASDA played a unique role in Japan's aerospace industry, pioneering the space industry in the country and facilitating international cooperation in space exploration. NASDA's innovative technologies, research, and launch services greatly contributed to Japan's capabilities in the exploration and utilization of space.

    " Vladimir II Monomakh (c. 1053 – 19 May 1125) was a Grand Prince of Kievan Rus' from 1113 to 1125. His reign saw the last flowering of Kievan Rus' as a unified state and the arrival of the Golden Horde from the east. He was the son of Vsevolod I of Kiev and Anastasia. Vladimir II was prince of Novgorod when his father died. He was crowned in 1113 in a grand ceremony in Kyiv and adopted his father's policy of open-handed peace with the tribes of the steppe. Vladimir II secured the Kievan throne by marrying the daughter of the ruling Grand Prince of the Cumans in 1119. After taking the throne, he helped expand Rus territories southward by taking Yuriev, Pereyaslavl, and a number of other towns. In 1120, an alliance with the Pechenegs allowed Vladimir II to expand his rule beyond the Dnieper River, and he was able to return Kiev and Chernigov, which had been taken by the Cumans. The next year he formed a defensive alliance with King Béla of Hungary against the Cumans. In 1123, a war between Vladimir II and a combined Cuman-Polovtsian force forced him to flee Kiev. The Prince then returned to the steppes and helped the Ukrainian prince Mstislav II conquer Galitch to open up new trade routes to the Black Sea. Invaders from the East started to threaten Kievan Rus', and in 1125 the Polovtsi formed a coalition against Vladimir II's army near Pereyaslavl. The Grand Prince led his army to a decisive victory. The Golden Horde (Tatars) arrived soon after, and although Vladimir II was able to drive them back, he realized he could no longer protect Rus' lands from their repeated attacks. Within four years of his death on 19 May 1125, Kievan Rus' was completely conquered and divided among the invaders. Vladimir II's sons, Mstislav and Svyatopolk, were able to briefly revive Kievan power in the late 12th century. His legacy lives on in Russian narrative sources and folklore, and he is remembered as an able prince who firmly maintained the struggles of thestate, tried to preserve and expand its borders, and negotiated success with both friends and foes.",

    " Systems pharmacology is a field of pharmacology which combines mathematical modeling, computational modeling and applied experimental approaches to study pharmacological systems at the multicellular level. Its main purpose is to integrate the various components of pharmacology, such as drug actions at a cellular level, the interaction between drugs and biological systems, and to study the effects of drug treatment on the whole organism. This approach is important in pharmacology research, as it allows scientists to understand the complex relationship between different drugs and systems in the human body. Systems pharmacology can be divided into two different parts, namely, cell- and tissue-level systems pharmacology and systems pharmacology of the whole organism. At the cell and tissue level, systems pharmacology is used to improve understanding of cellular and tissue responses to individual and multiple drug compounds. For example, systems pharmacology could be used to study the dose-dependent effect of a single drug on cells or tissues, including how the drug interacts with the cell membrane, its effects on cell proliferation, gene expression and metabolism. Similarly, systems pharmacology at the whole organism level is used to study more complex and widespread effects of drug treatments, such as their impact on body homeostasis, as well as the interactions between drug compounds and the physiological/behavioral and environmental effects. Studies using system pharmacology can be broken into two main categories: in-silico modeling and empirical-experimental approaches. In-silico modeling involves the use of mathematical and simulation algorithms to study drug-induced responses in the body. This type of study is important in understanding drug effects, such as dose-dependent effects, the effects of different drug combinations, the interactions between drugs and body systems, and the effect of drug to drug interactions. On the other hand, empirical-experimental approaches involve the study of drug-induced physiological or biochemical responses by experiments. This type of study is important in developing a better understanding of the effects of drugs on the body. Systems pharmacology has become very important in drug discovery and development, as it provides a better understanding of drug-induced responses and toxicities, drug efficacy, and the underlying mechanisms of drug action. This allows researchers to create more efficient, cost-effective treatments and drugs.

Luther at Düsseldorf Observatory in Germany. 166 Rhodope is a primitive carbonaceous asteroid and belongs to the Koronis family of asteroids, which are thought to be fragments from an earlier collision of two larger asteroids. 166 Rhodope is approximately 93 km in diameter and has an albedo of 0.06, which means it reflects only 6% of the light that falls upon it. It takes about 3.7 years to complete an orbit around the Sun, with a semi-major axis of 2.67 AU, a perihelion of 1.9 AU and an aphelion of 3.43 AU. The tilt of its orbit is 6.3°. The asteroid is named after the mountain range of Rhodope located in the southern Balkan peninsula, along the borders of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Rhodope is rich in biodiversity, and is characterized by grasslands and rare vegetation species, with the eastern part of the mountain having some of the largest forests in Europe. 166 Rhodope has been studied by a variety of ground based optical instruments, and its X-ray emissions were observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The asteroid is too far away for detailed studies, but high resolution images suggest that it has a heavily cratered surface, with a handful of larger craters. 166 Rhodope is not thought to have any significant moons, but it may have a few small ones, as most of the asteroids of the Koronis family have them. 166 Rhodope is also a source of numerous meteorites, as it is a common parent body of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Overall, 166 Rhodope is an interesting, primitive example of a carbonaceous Main Belt asteroid, and one of the most studied Koronis family asteroids. It provides an opportunity to study the early stages of solar system formation and the processes that shaped it.",
    " Dobermann (film) is a French action film directed by Jan Kounen and released in 1997. The film stars Vincent Cassel as Dobermann, a ruthless and unstable robber whose reign of terror holds France in the grip of fear and uncertainty. The film follows Dobermann as he takes part in an increasingly violent series of robberies, until finally his criminal ways sabotage not only his own criminal career, but also his relationships with his two closest associates, played by Monia Chokri and José Garcia. The film was written by Kounen and producer Jacques Bled. It was produced by Ciby 2000, with additional backing from Canal+. It premiered in France on March 26, 1997, before being released in the United States by Miramax Films a few months later. Dobermann was generally well-received by critics. It has been touted as an influential crime movie and a precursor to the French New Wave of modern action films. Cassel's performance as the eponymous criminal was praised, as well as the film's stylish visuals and its energetic direction. The film follows Dobermann as he forms his gang, which includes a wide range of criminal types, from slick professional thieves to unbalanced, psychotic thugs. Led by Dobermann, the gang embarks on a series of daring robberies across France, resulting in increasing amounts of violence. In the end, Dobermann's mental instability, coupled with his overconfident and reckless leadership, leads to his downfall. The film is peppered with moments of dark humour, visual style, and surrealism. However, action is the primary focus and the plot is propelled by Dobermann's increasingly daring and evermore immoral antics. The film deviates from typical gangster movie tropes, instead opting for a more off-beat and eccentric style. Overall, Dobermann relies upon its action and violence to create tension and maintain audience interest. Cassel's performance is strong, and though the film seeks to humanize its protagonist it ultimately fails to generate the sympathies of the audience. It is, however, an interesting watch, and a cornerstone of the French New Wave action genre.",

    " The Ural Republic (Uralskaya Respublika) was a short-lived semi-autonomous socialist state that was declared in the Russian SFSR (now the Russian Federation) during the Russian Revolution of 1905. It existed for just over eight months, from December 5th, 1905 to August 14th 1906, when it was overshadowed and dissolved by the newly formed Russian Provisional Government. The idea of a socialist republic in the Ural region originated with liberal members of the Union of Liberation, who sought a decentralized government as an alternative to the imperial rule of the Russian Tsar. The Union of Liberation was a liberal political party that advocated for civil liberties and stronger political representation in Russia. In the beginning of December 1905, the Union held its first congress in the Russian SFSR. There were two key points of the congress: the congress declared the formation of a socialist republic and the adoption of a constitution. On December 5th, 1905, the Ural Republic was officially declared and the socialist government embarked on a program of reform. Due to the common liberal orientation of the organization, many policies and initiatives in the Ural Republic were liberal in nature, including the introduction of a new progressive land code, and the implementing of an eight hour work day for workers. Other reforms included having elected provincial assemblies, and granting voting rights to all adults regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or gender. However, the implementation of these reforms was limited due to the lack of resources in the region. Despite the republic's bold goals, it did not survive long. The Ural Republic was a victim of its own internal divisions, caused mostly by conflicting political ideologies between its members. Furthermore, the newly formed Russian Provisional Government had little to no regard for the new republic and refused to recognize it. As a result, the Ural Republic was completely overshadowed and eventually dissolved. Despite the short life of the Ural Republic, its legacy lives on, as the ideals it championed laid the foundations for future Russian social, civil, and political reforms. It also served as an example to other Russian revolutionaries of the potential of a decentralized, socialist-oriented government. The Ural Republic, which was the first of its kind in Russia, can rightfully be considered one of the country's most significant contributions to the Russian Revolution.",

Il film racconta l'avventura di un gruppo di soldati partiti per combattere nel nord Italia durante la Prima Guerra Mondiale. La storia è vista attraverso gli occhi di uno dei soldati, Luca (Maurizio Arena) che deve prendere una decisione difficile fra quello che la sua coscienza gli dice di fare e quello che gli ordinano i suoi superiori. Luca e i suoi compagni devono decidere se arrendersi o combattere un nemico formato da soldati italiani e austriaci accampati nella stessa zona. Luca ha un profondo senso di onore e di giustizia ed è determinato a non arrendersi, anche quando i suoi compagni lo convincono a prendere questa decisione. Ma quando gli viene data l'opportunità di parlare con i nemici, la sua coscienza lo spinge a cercare un accordo per porre fine allo scontro. Dopo lunghe e intensa discussioni, Luca riesce a trovare una soluzione in grado di soddisfare entrambe le parti. Un Caso di Coscienza è stato ben accolto dalla critica che lo ha definito come un'esperienza di visionario, allegorico e poetico, che sottolinea le complessità morali dei conflitti.

Il personaggio di Luca e la sua introspezione pongono un serio interrogativo etico su quali siano i valori e le scelte migliori da fare. Un Caso di Coscienza è un inno rivolto all'indeterminazione come legge di vita ed è un film importante che rappresenta il coraggio civile e la capacità di rifiutare l'assurdità della guerra.",

    " Locations in South Africa with a Scottish name refer to settlements in the nation that bear the names of various Scottish cities, towns and places. This is due to South Africa's close historical and cultural ties to Scotland, with many of the early settlers to South Africa tracing their ancestry back to Scotland. The most famous place with a Scottish name in South Africa is the city of Edinburgh, located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The city was established in 1889, with the first settlers using Edinburgh in Scotland as the basis for the name of the new settlement. A number of other towns and settlements have also been named after Scottish cities, such as Glasgow and Aberdeen, although perhaps the most interesting example is a small town in the Free State Province, which has been given the rather imaginative name of Scotstown. Besides the cities and towns, there are a number of geographical features which have been named with a Scottish flavour, a notable example being the Machadodorp Mountains. The name ‘Machadodorp’, which was given to the range by Scottish settlers, is derived from the Gaelic words ‘mac’ and ‘duthaich’, which literally mean ‘the mountain with the flat top’. The majority of rivers in this region of the Free State Province are also of Scottish origin, with names like the Doorn and the Whileen. The Scottish influence has also been found further afield within South Africa, with places like Haslemere in the Eastern Cape and Kildare in the Western Cape both bearing Scottish names. The hills and valleys around Stellenbosch in the Western Cape have also acquired names with a Scottish link, including names such as Glen Torrie, Glen Barber and Dornoch. The prevalence of Scottish names in South Africa is a reminder of the strong connections that the country has with Scotland, an influence which will doubtless live on for many centuries to come. The large numbers of Scottish names around the country show the legacy of Scottish settlers, while at the same time serving to remind this generations of the friendship and links which have been forged between Scotland and South Africa over the years.",
    " AIP Records is an American independent record label, which was founded in 1992 by Mike \"Mig\" Matarazzo and Paul Palmer. AIP Records was formed in 1992 as an outlet for the music of several local punk bands that had developed in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas. Matarazzo, who had a background in music production and engineering, and Palmer, who had a business background, formed the label as a means of better showcasing the work of these bands. Over the years, the label primarily specialized in punk, hardcore and ska genres, but it began to expand its musical offerings to include other styles such as alternative rock and pop. The label was initially self-funded and operated by Matarazzo and Palmer out of their respective homes. This allowed the label to take a DIY approach and gave AIP the flexibility to experiment with different sounds and genres. This experimentation included working with a diverse range of artists such as Sublime, D.I. and Roadside Monument. AIP Records was quickly recognized within the independent music scene, leading to the ability to reach a wider audience and an increased presence on the West Coast. They released numerous successful releases, such as Pearl Jam's Ten, Sublime's 40 oz. To Freedom and The Vandals' Peace through Vandalism, in addition to signing and working with established and emerging acts such as Guttermouth, Rancid, The Aquabats, Guttermouth, and The Offspring. Throughout the label's history, AIP has developed many successful artists and released hundreds of albums. Their releases have been noted for their quality and innovation, with many albums being featured on year-end \"Best Of\" lists, as well as receiving various awards and nominations. AIP Records is still owned and operated by Matarazzo and Palmer. They remain active within the independent music scene, and are committed to providing quality music for fans of all genres.

    " The Breit equation is a model of a nuclear force proposed by American physicist Gregory Breit in 1934. It is used to describe the interaction of two particles in a three-dimensional system. The Breit equation is derived from one of the most popular theories of scattering theory, the scattering amplitude theory. The Breit equation is an extension of the exchange of virtual photons between two particles, and is the basis for the exchange of mesons in particle physics. The Breit equation is written as a function of the energy-momentum product (also known as the Mandelstam invariant or \"s-product\"). It is expressed as: F(s,e)=G(s,e)+H(s,e) where G and H are functions of s and e. G is the Gamow factor and H is the exchange-forcing term. The Breit equation can be solved analytically for different values of s and e. The Breit equation was originally developed for the purpose of calculating scattering amplitudes for nuclear and particle physics. But it has recently been used in other fields including optically active crystals, plasmon and polaritons, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. The Breit equation is an important tool in particle physics because it can calculate scattering amplitudes for various processes. This allows researchers to investigate the behavior of particles in different circumstances and to better understand the nature of Nature. The Breit equation is also used in quantum field theory to investigate gravitational interactions and quantum electrodynamics. It is also used to study neutrino oscillations and for calculations of the Bragg peak structure for radiation therapy. The Breit equation is a powerful and versatile tool for understanding the nature and behavior of particles. It is an indispensable part of the scientific arsenal used by physicists to study and develop new and improved theories of fundamental interactions.",
    " Matthew 8 is the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It contains Jesus' curing of a centurion's servant, the expulsion of many demons from two men, and a stilling of the storm. In the beginning of the chapter, Jesus is approached by a centurion who asks Him to heal his servant. Jesus offers to come to the centurion's house and heal the servant Himself, but the centurion states that he is not worthy of such an honor and believes that Jesus' word alone will be enough to do the job. Jesus is impressed by the centurion's faith and says that he will not find such faith in Israel. He then heals the servant from afar. Verse 24 is the start of the stilling of the storm, when Jesus and His disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. As soon as they do, a severe storm comes upon them and Jesus is sleeping. The disciples wake Him up, scared that they will drown, yet Jesus demonstrates His power over nature by commanding the wind and the sea to be still. Instantly, the storm stops and there is a great calm. The first part of the chapter concludes with Jesus' arrival in the land of the Gadarenes. He meets two men possessed by many demons and casts them out. At the command of Jesus, the demons enter a herd of pigs, which then run down a steep bank into the sea and are drown. The second part of the chapter consists of Jesus healing many of the sick people in the region. He touches them and they are instantly healed. He also casts out many demons and is even asked to go away by the people because they are afraid of Him. Matthew 8 is a very important chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, as it is an example of Jesus' power and authority over creation. This power and authority are key points throughout the New Testament, and this chapter emphasizes it with Jesus' stilling of the storm, healing of the sick, and expelling of the demons. In addition, the centurion's faith is an example of what it means to have faith in Jesus.",
    " John Canton Braithwaite (4th June 1745 - 1796) was an English author and acclaimed playwright whose works spanned genres including comedy, drama and romance. He is credited as the first to introduce music into British comedy, revolutionizing the London stage. John Braithwaite was born in London to a family of the middle-class gentry. His father was an attorney and he was educated at a private school in the city. He attended Eton, where he distinguished himself in Latin, Greek, and French and, as an exhibitioner, Oxford, where he studied law. He then trained as an attorney at Lincoln's Inn, but never practiced. Braithwaite first made a name for himself in the theatre, mostly as a writer of farces and comedies. He is best remembered for the popular 1771 play \"_High Life Below Stairs_,\" which spawned several adaptations and was even later adapted into a successful movie in the 1930s. He directed and acted in his productions, garnering acclaim for their musically-inclined wit. His influence on the London theatre scene is still evident today; for example, he was the first to write original music for the stage, an idea that is now a mainstay of modern British and Broadway theatre. He also wrote adaptations of popular French lyrical comedies, including the hugely successful production \"_The Deserter of Naples_\" in 1777. His other works included the book _Rural Life: An Essay_ (1774), as well as translations of German works, and a number of political lyrics and satires. John Braithwaite died suddenly in 1796 after a long period of illness; his funeral was well-attended, underscoring his widespread popularity. He left behind a wife, three children and an extensive literary legacy, with works that remain read and appreciated to this day. A student prize is held in his name at the University of Oxford, and a monument was erected in 1833 in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He is remembered as a pioneer of the British theatre and his influence can still be seen in the edgy and musically-inclined comedies produced today.",
    " Spider is a type of pulp fiction magazine that centres around the exploits of a particular protagonist. It appeared in the United States during the early twentieth century, between 1944 and 1949, with a brief revival in the form of a paperback series in the 1970s. The original Spider magazine was created by award-winning pulps publishers Popular Publications. It initially used the pseudonym Grant Stockbridge for its authors, although later issues did feature appearances by some famous authors such as Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, and Norvell Page. The stories for each numeral featured a vigilante anti-hero named The Spider, whose true identity was never disclosed, who solved problems with his special brand of justice. The Spider was given a few superhuman abilities, such as a superhuman intuition and the ability to create chemical weapons. His real name was Richard Wentworth, although most of his antagonists addressed him as The Spider. The Spider first appeared in issue number 1 (October 18th, 1944) and quickly gained an audience of fans devoted to crime-fighting stories that were fast-paced and action-packed. He was the feature character in 66 of the next 78 issues before the magazine was discontinued in 1949. This magazine was referred to as \"Spicy Detective\" in the early issues and \"The Spider Magazine\" in late issues, due to its content being considered to be ‘spicy’ by the standards of its time. The stories followed The Spider's adventures as he fought criminals from all types of crime: from gangsters to mad scientists, alien monsters to Nazi spies. Over the years, The Spider was shaped into a vigilante figure, with stories becoming even more violent and risque than in the original run. In 1970, a paperback series was published that reprinted collected Spider stories from early issues. The stories, which had been extensively edited for the new audience, were a moderate success but the series was short-lived and by 1974, it had vanished again. Due to its long absence and lack of exposure, The Spider and the magazine he personified are all-but forgotten among new generations of readers. While the magazines were never part of the popular culture, they had a powerful influence on the genre of superhero and vigilante stories, and The Spider will always remain a nostalgic bit of pulp fiction history.",
    " Symphony No. 4 in E minor, Op. 60 (1933) by Karol Szymanowski is a work for large orchestra composed in the late years of the Polish Romantic composer's life. It was composed during the spring of 1933 at a passionate and tumultuous period in Szymanowski’s life, and was a critical work in the development of the composer’s final style. The first performance of the symphony occurred in February 1935, when it was played by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer’s pupil, Grzegorz Fitelberg. In its premiere concert, the work was coupled with Szymanowski’s 1st and 3rd Symphonies. The formal structure of the symphony is in four movements. It begins with an Allegro initial movement that serves as an abiding entity throughout. An episode takes up the middle section, and the whole is concluded with a brilliant, energetic recapitulation of the opening materials. The second movement is a dramatic scherzo and trio based on an idyllic, pastoral melody. It is marked by swiftness of tempo and fleeting, modulatory ambiences, and features habanera- and polonaise-style rhythms that introduce a sonic awareness of Szymanowski’s native Poland. The third movement is a somber “Largo”, in which a cast of woodwind instruments assume dominant roles. The music here is slow and contemplative, with a broad, static wall of sound. It is built around longer melodic lines and slowly developing imitative contrapuntal strands that give the music a dreamy, reflective nature. The fourth and final movement is a brilliant “Finale” of sparkling, brilliant sonorities and larger-than-life dynamics and textures. It presents a panoramic view of the orchestra in its full power, to the backdrop of a cyclic theme and a tumultuous string of bravura cadences in the closing moments of the symphony. Symphony No. 4 is emblematic of Szymanowski’s late, mature compositional style, with its eclectic use of Polish folklore, impressionist harmonies, and exotic sonorities. The work was a success upon its premiere, and since then it has gone on to become a popular piece in the orchestral repertoire. It has had several recordings, released on various record labels, and since 2004 it has been featured in a number of festivals commemorating the composer’s 125th anniversary.",
    " The Louisville and Nashville Depot of Evergreen, Alabama, is an important landmark in the city that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The two-story Romanesque Revival style depot was built in 1903 and served as the main passenger depot in the city for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad until 1971. The depot is a two-story red brick building that was designed by noted architect Jarrott McKnight. The interior of the depot was designed to be ornate, with the ceilings and walls covered in tile and mosaic. The building also originally featured three waiting rooms, ticket offices, and a restaurant. The building served as not only a passenger depot, but also a major center of commerce. During the 1930s and 40s many cotton producers used the facility to ship and receive products while several personal offices and freight companies opened at the adjacent freight office. The depot has been an important part of Evergreen's history for over a century and is among the few remaining depots from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad that still exists. The depot is located in the center of the city directly across from the Conecuh County Court House. In October 2019, the Evergreen Preservation Group acquired the building from CSX in an effort to restore the depot and create a gateway to downtown Evergreen for residents and tourists. The preservation group intends to renovate the depot with the assistance of grants from the state and federal governments and to use the facility to host local events. The goal is to create a cultural hub and community center in the heart of the city.

    " The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (or IKMC) is an initiative created to facilitate creation of knockout mouse models that are available to the worldwide research community. The consortium is coordinated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Jackson Laboratory and several additional partner organizations. The consortium's goal is to generate up to 5,000 new targeted mutations, each one in its own named mouse line, by the year 2024. The IKMC provides researchers with a network of common resources and services that facilitate efficient production of mouse lines carrying targeted mutations. This helps reduce the technical and resource burden that individual research laboratories carry when producing their own targeted mutation mouse models. The IKMC’s targeted mouse model generation services are funded by the Wellcome Trust and member contribution. The IKMC produces mouse models carrying mutations in genes identified by the research community, reviewed and approved by a scientific committee. Feedback from the community is used to prioritize the genes of interest, develop new services and enhancements, and to help guide the resource allocation in order to ensure maximal benefit to the research community. The goal of the IKMC is to make all created resources available to the entire research community, so it has made an agreement with the international non-profit, Mouse Genome Informatics, to house publicly available and annotated mouse lines on their website, so they can be accessed by the research community. They have also started a data sharing partnership with the Mammalian Synthetic Biology Reference Data Archive, so that genotyping and mutation data can be shared. The IKMC has also created some other services for the research community, such as a community portal for discussion, a registry for requesting and tracking mouse lines and reagents, and a user-guided compliance support service. Additionally, it offers a series of training courses in mouse genetics, which are designed to help researchers better understand genetic approaches to disease modeling and experimental design. The initiative not only has the potential to significantly reduce research costs, but also could speed up the preclinical research process, contributing to the development of new therapies for human diseases. As the IKMC continues to work towards its goal and create new resources, it will become a valuable asset for the research community.",

    " Fluid kinematics is the study of how fluids of any type – including combustible gases, liquids and slurries – move in a variety of ways. This branch of mathematics covers an array of complex dynamics, such as turbulence, viscosity and drag force. It has applications in many scientific realms, including physics, engineering, aeronautics and climatology. In natural phenomena, fluids typically move in one of two forms – laminar or turbulent. They are designated as such depending on their velocity, or the rate of their movement. Laminar flows occur when the velocity of the fluid is steady and the individual molecules follow well-defined paths. Turbulent flows, by comparison, involve chaotic and unpredictable movements that are characterized by vortices and eddies. When it comes to modeling how fluids move, the principles of fluid kinematics combine both laminar and turbulent mechanisms. Depending on the scope of the study, a wide range of formulas may be employed to calculate the fluid's velocity, acceleration and momentum. The principles of fluid kinematics also enable researchers to understand how changes in a fluid's kinetic energy affects sound production and heat transfer. One of the most important aspects of fluid kinematics is the behavior of fluids that are experiencing a drag force. This force occurs when an object is moving through a fluid and must overcome the resistance of the molecules around it. As this resistance increases, the object's speed decreases. The behavior of fluids in such settings is analyzed extensively in the field of fluid dynamics, which is closely related to fluid kinematics. In addition to fluid dynamics, fluid kinematics has practical advances in many fields. It is employed in medical fields, such as physiology and biophysics, to understand the behavior of blood flow and other body fluids in living organisms. It also has applications in engineering and aeronautics, where it is used to model fluid flow patterns in machines, such as aircraft and wind turbines, and streamline their performance. In conclusion, fluid kinematics is an important branch of mathematics that allows for the analysis of complex motion in fluids. It is used across many scientific disciplines, from physics to engineering and biomedical science, to predict and manipulate the behavior of liquids and gases.",
    " Business casual is an ambiguously defined Western dress code, commonly accepted in large corporations, universities, and government offices. The term business casual originated in the United States in the late 1980s/early 1990s when many companies encouraged their employees to dress more casually, attempting to move away from the “stuffy” and rigid formal wear expected before. Generally speaking, business casual is considered to be more formal than typical casual clothes, but still allows the wearer to maintain a level of comfort. The definition of business casual varies with context and geographic location, but when deciding what to wear, it is important to be aware that many organizations will still enforce dress codes and safety requirements to ensure a professional appearance. Common items that are worn in a business casual environment include collared shirts, khaki trousers, sweaters and cardigans, dressy skirts, dressy shorts, dressy underwear, slacks, and well-polished dress shoes. Business casual does not include ripped jeans, shorts, sandals, T-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, or other casual attire. Business casual attire has become increasingly popular for those in professions with a higher standard of dress. It is also common to find business casual attire in the banking, financial, legal and real estate industries. Ambiguity in the definition of business casual has resulted in a wide range of interpretations and has caused many people to dress inappropriately in the workplace. Irrespective of the exact definition of business casual, it is important to remember that personality and smartness are still important, and any out of the ordinary clothing will likely stand out and be noticed. Different industries may require different levels of dress depending on their environment. For example, the financial or banking sector might require a more tailored or professional look, such as a three-piece suit and tie. On the other hand, a technology company could abide by a more relaxed dressing code, allowing for jeans, polos, but still excluding athletic wear. As such, it is important to research the particular dress code requirements for each industry and workplace to ensure that one is dressed appropriately. When in doubt, it is best to err on the side of caution and dress more formally. Overall, the evolution of business casual has provided employees with more comfortable and attractive options than traditional business attire, and this has in turn made it easier for employers to hire and retain talent. With the continued evolution of the modern workforce, it is important for each individual and their managers to identify what dress code fits their particular needs.",
    " Paul Maas (1880 - 1987) was a Dutch botanist and professor at Utrecht University. He was an internationally renowned specialist in grasses and sedges and made major contributions to plant geology, plant physiology, and plant taxonomy. Maas studied biology and medicine at Utrecht and Leiden universities, later continuing his studies in Paris and Brussels. In 1908, he completed his doctoral thesis, On the Anatomy and Systematics of Poaceae. Following this, he spent time in Java and Suriname to research tropical grasses and their habitats. During World War I, Maas served as a reserve officer in the 5th Infantry Regiment in Zwolle, where he studied soil textures and the spread of vegetation. In 1917, Maas was appointed professor at Utrecht and 18 years later, made professor of vegetation science and botany. During his time at Utrecht, Maas led several expeditions to study the distribution of plants and developed a technique for drying and measuring plants. Much of his research focused on reeds and sedges, of which he wrote five monographs. Maas is also known for his landmark work in vegetation science, Flora Neerlandica. This book detailed the vegetation and grasses of the Netherlands, describing the biodiversity of both natural and cultivated environments. Maas’s work was widely recognised, and over his career, he received many awards and honours in botany, including the most prestigious award of the Dutch Botanical Society in 1956. In addition to his research, Maas was an active member of several professional organisations, primarily the Dutch Botanical Society. Maas is considered one of the most important botanists of the twentieth century, having made significant contributions to plant ecology, systematics, and taxonomy. His work remains highly relevant for the study of plants today and is regarded as foundational for the fields of morphology and vegetation science. Despite his international fame, Maas was also remembered for his generosity and sense of community, donating his time to engage with local organisations and student societies to share his knowledge and enthusiasm for botany. Maas died in 1987, at the age of 107, leaving behind a legacy of extensive research and publications.",
    " The Francis D. Williams House is a historic two-story timber frame home in the historic district of Pinopolis, South Carolina. Built in 1839, it was the residence of Francis D. Williams, a prominent local plantation owner and politician. The Williams House, as it is commonly known, is a two-story weatherboarded wood frame I-house with a central hall and two rooms on each side. It was originally constructed by Samuel Cheesborough, one of the first settlers of what would later become Pinopolis. The house has a central gable roof and a pair of low-pitched Doric-style front porches. The roof is constructed of \"shingles and is topped with a central cupola adorned with finials and a mahogany weather vane. In 1895, Francis D. Williams and his wife, Millie, moved from the house following Williams’ successful bid for the South Carolina House of Representatives. The house then became the residence of A.M. Keller, and in 1911, it was purchased by the Pinopolis Express newspaper. The newspaper used the house and its grounds as its office and printing shop until 1945. In 1985, the house and grounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the most well-preserved early 19th century houses in South Carolina, and its historical significance lies in its association with Williams, his family and his values. The house underwent renovations in the late 20th century, including a modern kitchen and updated bathrooms, but the original architectural elements remain intact. The house has since become a local landmark.

Yukio was often frustrated by this, and while he kept his cool and kept encouraging his friend, it took a while before Yukio himself was able to perform the same feats as Takumi. Yukio is the owner of an AE86, a car that Takumi eventually took over when Yukio was forced to sell it due to mounting repair costs. It was Yukio who taught Takumi driving techniques, like the clutch kick and Scandinavian flick, and even confessed to Takumi that he lost the mountain race due to an internal conflict in his mind because he had been teaching Takumi the skills that he himself could not master. Throughout the series, Yukio remains supportive of his best friend and willing to give him advice no matter what. He is often one of the few characters in the series who is willing to stay and have a beer with Takumi, even when it seems like all has been lost. At the conclusion of the fourth and final stage of the series, Yukio and Takumi are seen together, reflecting on their time racing together. Together with the rest of the Akina Speed Stars, Yukio and Takumi escape to the mountains for one last hurrah to celebrate all that they accomplished together. Throughout the series, Yukio is the one constant that Takumi can rely on. Although he has his flaws, Yukio's friendship and willingness to help provide a moral backbone to the series that helps Takumi keep going, no matter how tough things get.",

    " Clientitis is a term to describe a type of corporate behavior in which a company devotes an inordinate amount of energy to the demands of their current clients. This behavior typically leads to an overemphasis on existing customers at the expense of other important priorities such as market research, product innovation and diversification. The term is specifically used to describe a situation in which current customer’s needs become the primary focus of the business. At times, this can lead to a certain type of myopic tunnel vision where the company’s existing customers become a dictating force. Companies that fall into this pattern of behavior often redefine themselves to meet the specific needs of clients who have become dominant users of the product or service. The patterns of behavior inherent in clientitis present challenges to the sustainability of a company’s growth. Companies that come to prioritize the whims of their customers run the risk of alienating potential future clientele, or failing to see the importance of emerging market segments. This loyalty to existing customers can also divert resources away from vital activities such as research and development, or marketing of new services and products. The symptoms of clientitis can manifest in various ways, including: maximizing current customer retention for short-term gains, committing extensive resources to address the requests of large customers, and running promotions and introductory offers specifically tailored to existing customers. The effects of clientitis may not be visible until after long periods of time, which makes it difficult overcome once entrenched in the corporate culture. Historically, large-scale companies have been the most vulnerable to clientitis due to their size and tendency to attach certain management processes to particular accounts. Smaller companies have typically been able to outmaneuver the symptoms of clientitis by changing their strategies quickly, responding to customer requests quicker than larger competitors. Overall, it is important for corporations to recognize the consequences of clientitis and ensure that it does not take precedence over more crucial business activities. Companies must make it a priority to properly balance their current customer needs with their long-term business objectives. Doing so will enable them to improve their relationship with existing customers, while also preparing them to better capitalize on new market segments.",

    " Simon de Brantingham (active early 16th century) was an English knight who served in the armies of Henry VIII, and developed a military system that allowed him to successfully keep a large body of troops equipped and supplied. In 1513 he was appointed captain of the King's Troop of 12,000 men-at-arms, the largest mounted force ever assembled in the history of England. De Brantingham began his career in military service in the retinue of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, and held a number of temporary positions in the various armies of the time. In 1507 he was one of 1,000 men-at-arms who attended the wedding of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon at Greenwich. He was part of the entourage, when Henry and an army of 50,000 invaded France in 1513, and was made captain of the King's Troop, the vanguard of the army. De Brantingham developed an innovative system for the equipping and supply of the 12,000 men. Every six men were assigned a wagon and provisions for month's service. De Brantingham divided the army into a number of companies and brigades which were assigned to march along the roads for a specified number of days and make camp at night. He also developed a system of accountability for material losses and ensured that all of the men were paid and provided with proper care and provisions. At the Battle of the Spurs on 16 August 1513, de Brantingham's troops formed part of the vanguard and was praised by the King for his effective supply and troop management. He was knighted later that year and continued to serve in France until 1514. Following his time in France, de Brantingham served on various military campaigns with Henry VIII, ranging from Scotland to France. He was also involved in building and equipping fortresses along the English coast in preparation for a possible invasion by the French. In March 1515, de Brantingham was sent on a diplomatic mission to Spain to negotiate a possible alliance between the two countries. This mission was unsuccessful and in 1517 de Brantingham was arrested on suspicion of treason and sent to the Tower of London. He was pardoned shortly afterwards and went on to serve in military campaigns during the 1520s, but his career ended in 1531 when he was formally discharged from military service. No record of his subsequent career exists, but he likely returned to his family estate in Hampshire. He died sometime before 1567, as his will was proved in that year. Simon de Brantingham's career was remarkable for its length of service and its innovation. His supply system ensured that the armies of the time could move with efficiency and that the troops were properly supplied and paid. He was a highly respected leader who was awarded a knighthood for his service, a testament to both his skill and his dedication to duty.",

    " Page Fence Giants was a professional black baseball team which existed from 1894 to 1905, based in Adrian, Michigan. The team was organized in 1894 by Nelson Page, a former Adrian resident who owned a number store there. The team was composed largely of former semi-pro players from the area, and was named after the company Page owned, the Page Fence Company. Their games were held in a park near the corner of North Main and Broadway streets. It had a seating capacity of two thousand and was surrounded by white picket fence, earning the team its namesake. Professional teams from the eastern United States would travel to Adrian to face the Page Fence Giants, who were well-known for their style of play during the games. The team enjoyed success and was financially successful, every game selling out and every season profitable. The Giants also made regional and national tours, playing against teams like the New York Cuban Giants, the Chicago Unions and the Cuban X Giants. The team’s star players included pitcher William Binga, outfielder Robert \"Reggie\" Williams and catcher William \"Dizzy\" Dismukes. Binga played from 1894 to 1895, Williams from 1895 to 1898, and Dismukes from 1903 to 1905. The squad also featured Hoss Radbourne, a pitcher who would go on to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Giants' success led to a scandal in which the team was accused of being involved in a betting scandal and receiving payment from gamblers to throw the Championship Game in 1902. This ended the team's stay in Adrian. After the Giants disbanded in 1905, the Page Fence Company reorganized and became the Page Fence Company Athletic Club, which played amateur baseball and other sports until 1920. Today, The Adrian Historical Society recognizes the Page Fence Giants as a pivotal part of Michigan's baseball history. Teams like the Page Fence Giants paved the way for black Major League talent and formed the foundation of the \"Negro Leagues\".

    " Kentucky Gold is a white bourbon whiskey created and bottled under the umbrella of Maker's Mark. It is a limited-release spirit available in select states throughout the United States, including Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Tennessee. History The whiskey was first made available in March 2018, after Maker's Mark announced the release of the special edition spirit at an event at the distillery in Loretto, Kentucky. Master Distiller Greg Davis described the process of making the whiskey, which follows a different path than the distillery’s traditional whiskey. Davis said the process begins with a mash of locally sourced corn and malted barley, with a special variation of Maker’s Mark yeast. The whiskey is then distilled in a copper pot still using a mash bill of 70 percent corn. After it is distilled, the spirit is barrel-aged for a minimum of 10 years in a variety of new and used Maker’s Mark barrels. Kentucky Gold whiskey is intended to be a celebration of Maker’s Mark’s commitment to small-batch distilling and a subtle nod to the brand’s long tradition of producing high-quality spirits from grain to bottle. The whiskey is meant to be enjoyed neat or on the rocks, and it is non-chill filtered. Distribution Kentucky Gold is a limited-edition spirit and is available in select states throughout the United States, including Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Tennessee. There is no set release date, and bottles may appear sporadically throughout the United States. Maker’s Mark also recommends contacting local retailers or bourbon enthusiasts online to inquire about its availability. Reviews reviewers praised Kentucky Gold for its smooth, oaky flavor with “sweet apricot,” “soft spice,” and “floral notes.” Others noted the whiskey’s balance of dry, nutty notes from the longer aging process. Its age and unique spirit profile make it desirable for those who want an aged bourbon in a non-chill filtered whiskey. Conclusion With its unique production process and a flavor profile featuring sweet apricot and floral notes, Kentucky Gold is a limited-edition addition to the Maker’s Mark portfolio. Crafted from grain to bottle, each hand-bottled bottle is a celebration of Kentucky and Maker’s Mark’s commitment to small-batch distilling.",
    " Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of erythroid precursors and is related to the human protein transferrin receptor. It acts as an iron-uptake receptor to the cell surface and is used as a marker of erythropoiesis in medical diagnosis. The sTfR gene is located on chromosome 3p25.1-25.2 and has four exons. The full length mRNA contains 1585 nucleotides, which can produce a protein of 353 amino acids with a molecular weight of 39.477 kDa. sTfR shares structural homology with several other cellular receptors including scavenger receptor, major histocompatibility complex class II receptors, cell adhesion molecules and desialylated transferrin receptor. sTfR is primarily expressed in erythroid precursors, though low expression has been detected in hepatocytes, myeloid defined precursors, thymocytes and monocytes. sTfR plays an important role in erythropoiesis by facilitating iron uptake into developing erythrocytes and ensuring the proper development of adequate erythroid precursors. On the cellular surface, sTfR exists in two forms: a membrane-bound form and a soluble form. The soluble form is generated by shedding of membrane-bound sTfR by the action of metalloproteases. The importance of soluble sTfR has been established in recent years since it is more specific and more reliable as a marker of erythropoiesis, due to its independence from changes in erythroid precursors. The level of sTfR in the body can be measured in the serum or plasma of a patient. In healthy individuals, sTfR levels are low, usually between 0.4-1.25 mg/L. However, in cases of anemia, sTfR levels can be significantly higher or lower depending on the underlying cause. In conditions such as iron deficiency anemia, sTfR is generally found to be higher than normal, while in other conditions such as thalassemia, sTfR is usually found to be lower than normal. In addition, soluble transferrin receptor has been used in diagnosis of certain diseases such as sickle cell anemia, hemoglobinopathies, and in monitoring response to therapy in thalassemia patients. The use of sTfR as a biomarker is particularly useful in diagnosing deficiencies and in assessing the severity of anemia. Overall, sTfR is an important biomarker that helps medical specialists in the diagnosis and monitoring of various anemias, as well as the response to treatment. References: 1.

    " Channel stuffing is a type of inventory fraud associated with the marketing and sales practices of a business. In channel stuffing, companies force their distributors to take multiple shipments of goods that they cannot immediately sell or use. The aim of channel stuffing is to artificially inflate sales and profits of a particular period and deceive investors, creditors and shareholders. It is a form of financial statement manipulation done by companies in an effort to enhance their financial performance. The result of channel stuffing is an increase in the quantity of goods reported on the income statement as sales, but which actually do not move into the marketplace. The effect of this can be wide-ranging, including overstated sales results, inventory imbalances, strained relationships with customers and partners, and ultimately, it may lead to incorrect financial results and a possible SEC filing violation. Channel stuffing is a form of fraud because it undermines the integrity of a company's financial results by creating misrepresentations in the firm's financial reporting. It involves the mis-allocation of goods as they pass through a supply chain, which, if not managed properly, can result in inflated inventory levels, unhealthy customer relations and an incorrect view of sales. Channel stuffing is thought to occur when 1) a company has an incentive to recognize additional sales or revenues; 2) a company has access to delivery channels for the goods, or; 3) when a company needs to turn around its financial fortunes in the short-term. Companies indulge in channel stuffing in an attempt to artificially boost their sales and profits. Businesses can employ this technique by shipping more goods than necessary to distribution centers, selling goods to customers at a discount to move more inventory, and allowing retailers to return more stock than usual. This form of manipulation makes financial statements inaccurate as it is based on transactions that are not properly reflecting the actual conditions of the market and the supply and demand of goods. Channel stuffing is considered a serious form of corporate fraud and carries penalties under the law. It can lead to indictment or significant fines, or both. For example, in 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an executive and two companies of channel stuffing (among other things) and ordered them to pay over US $9 million in fines and disgorgements. In conclusion, channel stuffing is a manipulative practice meant to artificially increase a company's sales and income by moving goods improperly or to customers that do not intend to buy. It undermines the integrity of financial statements and is subject to criminal and/or civil penalties. Investors should carefully monitor signals that a company may be channel stuffing, such as significantly increasing inventory and cash sales.",

    " The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was held on November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election. Indiana voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris against Republican Party incumbent Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence (incumbent). Indiana is a red state and has voted for the Republican candidate in state elections since 2008, except for the 2008 presidential election when Barack Obama won the state’s 11 electoral votes. Donald Trump easily won the state in the 2016 election garnering 57% of the vote compared to Hillary Clinton’s 38% of the vote. Despite Trump’s dominance in the state a number of polls leading up to the election had the race a virtual tie. Real Clear Politics showed Trump ahead in all polls until the week of the election first by as much as 6% to less than 1%. On election day, November 3, as most of the in-person voting ended, Donald Trump won Indiana's 11 electoral votes despite the polls leading up to the election. Trump won 54.3% of the vote compared to Joe Biden's 43.8%, utilizing a rural advantage. Biden made a slight improvement in the cities and suburbs in comparison to Hillary Clinton in 2016 boosting his statewide vote share from 37.9% to 43.8%, while Trump saw a slight dip from 57.2% in 2016 to 54.3% in 2020. Turnout was higher in the 2020 election in comparison to 2016, reaching 79.3% of eligible voters, up from 75.9% in the 2016 election. In the end, Biden's efforts to build on Obama's gains in the state, most notably in the cities and suburbs, was blocked by Trump's overwhelming rural vote total. Trump won every county in Indiana outside of Lake and Marion counties, with Marion going to Biden by less than half a point. These two counties were also the areas Biden gained the most votes from 2016. Overall, Biden's slight gains in the heavily populated counties were blocked by Trump's rural vote and the fact that Trump won all other counties, leading to his second and final victory in Indiana. The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was marked as another clear victory for the Republican Party in the state. Trump's win is the sixth victory in a row for the GOP in the presidential election, with the last Democratic challenger to win the state being Barack Obama in 2008.",
    " Agriculture in the Philippines is one of the primary sources of income for many of the country’s citizens. Along with fishing and forestry, it provides the bulk of the food and other necessities. Agricultural products such as rice, corn, beef, chicken, and pork make up the majority of the Filipino population’s daily meals. Most farms in the Philippines are small-scale and family-owned, with a few larger commercial operations. Fruits and vegetables are also important crops, and coconut, banana, mango, and pineapple are especially plentiful. The region's climate is tropical and typically favors agriculture. The Philippines is known for its abundance of land, including numerous rivers and wide plains, enabling farmers to cultivate and harvest plants for commercial sale. Many of the soil’s nutrients have been depleted due to over-farming, making it necessary to use fertilizers and water conservation methods in order to maximize yield. Despite its potential, production in the Philippines remains limited due to a number of factors, such as lack of investment in new technologies, insufficient infrastructure and agricultural extension services, and the prevalence of poverty. Further development of irrigation systems, research facilities, and technical training programs could help increase crop yields and promote progressive farming practices. The government of the Philippines has recently implemented a number of initiatives to boost agricultural production and help the farming sector become more competitive. This includes providing subsidies to farmers, establishing crop insurance and microfinance, and creating a modern market system. Additionally, the government has provided extension services and better access to technology to encourage more production. Agriculture in the Philippines remains essential to providing food and employment for its citizens. While the sector faces considerable challenges, the recent interventions of the government will hopefully lead to sustained growth in the near future. With increased investment and technical assistance, the Philippines can become a major producer of agricultural products and competitive in the global market.",

Bidens hyperborea is an important species in mountaintop environments because of its ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and its mycorrhizal relationships with certain fungi. Its presence on mountain slopes stabilizes the soil and reduces the risk of landslides and mudslides which can occur when roots are excluded from the landscape. The plant also provides food and habitat for a variety of mountain living organisms making it an integral part of mountain ecosystems. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently lists Bidens hyperborea as being of least concern and not at risk of extinction. Despite its current status, the species is believed to be vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, increased monitoring of the species is needed to ensure the continued survival of Bidens hyperborea and its important role in mountain ecosystems.",
    " Albert Schultens (21 July 1686 - 22 April 1750) was a Dutch Orientalist and theologian, noted for his critical editions of Arabic manuscripts. A native of Groningen, Netherlands, Schultens received his education at the Latin school of the University of Groningen before beginning his study of theology at Leiden University in 1705. Throughout his time at Leiden, Schultens took up the study of Arabic, Persian and Turkish to complement his knowledge of theology. After qualifying as a Doctor of Theology in 1714, Schultens moved to Italy, where he would further deepen his knowledge of languages and ancient manuscripts, including a two-year residence in Rome. Schultens went on to become a professor of ancient languages at Groningen University in 1721, where he was appointed rector in 1737. In 1722, Schultens accepted a position at the recently established University of Harderwijk, where he taught the oriental tongues. In 1743, Schultens returned to Leiden to teach Ancient Languages, a post which he held until his death in 1750. During his lifetime, Schultens wrote numerous books, essays, and commentaries on oriental languages and theological matters. His works include an edition of the Persian poet Hafez, a critical edition of the Koran, a Latin translation of Ali bin Sahl Rabban al-Tabari’s history, a Dutch translation of The Thousand and One Nights, and an Arabic-English dictionary. Schultens’ most notable achievement is his geographic survey of the Islamic world, Nova Descriptione Orbis Arabici. In addition to his contributions to oriental studies, Schultens held a deep interest in theology, making a number of contributions to the field, particularly with regard to Christian-Muslim relations. He is best known for his publications discussing the views of John Calvin on Islam, such as A Defence of John Calvin Against the Defamatory Rabbi at Damascus. Schultens’ works achieved a great deal of recognition in his lifetime, and were highly influential on later Orientalists, particularly Sir William Jones, who in 1784 praised Schultens’ accessible works on the Arabic and Persian language. Schultens’ ongoing legacy is recognized today in institutions such as the Albert Schultens Chair in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Groningen University. ",

He was later admitted to the bar in 1882. Turner soon established a law practice in Nashville. He also dedicated his time to politics and the fight for civil rights. Turner became involved in civic organizations, including the YMCA and the NAACP, and was active in the Republican Party. He became president of local chapters of the Republican Party and was elected to the Tennessee State Legislature in 1888. In 1897 Turner ran for mayor of Nashville. He won, and he served from 1898 to 1902. During his term, he implemented a number of progressive reforms, including expanding the city's electrical system, banning saloons, and establishing a police department.

The song was co-produced by DJ Dahi and Dat Don. \"Save Dat Money\" is an ode to financial responsibility and frugality, in contrast to the more typical theme of ostentatious wealth and extravagance prominent within hip hop music. The song's catchy hook contains a play on the phrase \"fake it 'til you make it\", instead singing: \"Save that money, get that money, never spend that money/Work hard, find a way, no matter what the pay\". The accompanying music video, released on June 8, 2015, was directed by Tony Yacenda and filmed in a large suburban house in Thousand Oaks, California. It was produced by Mike Dierich, Julian Christian, and Alvaro Menendez, with executive producers Charles D. Shields and Kristen Hamilton. The music video starts with an introduction by Dr. Dre, who formally announces the song via a faux scientific presentation demonstrating the effectiveness of the song in getting people to save money instead of spending it. The video then breaks out into a party scene, featuring appearances from Kevin Durant, Mark Cuban, Tom Segura, Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Hannibal Buress and many other celebrities. Upon its release, the reception to \"Save Dat Money\" was largely positive. The song was praised for its distinctly different approach to rap and its overall message.

It has since served as a crossroads of sorts for the many travelers who venture between Morgantown, West Virginia and Cumberland, Maryland. The town bears the name of its founding father, although the \"Mills\" part of the name was added in the late 19th century to acknowledge the town's busy mill. Located at the junction of West Virginia Route 26 and County Route 45, much of Bruceton Mills' history is tied to these two roads which have served as important transportation routes for the region. The town maintains a general store and post office, as well as a few other businesses, making it a vibrant part of the region.

    " Ethnodoxology is a field of study within the field of intercultural music research concerning the musical expressions of a particular people group. It is concerned with the relationships between music, culture, and spirituality within a particular culture or Indigenous population. Ethnodoxology is a growing area of interest in the field of theoretical and practical musicology, music education, and the broader field of ethnomusicology. The term “ethnodoxology” was coined in 1999 by Dr. Dale A. Olsen, an emeritus professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Since then, the term has been used by a variety of scholars to describe this academic field of study. As a sub-field of ethnomusicology, it is concerned with the impact of traditional music on a specific culture and religious expression, and the educational, spiritual, and social implications of that impact. The field of ethnodoxology focuses on understanding traditional music from the perspective of the people living the culture, which is distinct from the more objective perspective of Western musicology. Ethnodoxology seeks to examine music through an experiential approach, which places the cultural expressions at its center. Notable theorists within the field consider that traditional music contains a set of ontological and axiological characteristics that are fundamental to the culture and thus inextricably linked to its identity. For the practitioner, this means that ethnodoxology seeks to prioritize understanding traditional music within a culture before adapting it to any other purpose. This calls for a greater emphasis not only on learning the technical and sensory aspects of a particular style or piece, but also on understanding the cultural context to which those elements belong. Some have argued that the goal of ethnoixology is to “engage all aspects of music, including intellectual, physical, and spiritual,” as well as its historical, geographical, cultural, and social context. Through this emphasis on understanding, the field seeks to contribute to the growth of inter-cultural understanding and sensitivity. One of the primary goals of ethnodoxology is to contribute to the sustainability of traditional music and culture in an inter-cultural context.In this sense, its focus is centered on the educational, social, and political ramifications of music within a community, as well as its power to build bridges between different communities, ideologies, and generations. Practitioners of ethnodoxology seek to use the unique insights that traditional music can offer in the educational, musical, and spiritual realms. In essence, ethnodoxology seeks to look at music from a holistic perspective that takes into account the history, tradition, culture, and context of the people in order to develop an appreciation of the music. This field of study hopes to contribute to cultural dialogue, create bridges between cultures, and foster greater appreciation for the traditional musics of different cultures.",

    " Palasip Qaqqaa (also known as \"mixed boiled meats\" in English) is a traditional Inuit dish typically served on special occasions in the Circum-Arctic region. The dish consists of various meats, including caribou, seal, beluga and Arctic char, boiled in a mixture of water, salt and spices. The cuts of meat are arranged in the pot of water and cooked until the desired level of tenderness is achieved. Palasip Qaqqaa is typically served with special homemade bread called \"Qajaq\" and often accompanied by a variety of jams and fruit. The dish has been an important part of Inuit culture and tradition for centuries, and served, at times, as an important source of sustenance and nutrition in difficult years of food scarcity, when game and fish were scarce. Today, Palasip Qaqqaa is an integral part of many travel experiences in the Arctic, where hunters, fishermen and travelers often enjoy the dish when crossing the region. Many Inuit families still serve the dish for special occasions, usually for weddings and holidays. Furthermore, the dish is served in many restaurants across Canada and Alaska and provides a great opportunity for experiencing authentic Inuit cuisine. Due to its versatile nature and rich history, Palasip Qaqqaa is often used as an example of food sharing and traditional Inuit hospitality. It serves as a reminder of the hospitality and resilience of the Inuit people, who have managed to survive and thrive despite difficult environmental conditions and scarce resources. Palasip Qaqqaa is a unique example of cultural synchronism between Arctic cultures and a reminder of the importance of traditional knowledge and practices among Inuit communities. This dish is still very much alive within the Circum-Arctic region, representing a significant part of Inuit culture, history and identity. ",

    " The Canandaigua Street Railroad was a former streetcar system that operated in the city of Canandaigua, New York between 1895 and 1929. It served to provide transportation to the suburbs and to the city center. The first streetcar of the Canandaigua Street Railroad was built in 1895, after plans to build the streetcar system were approved by the City Council in 1894. The system was initially built as a horse-drawn line and was the first such system in Ontario County. However, the line was soon converted to electric streetcars in 1902.

    " Parr, St Helens is an area of St Helens, Merseyside, England. Located in the northwest of St Helens, it is bordered by the wide expanse of Carr Mill Dam, to the south and part of the Mersey Valley Regional Park. The area in general is made up of smallto-medium sized post-war housing estates and terraces of houses, a large park and the environs of the dam, consisting of small fields and woods. Parr has a well-maintained and popular walkway that loops around the lake and in turn has its own railway station, which serves the nearby locations of Edge Hill and Rainford. The Parr area contains the A57 St Helens Linkway, which stretches from the area in the direction of the neighbouring towns of Huyton, Prescot, and Rainhill. The wider St Helens area was once well connected by passenger rail, however, today only two lines of the old railway network remain operational, the Kirkby Line and the St Helens Loop Line. The Fiddlers Ferry power station is located nearby, situated to the east of Parr which can be seen for miles around. The power station was opened in 1972 and is one of the largest coal-fired power stations in Britain, capable of powering up to 2.3million households. Parr is largely residential and therefore lacks many amenities of its own, however, the neighbouring towns of St Helens, Rainford and Whiston have a number of supermarkets, convenience stores, pubs and restaurants. Parr is served by St Helens North railway station, which causes the area to have easy access to the neighbouring locations of Huyton, Kirkby, Rainford and Rainhill. Parr is an area of high residential density with most households containing either a family or a single occupant. It has been suggested that the area is suffering from deprivation judged by the wide range of income it generates and the housing quality within the area.",
    " Mantis is a genus of the family mantidae containing over 2,400 species of large predatory insects. Mantis belong to a large group of insects within the order Mantodea, typically characterized by a specialized head, legs adapted for gripping prey, segmented body, and remarkable praying behavior. The suborder Mantodea is comprised of many different genera and species, with Mantidae - the mantis family - counting for approximately 80% of all mantodean species. Mantises are widespread and can be found in temperate and tropical habitats around the world. Most species of mantis have a three-stage lifecycle, consisting of egg, nymph and adult stages. Females typically have a mottled brown coloration while males are usually lighter colored with longer and more active wings. During mating, the male typically performs a \"dance\" to entice the female, and the male will often perform acrobatics including somersaults to evade the female's grasp. Mantoideans exhibit a variety of behaviors, including the fascinating praying behavior in which they raise their front legs to appear as if they are in prayer. Their front legs are extremely sensitive and are used to detect nearby prey such as small flies, crickets and other small invertebrates. Thesis are both beneficial and pest species, as they generally feed on other insects. They have been introduced to many areas as a form of natural pest control, and are sometimes used in displays in gardens and zoos. Some species, such as the African Mantis, have become an invasive species in many parts of the world. In addition to its use as a form of pest control, Mantis are also popular as hobbyists. They are generally easy to keep and make an interesting addition to an insect collection. There are even specialized websites devoted to the keeping of mantids and many species of mantis have been bred in captivity. The most commonly available species of mantis are the Chinese Mantis and the European Mantis. They are popular due to their large size, attractive colors, and ease of care. Mantis can make a great addition to any insect enthusiast’s collection and provide a fascinating view into the world of hunting insects. They are a great way to learn about their behavior while also helping provide natural pest control.",
    " Outland (Spear of Destiny album) is the fourth studio album by British post-punk group Spear of Destiny, released in October 1985 by 10 Records. Based on a concept by vocalist and songwriter Kirk Brandon, the album was recorded in six weeks in the summer of 1985 and produced by Steve Hillage. Outland is considered one of Spear of Destiny's most successful albums, garnering critical praise and commercial success. It reached number 13 in the United Kingdom Albums Chart, the most successful chart position of the band's career. Outland yielded two successful singles: \"The Wheel\" and \"Never Take Me Alive\". Writing Honest Tune magazine, Leanne Harding described Outland as \"the most classic example of SOD’s expression of optimism buried beneath gritty realism.\" The album opened with the radio-friendly \"The Wheel\", a song initially intended to be included on the previous album, One Eyed Jacks. The lyrics to \"The Wheel\" were written by Brandon and Lawrence O'Neill, and was accompanied by a promotional film released in 1985. The follow-up single to \"The Wheel\" was the heavy rock single \"Never Take Me Alive.\" Written solely by Brandon, \"Never Take Me Alive\" draws its lyrics from a darker period in Brandon's life, the struggle with the corporate music machine and his alcoholism. Outland continued with a range of cohesive and cuttingly lyrics themes, such as the environment (\"Message From the Bunker\"), religion (\"Love On the Danger Line\"), war (\"In the Cold Wind We Smile\") and reality (\"The Hacker\"). A live version of the single \"The Wheel\" was included as a bonus track at the end of Outland, recorded at The Riviera in Chicago. Outland is considered Spear of Destiny's most successful and best album. Since its release, the album has been regarded as one of the best 1980s post-punk albums.

    " Primate experiments at Columbia University are a form of animal testing done by team at the college's College of Physicians and Surgeons. These tests involve the captive use of monkeys, and many other non-human primates, to study elucidate, and observe the behavior of the animals and its use in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. The experiments have been conducted since the late 1940s and they have provided valuable insights into the behavior of primates and their evolution, as well as the evolution of species as a whole. In recent years, due to public concern and the effort of animal protection campaigners and laboratory animal advocacy, there has been increased focus and scrutiny on animal use in medical research and by Columbia University specifically. The majority of the primate experiments at Columbia University are aimed at understanding how different drugs affect the behavior of primates and their potential use in treating humans. Many studies involve using mouth-swabbing or intravenous injections of various drugs, including hallucinogenic drugs and other psychotropic drugs, to observe how primates react to the effects of these drugs. Other more traditional experiments focus on studying the physical effects of drugs on the animals, such as the possible effects of pain killers or cancer-causing agents, or studying the effects of radiation on the primates. Columbia's primate research center has had difficulty in recent years due to funding issues and difficulty in hiring knowledgeable staff to conduct the experiments. Despite this, the university has committed itself to continue the experiments, citing the importance of the research that it produces. The results of Columbia's experiments have been credited in almost all areas of basic science, including the development of new drugs, psychological theories, neuroscience, and cognitive models. In addition to the important research done at Columbia University, the university is also highly dedicated to the humane treatment of its study animals. The research center staff is comprised of veterinarians and qualified animal technicians who are trained to identify and provide the best possible environment for the animals. Also, in order to minimize the impact of the experiments on the animals, the number of individuals used in each experiment is kept to a minimum. Despite the importance of the research conducted by Columbia University and its commitment to animal welfare, the school has been the target of animal rights activism in recent years. This opposition has been met with a variety of responses from the university and some of its teachers and research staff, including an open debate on the issue of animal testing and a commitment to minimize harm to the animals through proper practices. Overall, the primate experiments conducted at Columbia University continue to provide new and valuable insights into the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and animal behavior. Despite opposition from certain groups, the school and its staff remain committed to conducting the experiments in a safe, humane, and ethical manner.",
    " A hollow fiber bioreactor (HFB) is a type of bioreactor primarily used in biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. It is a system that facilitates the large-scale production of microbial or cell cultures. The primary components of a HFB are hollow fiber membranes that are used to create a sterile environment to grow the culture. The membranes act as a barrier to the outside environment, allowing for efficient filtration of impurities out of the culture. They also help to maintain a favorable environment for efficient growth of the culture. A HFB consists of a cylindrical container divided into two chambers; the exterior and interior chambers. During operation, the exterior chamber is filled with growth medium, and the interior chamber is filled with culture. A pump circulates the medium and culture between the two chambers. Nutrients are constantly added to the growth medium and the cell culture is provided with oxygen for efficient growth. Once the cells are cultured, they can be harvested and used for further applications. The advantage of a HFB is that the waste product of the cells can be removed easily, making it useful in large-scale production. Additionally, a HFB can achieve large-scale production by increasing the population density of the cell culture on the membrane. While most of the HFBs are single layered, some bioreactors combine various layers of hollow fibers. This type of bioreactor is known as a ‘deceptively complex’ system and is used for more specialized processes such as genomic sequencing or gene expression studies. The various layers of fibers provide for precise control over the cell culture environment and allow for different rates of production. Hollow fiber bioreactors are widely used in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries due to their high speed of production, their low energy consumption, and their ability to achieve a high concentration of cells in the culture. The highly efficient filtration provided by the use of hollow fiber membranes, as well as the possibility of precise control over the environment, makes the HFB ideal for various industrial applications.",

As of 2018, 29.6% of New York State's population identified as Hispanic or Latino. This includes individuals of various ancestries, including Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban. Moreover, New York City itself is home to 2.1 million Hispanic or Latino residents, making up 28.6% of its population. The Hispanic population has had a significant presence in New York since at least the mid-19th century. This includes long-established communities of Sephardic Jews in the Lower East Side and various immigrants from what is today Latin America. Through the 20th century, the Hispanic population in New York grew appreciably, as many newcomers arrived from Latin America in search of work. This was especially true after the 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration Act. Since then, the Hispanic population in New York has seen tremendous growth, particularly in places like The Bronx, where 48.5% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. Of the Hispanics and Latinos living in New York, most are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban ancestries. Mexican-American communities are mostly concentrated in areas like Long Island, The Bronx, and Westchester County. Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans, the largest Hispanic demographic, mostly reside in New York City. As a whole, the Hispanic and Latino population is young, with a median age of 28.3 years old, lower than the state's average. Hispanics and Latinos in New York have had a significant influence on the state's culture and economy. Many of the state's large businesses, especially in the retail and hospitality industries, rely heavily on Hispanic or Latino labor. Moreover, Hispanic-American and Latino-American entrepreneurs have had a significant impact on the state's business landscape, especially in the food and fashion sectors. The Hispanic and Latino population in New York has experienced some challenges. Despite contributions that have shaped the culture and economy of the state, Hispanics and Latinos in New York continue to face pressing issues, such as poverty and lack of access to health care and education.

    " Morris Swadesh (1909–1967) was a noted linguist, lexicologist, and anthropologist, who is best remembered for his theoretical and methodological contributions to the field of linguistics. He is widely recognized as the founder of glottochronology, a technique used to estimate the age of related languages. He is also well known for his development of basic word lists used to compare languages and track language divergence. Swadesh was born in the United States, in the now defunct town of Schoenmaker in Wisconsin. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1933, and completed his PhD in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1939. He was first appointed to the Institute for the Study of Man in 1940, where he eventually became the director of research. Swadesh's work pushed forward the field of historical linguistics. He developed the Swadesh List, or the 200 Basic Word List, as a method to compare related languages. Swadesh proposed that languages which shared more words were closer related and had diverged more recently. He also developed the glottochronology method, which allowed linguists to estimate the age of related languages by comparing the percentage of word retention over time. Swadesh also studied dialects and movements of American Indian peoples, particularly in the Great Plains areas. He studied the linguistic aspects of a number of American Indian tribes, gathering significant amounts of information on their languages, which provided an important contribution to Native American language studies.

    " James Hodge Codding (October 18, 1869 - April 16, 1960) was an American minister who was ordained in the Presbyterian Church in 1892 and the most renowned Melanesian missionary. He was born in Verona, New York, and graduated from Hobart College in 1891. After traveling and teaching in the Melanesian Archipelago, he became superintendent and director of the London Missionary Society's South Seas evangelistic enterprise in 1902. He is credited with establishing the foundation for one of the largest and most successful missions in that region. Codding was sent to the South Seas by the London Missionary Society in 1895, where he spent the rest of his life working to bring the Gospel to the heathen over an immense range of islands known as Melanesia. During the span of his ministry in the region he planted over 160 churches and ordained 430 native pastors. He recorded more than one thousand names on his family register. The custom of head-hunting, common among the islanders at the time of Codding's arrival, was replaced by Christian worship services during his time there. He also popularized the phrase \"sons of Solomon\", which became the nickname of the islanders. In recognition of his missionary spirit, Codding was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the University of Edinburgh in 1926 and the Order of the British Empire in 1928. In addition to his Christian message, Codding was a great social reformer and wrote numerous books and articles on Melanesian society. He wrote largely of his trials and tribulations as a missionary and his experiences in the \"island world\" as a form of cultural documentation. His works include: \"Things Seen in the South Seas\" and \"Light in the Islands\". Codding returned to California shortly before his death and is interred in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. He had been a lifelong friend of the Roosevelt family, who attended his funeral. After his death, his widow, Ethel, hired a sculptor to create a bronze statue of Codding in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Codding is remembered today for his pioneering work in the South Seas. He helped to bring the Gospel to the regions of the Pacific islands, establishing educational and medical facilities, building churches and helping to reform island culture. His impact on the region can still be seen today in the islanders’ reverence for Christianity and the deep religious faith they practice. Codding will always be remembered as a great missionary, whose life and work left an indelible mark in the islands he visited.",
    " Albert Burditt (1865–1940) was an American businessman and the founder of Burditt Corporation, an early industrial company which was a major supplier of rubber products for the U.S. Government in the early 20th century. Albert was born in 1865 in Pennsylvania. He received his early education in his native state and from an early age, he demonstrated an aptitude for business. At the age of sixteen, he began working as an apprentice in a small rubber factory, which eventually gave him the experience needed to start his own rubber manufacturing business. By 1888, Albert had established the Burditt Corporation, which specialized in the production of rubber products for government and commercial clients. At first, Burditt's Corporation focused mostly on the production of rubber balls and rubber tires, and this was an integral part of their success. By 1912, Burditt had extended their business to include the manufacture of piping, springs, gaskets, and similar rubber parts. Not only did the company become an important part of the industrial sector in the United States, but it made a great contribution to the war effort in World War I. In addition to the production of rubber and related parts, Burditt also began to provide consulting services to government clients. By then, Burditt had become one of the country's most respected firms in its field. Albert Burditt was a hands-on operator who ran the Burditt business until his death in 1940. He ran a tight ship and insisted on only the very highest standards in production and service. He was dogged in adherence to his principles and often clashed with governmental and other agencies, but he always stayed focused on the production and delivery of quality products. In 1956, Burditt Corporation was acquired by a larger industrial conglomerate, but the company still exists as a shadow of its former self. Nonetheless, Albert Burditt's legacy lives on in the contributions Burditt Corporation made during his tenure as the founder and first CEO. He was a true pioneer in the American industrial sector and a driving force during the early years of growth of the rubber industry. He set a high bar for quality and standards, and these remain hallmarks of the Burditt Corporation today.",
    " Robert Rolle (died 1660) was the leading English lawyer of his day. He was born in Devon, the son of an lawyer, and was educated at Exeter University. He practiced law in the courts of common pleas, the star chamber and King's Bench, and worked with many of the lawyers of his day, including William Noy and Sir Orlando Bridgeman. His legal career was highly successful as he debated and argued on a variety of cases in the most significant court of his time. He appeared in many of the leading cases, including the Somersett case, which granted freedom to a particular slave affirming his rights to life, liberty, and possession of property. At the time, England was governed by the monarchy of King Charles I, who had the deciding power and influence in the court proceedings. Prosecutors of the time had absolute power to make a case against a defendant and would often arbitrarily refuse to accept a plea or settlement from a defendant. Rolle was seen by many as a good role model for a fair-minded lawyer and challenged the prosecution's arbitrary decisions in court. As his influence spread, King Charles appointed him as counsel to the navy, a position he held until his death in 1660. Although Rolle was criticized for his legal decisions, he stood out in his network of friends and colleagues. He was known to be supportive of civil liberties and never lost sight of the equality he found in natural law. He was very highly respected by the English legal system and stands out as a significant figure in the development of English law. Rolle's work continues to influence the development of English law. Numerous books and articles have been written in his honour, and various foundations and trusts have been set up in his name. In the end, Robert Rolle was a respected lawyer, a proponent of justice, and a leader in the advancement of English law. He will forever be remembered for his contribution to the development of a fair and legal system in England.",

    " The 1984 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise's 25th season in the National Football League and the 15th under head coach Kay Stephenson. The Bills had a 7-9 record and failed to make the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. Their 7-4 record through 11 games was their best since 1976, and had them in playoff contention entering December. However, 3 losses in their final 4 games, including a 15-13 loss to the Green Bay Packers in the season finale left the team at 7-9 and one game out of the playoffs. The offense was led by quarterback Joe Ferguson who threw for a career-high 3,043 yards, 22 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. He was backed up by rookies Matt Kofler and Mark Stevens, who shared duties playing backup. The team's leading rusher was Larry Mason who carried the ball 234 times for 705 yards and 5 touchdowns. Top receiving targets for Ferguson were Elbert \"Ickey\" Woods with 43 receptions for 449 yards and 8 touchdowns, and rookie wide receiver Ernest Givins who caught 41 passes for 545 yards and 6 touchdowns while earning Pro Bowl honors. On defense, the Bills ranked 12th in the league, allowing 339.2 yards of total offense per game, while recording 33 sacks and 27 interceptions. Second-year defensive end Bruce Smith was named to the Pro Bowl, leading the team with 14 sacks and earning Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1983. The Bills also returned both kickers from the 1983 season, punter Chris Mohr and kicker Scott Norwood. Norwood made 16 field goals and 21 extra points for 69 total points. The Bills opened the season on September 3, 1984 with a win at the New York Jets, 10-7. This was their first win versus the Jets since the 1980 season. They would later lose to the Jets in the season finale, 15-13. Other highlights of the season included a 34-3 home victory against the St. Louis Cardinals, and a 17-13 victory over the Chicago Bears, which was the Bills' first win against the Bears since 1975. The Bills finished the 1984 season 7-9, a improvement over their 4-12 finish the year before. The team failed to make the playoffs, finishing one game behind the 8-8 Miami Dolphins who earned the last Wild Card spot. Despite their promising mid-season record, the Bills went winless in their final 4 games, ending their season on a sour note. Despite the disappointing finish, the Bills showed promise as they began to form the nucleus of what would be one of the most successful teams in the late 80's and early 90's.

    " Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan and one of the most populous cities in the world. With a rich history spanning centuries, Karachi has been the economic capital of Pakistan since independence from the British in 1947. The roots of Karachi go back to the ancient city of Kolachi, located on the coast of the Arabian Sea in Sindh province. Kolachi is said to have been founded in 1729 when various Balochi, Pashtun, and Omani settlers first made the land their home. The city remained in relative obscurity until the British colonization of India in 1839, when it was developed and modernized by the British and became the principal trading port of British India. In 1901, the old city of Kolachi was incorporated into the larger Municipality of Karachi, which was established by the British. This marked the beginning of large-scale urbanization of the city, with the creation of grand public parks, modern architecture, and public institutions. From this point, Karachi began to grow rapidly, becoming the center of politics, industry, and commerce in the newly formed nation of Pakistan after the partition of British India in 1947. During the 1940s and '50s, Karachi witnessed one of its most prosperous periods under the rule of its first mayor, Seth Harchandrai Vishandas. He implemented various long-term economic and social development projects such as reorganizing Banarasi Bazaar, building new parks, and introducing a number of factories in the city. This helped Karachi to enter an era of spectacular economic and population growth. Karachi has experienced a wide range of political upheavals over the years, from sectarian riots in the 1980s to a decades-long military operation by the Pakistani army against Taliban insurgents, which was initiated in 2014. Despite the many challenges, the economic and social progress of the city continues and is being further embellished by the initiatives of the current mayor, Wasim Akhtar. In recent decades, Karachi has emerged as one of the most important cities in South Asia, serving as the commercial and financial hub of Pakistan. As of 2019, Karachi is the second-most populous city in the world, with an estimated 20 million people. It is also a major transport and industrial center with a large international seaport and a modern international airport. The city continues to embark on a journey of development, encompassing many public and private projects with the aim of achieving an even better standard of living for its inhabitants. The future of Karachi undoubtedly looks bright.",

    " Amolops archotaphus is a species of frog in the Ranidae family of frogs. It is endemic to the Sichuan Basin, China. It is known commonly as the Archotaphetic Frog. The adult males of this species range from 31-49mm in snout-vent length. The species is distinguished from the European frogs of its genus by its small size and its color. The body of the frogs is dorsal surface is brownish-black in colour and their ventral surface is whitish. They have a greyish canthal stripe and there are black patches behind the eyes. The legs are pale brown or pink with darker spots. Amolops archotaphus is found in the Sichuan Province of China near streams, ponds, paddy fields, and gardens with vegetation. The species is generally found in grasslands, but is also known from higher elevations. The breeding sites of Amolops archotaphus are the shallow streams and ponds that are found in the Sichuan Basin. The frogs often lay their eggs among vegetation and the eggs click when touched. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles emerge in mid-summer and take around two weeks to transform into froglets. The diet of Amolops archotaphus consists of a variety of small insects and arthropods including crickets, ants, and spiders. The species has also been observed to feed on other small vertebrates such as fish and small frogs. Amolops archotaphus is listed as a Near Threatened species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and is also listed in CITES Appendix II. The primary threats to the species is habitat destruction due to agricultural activities and development. Pollution is also known to be a common threat to the species. In order to protect the species, the Chinese government has taken several steps, such as establishing local Govt. nature reserves to protect the species and its habitat. In addition, public awareness campaigns have been launched to educate the locals regarding conservation of the species.",

    " Nepal–Spain relations refers to the bilateral relations between Nepal and Spain. Relations between the two countries have been mainly warm and friendly. History Spain had some indirect involvement in the history of Nepal in the 18th century, when diplomats from the court of Nepal's ruling Shah dynasty were dispatched first to St. Petersburg, then to Madrid, to infom the Spanish government about Nepal's presence and to seek Spanish recognition of the Shah rule (as opposed to the monarchy's traditional tributary relationship to China). In the modern times, formal diplomatic relations between Nepal and Spain were established on May 16, 1964. Since then, exchanges in various fields have taken place on a regular scale. In June 1996, King Birendra of Nepal made a state visit to Spain at the invitation of then King Juan Carlos. During this visit, a joint communique was issued expressing commitment to the strengthening of sound friendly and cooperative bilateral relations between the two countries. Diplomatic mission Nepal and Spain enjoyed full diplomatic relations since the establishment of Embassy of Nepal in Madrid in 1982, which is currently headed by Hon. Rabindra Nath Shrestha as the Ambassador of Nepal. On the other hand, Spain established its embassy in Kathmandu in 2004 and the Spanish Ambassador to Nepal is currently Hon. Juan Francisco Amador Carranza. Cooperation In 2011, Spanish government provided technical assistance for the infrastructure development of projects such as airports and bridges in Nepal. Germany, United Kingdom and Spain have undertaken 1 Eco-Development project in the Annapurna Conservation Area in western Nepal. The Spanish Government is also coordinating particularly with the AECID-funded projects in Nepal to improve their economic and social development. The two countries have also established an effective mechanism of cooperation in the field of science and technology. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research of Nepal and Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development (AECID) in 2062 for cooperation in the field of science and technology. In April 2013, Embassy of Spain in Nepal and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment of Nepal jointly launched the Spanish-Nepal Climate Change Project to support the development of adaptation strategies and climate models for Nepal. Cultural exchange The two countries engage in significant cultural exchanges. In 1976, Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) and its Spanish counterpart signed an agreement for establishing and promoting friendship, understanding and cooperation between the two Chambers. In December 2003, a Nepalese-Spanish Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in Nepal and currently undertake activities such as organizing exchange programs, organizing joint venture activities, and offering study grants to Spanish students in Nepal. The Embassy of Spain in Nepal and Spanish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (AECID) launched the 2009-2012 Spanish-Nepal Cultural Exchange Program to foster exchange in the field of massmedia, arts, education and sciences. In April, 2012, Embassy of Spain in Kathmandu hosted a function to celebrate the II Nepal-Spain Cultural Week.

    " John Franklin Enders (1897-1985) was an esteemed American scientist and Nobel Prize laureate who made lasting contributions to the fields of chemistry, virology, immunology, and biochemistry. Born in West Hartford, Connecticut in 1897, Enders had a long and distinguished career in his fields of expertise, achieving important breakthroughs in both the chemistry and virology-related fields of science. While attending Yale University, Enders fell in love with chemistry and decided to pursue it as a full-time career. After graduating in 1918 he went on to the Harvard University where he received his Ph.D in Chemistry in 1924. In his Ph.D dissertation, Enders laid the groundwork for research into the structure of proteins which he later developed while working in the department of physical chemistry at Harvard. In addition to his work in chemistry, Enders became a pioneer in the field of virology. His most famous achievement was the development of the so-called \"Enders-Edmonston-Litzman Boston Vaccine” for measles. Enders's work led to a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine shared with Thomas H. Weller and Frederick Robbins in 1954 for \"discovering and isolating the active virus strains that cause measles, mumps, and chicken pox.\" Enders also made valuable contributions to the field of immunology, particularly through the development of the MIT Vacuoles Test, an early form of the modern ELISA test. This test was used to diagnose multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Throughout his career, Enders was involved in various research projects both directly and indirectly.

    " She Used to Be Mine is a song by American recording artist Sara Bareilles from her fifth studio album, What’s Inside: Songs from Waitress. Written and produced by Bareilles, it was released as a single in the United States on October 6, 2015, after teasing the song on Twitter a few days prior. Moreover, it became the theme song of the stage musical based on the 2007 film Waitress, for which Bareilles wrote all of the songs. The song is an emotional ballad, in which Bareilles reflects on her memories, regrets, and life with mixed feelings. She also describes the \"monsters\" and \"demons\" that reside within her trying to take over her life, and make it unrecognizable. She Used to Be Mine expresses feelings of sorrow and regret, and its lyrics focus on how someone becomes a “shadow of their former self” and how they are “losing control” of the situation and the “dreams they had before.” The music video for She Used to Be Mine was released October 26, 2015, and features Bareilles performing the song on a black and white stage. As she sings, glitching special effects are used to illustrate her emotional turmoil. The video has since amassed over 39 million views on YouTube as of October 2019. Reception of the single has been generally positive. Allmusic described it as a “heartfelt” song and praised its “intensely personal lyrics” and “catchy melody.” Rolling Stone similarly called it “a somber ballad” and noted that the lyrics were “filled with vulnerability.” Entertainment Weekly also praised the song’s “yearning” and “emotionally charged” vocals. At the 2016 Tony Awards, She Used to Be Mine was highlighted by lead actress Jessie Mueller, who won Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical. Mueller and Bareilles performed a duet of the song, as a tribute to the musical Waitress. The song was also included on the 2017 Waitress (Deluxe) compilation album. In addition, She Used to Be Mine became a popular karaoke song. Its mellow sound, combined with its relatable and heart-warming lyrics, made it ideal for singing with friends and family.

    " Fat Man and Little Boy are two supporting characters featured in the animated television sitcom The Simpsons. They appear as recurring characters in the show and are voiced by the show's creator, Matt Groening. The characters first appeared in the episode \"Treehouse of Horror II\" from season 3 of the show. In this episode, Fat Man and Little Boy were two atomic bomb technicians, who were assigned with the task of transporting the bombs Little Boy and Fat Man for the Manhattan Project. However, the two scientists were not aware of the destructive power of the bombs and instead played a game of catch with them in Springfield while Homer Simpson was unable to stop them. In the end, the bombs exploded and caused massive destruction in the town, as well as creating a nuclear fallout cloud over it. In subsequent episodes, Fat Man and Little Boy retain their roles as scientists who transport dangerous objects of unknown power. However, their appearances vary widely, depending on the situation. In the episodes \"Homer the Smithers\" and \"Trash of the Titans\", they are shown as janitors working in Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, while in the episode \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" they are shown as customers in a store, buying an electric guitar. In addition to their roles in the show, Fat Man and Little Boy have become popular icons of The Simpsons, becoming frequent references in popular culture and parodies of the show. They have been featured in a number of merchandise as well, such as action figures, trading cards and T-shirts. There are even fan websites devoted to them and their catchphrase, \"Ohhh!

    " Lund v Boissoin is a court case in Alberta, Canada, that resulted in a ruling regarding the limits of free speech in relation to issues of homosexuality. It was centred around a complaint filed by University of Alberta student Tracy Lund against Stephen Boissoin, a fundamentalist Christian pastor, who wrote a letter containing anti-gay views which was published in the Red Deer Advocate in 2002. The complaint alleged that Boissoin had violated Alberta’s then Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act by publishing the letter in the newspaper. The Canadian Constitution Foundation, a group representing conservative values, supported Boissoin's case. In June 2003, the Alberta Human Rights Commission upheld the complaint, finding that Boissoin’s letter was discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation and made its ruling by stating that Boissoin was to cease publishing in newspapers, acknowledge his mistake in a full-page advertisement, pay Lund C$5,000 in costs and C$5,000 as compensation for injury to her dignity, feelings and self-respect. The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta heard arguments regarding the case in March 2008 and rendered its decision two months later. The court held that portions of the Human Rights Commission’s ruling were in error and that the Commission “crossed the line and ignored some basic tenets of Charter protection of expressive activity in writing and publishing the remedy it imposed.”. In the following November, the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the Court of Queen's Bench decision. As a result of Lund v Boissoin, it had been argued by some that Alberta's human rights legislation is unconstitutional and has violated democratic values concerning the right to free speech. However, in the ruling from higher court, it was concluded that free speech shouldn't be absolute under any situation and should be subject to restrictions. The ruling was perceived by some to have supported or affirmed the right of individuals to express their religious beliefs while protecting the rights of individuals from the harm caused by such beliefs. Since the ruling, this case has become a significant example of the struggle for religious freedom and the limitations of free speech in Canada. It serves as an example of how Canadians are attempting to balance their rights with respect to free speech and with respect to public expression of their religious beliefs. The ruling in this case also touched on how the Canadian concept of fundamental freedoms is being applied to its citizens. The court suggested that governments should be careful when imposing limits on speech, arguing that citizens should be allowed to express ideas and beliefs that may be considered disagreeable or offensive, as long they do not lead to harm. This decision could have implications for Canadian law going forward regarding how Canadians are allowed to express their personal religious beliefs and opinions.",

    " Prasophyllum mimulum, commonly known as the small Prasophylum, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is a terrestrial herb, growing up to 10 cm in height, with several leaves and a single, white flower. The flower has a noticeable mid-lobe, two lateral lobes, a dorsal sepal and two lateral petals. It is found in wet and dry sclerophyll forests, and is distributed throughout south-eastern Australia, from Victoria and New South Wales to Tasmania. The species epithet mimulum is derived from Latin, meaning \"small resemblance\". The flowers of Prasophyllum mimulum are easily recognised due to their small size. Prasophyllum mimulum is an obligate outcrosser and requires cross-pollination for successful seed-set. Pollination is carried out by a variety of bees, including large carpenter bees and small flower-visiting bees. As the flowers open, the lower labellum curls down to a horizontal position, providing a platform for the pollinator resting. The species is listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is threatened by a number of factors, including the alteration of fire regimes and the impact of invasive weeds and feral animals. However, its presence across much of south-eastern Australia may indicate that it is resilient to some extent. The species is likely to experience increased pressure from climate change and urban development. Some populations have become fragmented, reducing the number of pollinators, as well as genetic flow between populations. It is likely to need targeted conservation management and monitoring to ensure population resilience in the future. Prasophyllum mimulum is an attractive species and is popular amongst orchid enthusiasts. It can be propagated vegetatively from clumps or from seed and is easy to maintain in cultivation. It does best in well-draining, acidic soil, with plenty of air-flow and in partial shade. (Word count: 268)",
    " John Anthony West (1932 - 2018) was an American author and Egyptologist best known for his seminal works on ancient Egypt and its civilization. He is best known for introducing a radical revision in conventional Egyptology, most prominently the suggestion that the Great Sphinx of Giza may in fact be thousands of years older than previously thought. West was born in 1932 in Mineola, New York and earned a B.A. in Fine Arts from Columbia University. He went on to pursue graduate studies at the University of Geneva and Oxford University, but chose not to receive a degree. He then crafted a career as a poet, screenwriter, journalist, and painter. West's interest in Egyptology was first piqued during a childhood visit to the Middle East with his father. Over the years this interest grew, and ultimately formed the basis of his writing and research. In 1979, West presented \"The Case for the Great Sphinx\", a documentary that argued the sphinx might in fact be thousands of years older than the traditional dates assigned by Egyptologists. This presented a radical departure from the traditional understanding of the sphinx, and attracted the attention of Robert Bauval, whose Orion Correlation Theory West drew on to support his conclusions. In the late 1980s, West organized two exploratory visits to the pyramid complex of Giza. During these visits, West and his team of experts uncovered evidence that further supported his findings. The theory of West and his colleagues also drew the attention of some of the world's leading Egyptologists. While some of the findings of West and his team were further explored by Egyptologists, others were dismissed. Nonetheless, his work is still considered groundbreaking and significantly influenced many later studies on ancient Egypt. West continued to write, eventually authoring several books on the subject of Egyptology. His last book, 'Serpent in the Sky', was published in 1993, and explores an alternative explanation for the origin of civilization. West died in 2018 at the age of 85, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking work in Egyptology. His work has inspired others to push the boundaries of conventional Egyptology, introducing new theories and revising the traditional understanding of this ancient civilization.",
    " Cranbrook is an Anglican Church hymn tune composed by William Henry Monk in 1861. It is best known for its use with the lyrics of \"Fairest Lord Jesus\", one of the most beloved Christian hymns with both Catholic and Protestant roots. The tune was named after Cranbrook, a town in Kent, England. The hymn was first published in Monk's book Hymns Ancient and Modern, which was released in 1861. The original version is scored for SATB choir, and while Monk wrote two accompaniment options - organ and harmonium - the organ version is generally preferred due to its fuller sound. The organ version was first featured in the 1861 edition of the English Hymnal. \"Fairest Lord Jesus\" is one of the oldest surviving Christian hymns, having been sung in German as early as the 13th century. The English lyrics were first published in 1752, and a number of tunes have been written for it, many more recently than Cranbrook, such as Mark Hayes' \"Lorraine\". Though Cranbrook is now most widely associated with \"Fairest Lord Jesus\", it was originally written for the hymn \"Tell Out, My Soul\". The lyrics of this hymn have also been revised over time, first by Robert Robinson who contributed the first three verses in 1776. Regarding its popularity, Cranbrook remains one of the most widely used hymn tunes in churches around the world. It has been featured in many hymn books, including the Trinity Hymnal, the 1940 Methodist Hymnal, and the Contemporary Christian Music Project. In addition, Cranbrook is often used as a processional and recessional hymn at Christian weddings. It has also been featured on recordings by a number of contemporary Christian artists, including Josh Groban, Amy Grant, and Chris Tomlin. Cranbrook remains one of the most beloved Christian hymns of all time. Its simple melody and timeless lyrics still touch hearts and evoke deep emotions over one hundred and fifty years since its original composition.",

    " Gun laws in Georgia are among the more permissive in the United States and have become increasingly so since the late 1960s. Georgia does not require a permit to openly carry a firearm, and constitutional carry, which allows for the concealed carry of a firearm without a permit, is legal in most areas of the state. However, carrying a concealed firearm in certain areas, such as schools and government buildings, is still prohibited. History The laws surrounding firearms in Georgia have evolved over the years. Until 1967, it was illegal to carry a firearm in public without a permit from the state. This changed in 1967 when a new statute allowed citizens to openly carry firearms without a permit. In Florida v. J.L. (2000), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that law enforcement could not search a person suspected of carrying a firearm without first establishing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. This ruling provided additional protection for Georgia gun owners and largely removed restrictions on firearm possession and usage. Concealed Carry In 2014, Georgia passed a law that allows citizens to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. This is referred to as constitutional carry. This law does not apply in some areas including restaurants that serve alcohol, government buildings, and places of worship. As of 2019, there are still restrictions on the carrying of firearms on college campuses, although a bill has been proposed to allow it. Stand-Your-Ground Georgia is a Stand-Your-Ground state where citizens may use deadly force to defend themselves or their property in certain circumstances. For a stand-your-ground defense to be successful, the person claiming self-defense must be in a place they have a right to be and they must not have provoked the assault or be involved in criminal activity. Open Carry Open carry is legal in Georgia without any kind of permit or license. While it is not illegal to openly carry a firearm, it is recommended to carry a permit with you in order to avoid any potential confusion with law enforcement. Municipal Laws While there are no statewide restrictions on the possession of firearms, some municipalities have passed their own laws establishing additional restrictions. For example, in the City of Atlanta it is illegal to carry a firearm, either openly or concealed, without the proper permit. It is important to check with local laws before carrying a firearm in Georgia. Conclusion Overall, the gun laws in Georgia are among the more lenient in the United States. Citizens are allowed to openly carry firearms without a permit, and concealed carry can be done with a permit or through constitutional carry. There are still some restrictions on concealed carry in certain areas, as well as local laws that can affect firearm possession and usage.",

    " The Battle of Reims, fought on 13–14 March 1814, was an important engagement of the Napoleonic Wars. It was an Allied victory that effectively ended any hope of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte remaining atop the French throne. The battle pitted the garrisons at Reims and their surroundings under the command of Jean-Jacques Ambert against a superior force of 22,000 men and sixty-four guns of the Sixth Coalition commanded by Prince Blücher. The fighting took place in and around the city of Reims, located in modern-day France. The Sixth Coalition consisted of troops from Prussia, Austria, Württemberg, Bavaria, and Russia, while the French forces numbered around 17,000 men and forty guns. Blücher deployed his troops in a modified formation that created a defensive circle around the city, intending to hold fast to the superior firepower of their artillery. On the other hand, the French used a concentration of men and guns, hoping to break through the Allied lines. The battle began on the morning of 13 March with an attack by the French forces against the Allies’ northern flank. The attack was repelled, but the Allies' defensive circle was breached in the east, allowing the French to advance into the city. Despite a desperate counter-attack, the French managed to maintain their momentum and fought their way further into Reims. After a night of desperate fighting, and no further gains for the French, Blücher ordered a retreat. The retreat was executed and the French, exhausted from the previous days fighting, were unable to stop it. The Battle of Reims ended in an Allied victory. Approximately 11,000 French troops were taken prisoner, along with forty guns. Additionally, numerous ammunition and provisions were captured by the Allies. On the other side, Allied losses totaled around 5,400 men, including two generals and thirty guns. The Battle of Reims was a decisive victory for the Sixth Coalition and marked a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars. Afterward, Napoleon's hold on Europe began to unravel and the Allies began their advance into France. The fall of Reims was the first step in the Allies' march to an eventual victory at the Battle of Waterloo.",
    " The 1973 Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council election took place on 3 May 1973 to elect members of Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council in Merseyside, England. This election was held on the same day as other local elections. The Labour Party won most seats, gaining five from the Conservatives. While Labour increased their majority on the council, overall the Conservatives gained more seats than Labour from the previous election and actually gained two more councillors than Labour, having 16 councillors to Labour's 14. The Liberal Party also gained one councillor. The electoral wards used for the 1973 election were the same as those decided in a 1968 boundary review. All wards were single-member. As a result of the election, the composition of the council was: * Labour: 14 * Conservative: 16 * Independent: 1 The election was the first in Wirral since the creation of the Metropolitan Borough in April 1974. Previously, members served on Birkenhead Borough Council (established 1877), Wallasey Borough Council (1900) and Hoylake Urban District Council (1889). Turnout in the election was over 48%. The results of the 1973 election had the potential to shake-up council leadership, as the Labour majority could controversially be repealed. The first mayor of Wirral was Alderman David Goldie, who was elected at the council's inaugural meeting following the election. After the election, a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed. The proposal was forged by Bruce Ishikawa, the newly elected Conservative councillor for the Heswall ward. Despite the council's previous majority under Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came into power citing the need for greater cooperation between the groups. At the council's inaugural meeting Labour abstained from voting on the arrangement, with Labour councillor Mary Dunn expressing the party's disappointment that there was no real joint government between the two parties. The coalition government lasted until the 1977 local election, where Labour regained the majority on the council. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition was dubbed the \"Mission Impossible\" government due to its unorthodox ruling of a Labour-majority council.

The Pawnee have a long history of leadership and authority, traced back to the mid-14th century. The Pawnee were actively trading with Europeans throughout the late 17th and early 18th centuries, at which time the chiefs held nearly all the political power within their society. The Pawnee Chief had several duties and responsibilities. They served as the spiritual leaders of their people, as well as the political leaders.

    ". Jiří Wolker (18 February 1896 – 28 December 1924) was a Czech poet, journalist, playwright and revolutionary. He was one of the leading figures of the Czech avant-garde in the early 20th century, and one of the most influential Czech poets of the interwar period. Wolker was born into a Jewish middle-class family in the small town of Sedlčany. As a student in Prague, he became involved in revolutionary activities; he was imprisoned for a year for his involvement in the The Workers’ Sport International and the Young Czech Social-Democrats. This experience shaped his social and political views, which he expressed through his writing. Writing became his passion, and he wrote hundreds of poems, plays, and essays over the course of his short life. Wolker's best-known works include his poem \"The Ballad of Young Heřman\", which tells of a man who gives up his life in a fight against gendarmes to save his friend, and \"Thoughts on Life and Death\". He also wrote many plays, including The Provincial Robbers and The Knife Maker. His poetry was notable for its rhythmic, passionate expression of love, loss, and struggle. He was deeply influenced by the Czech folklore of his youth and by romanticism, but his works also echoed the disillusionment of the avant-garde; his themes were often dark and macabre. Though he achieved fame during his lifetime, he died in poverty in 1924 at the age of 28, having been struck by a deadly form of tuberculosis. His death, both tragic and untimely, caused a great shock in the Czech Literary community. Today, he is remembered as an inspiration to writers and poets, and as one of the most original figures of the Czech avant-garde. His writings continue to be influential in the Czech Republic, and in 2010 he was commemorated with an exhibition in Prague.",

    " Turning the other cheek is one of the most recognized and important teachings of Christianity and as such has been quoted by many prominent figures and theologians throughout history. It is a concept full of complex spiritual implications, and exemplifies one of the most powerful and fundamental Christian values. The phrase first appears in the New Testament of the Bible in a passage from the Sermon on the Mount, which is attributed to the words of Jesus. It reads: \"You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" (NIV, Matthew 5:38-39) The phrase \"turning the other cheek\" has been interpreted in many ways over the years. Broadly speaking, it refers to the idea of \"forgiveness\" in the face of hurt, injustice, and oppression. It suggests we should not retaliate when faced with evil and injustice, but instead, we should find it in our hearts to show compassion and understanding. Turning the other cheek is seen as a much more meaningful and effective response than a violent reaction which can only lead to more hurt and violence. By responding without violence, Christians can take a moral stand and exemplify their faith while standing up to evil. In the modern world, the concept of turning the other cheek has become the standard for compassionate and responsible behavior, and is a crucial part of living a meaningful and peaceful life. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader in the civil rights movement, often spoke of the importance of turning the other cheek, where he stated \"We must love our white brothers, no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out across the centuries, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you'.\" Turning the other cheek is more than just an example of kindness and compassion, it is an example of strength and courage that stands in the face of evil and oppression. It reminds us that we can reclaim our power and self-esteem, and prevent future hurt, by responding peacefully and thoughtfully in the face of danger or mistreatment. It helps us to look beyond our own needs and see the needs of others, and act in the best interest of all. In summary, turning the other cheek is one of the most significant teachings in Christianity, where it carries the powerful message to rise above injustice and to not allow hurt and violence beget more hurt and violence. It is an example of responding with compassion, and of reclaiming our power by responding peacefully and thoughtfully in the face of evil.",

    " An organoiodine compound is a chemical compound composed of organic compound and iodine. These compounds are commonly used in synthetic organic chemistry, particularly in the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and synthetic dyes. Organoiodine compounds are often used as reagents and catalysts due to their unique reactivity and stability. Organoiodine compounds can be further divided into two categories, iolynating agents and iodinating agents. Iolynating agents are compounds that are capable of adding iodine to an existing carbon-carbon bond. These compounds can also be referred to as iodoalkene precursors. Iodinating agents are compounds that produce organoiodine compounds by the addition of iodine to an existing carbon-carbon bond. Organoiodine compounds can be synthesized in a variety of ways depending on the application. One popular method of synthesis is through iodine-catalyzed add-on reactions. These reactions take place when an iodinating agent, such as iodobenzene, reacts with a carbon-hydrogen bond in order to form an organoiodine compound. Other methods of synthesis include the use of iodine-stabilized ylides, iodine thiolates, 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and organoiodinium salts. Organoiodine compounds are known to be toxic and should be handled with care. Exposure to organoiodine compounds can result in irritation of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. In addition, prolonged exposure to certain organoiodine compounds has been known to cause thyroid gland damage, as well as, neurological and reproductive damage. Organoiodine compounds have a wide range of applications. Organoiodine compounds are widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and synthetic dyes. In addition, they can also be used as reagents and catalysts in a variety of organic reactions. Lastly, organoiodine compounds can be used to produce highly water-soluble iodine species, which are utilized in biological and DNA labeling. Overall, organoiodine compounds are an important class of compounds that are used in many applications. They are known to be toxic and should be handled with care. It is important to be aware of the potential health risks of exposure. With proper handling, organoiodine compounds can be used safely and effectively.",
    " The 1993 Western Australian state election was the worst electoral defeat for the Labor Party since its victory in 1911, and the best result it had ever achieved for the Liberal-National coalition. The election was held on Saturday, 6 February 1993 and was for all 58 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The incumbent Labor government, led by Carmen Lawrence, had been in power since 1989. The state had become embroiled in two very public health scandals, and Lawrence was seen as lacking the strong leadership needed to get the state out of them. The government also found itself in a precarious financial position, with its deficit expected to balloon to $3.3 billion by the end of 1993. At the election, the Liberal and National parties, led by Richard Court, campaigned on the promise of an economic reform agenda. They also supported the privatization of public organizations, a move that had been partly reversed in recent years. The Liberal and National parties won a landslide victory, winning 39 of the 58 seats on a primary vote of 55.7%. This was an increase of 17 seats over their performance at the 1989 election. Labor's primary vote fell from 43.8% to 34.3%, and the party won just 19 seats. The Australian Democrats, who had won one seat in 1989, failed to win any in 1993. The Liberal-National Coalition was sworn in as the new government on 7 March 1993. Richard Court was elected as the first Liberal premier of Western Australia since 1983. The landslide victory marked the beginning of an unprecedented period of economic reform for the state. The state Labor Party was led by two different leaders in the months following the election. Geoff Gallop replaced Lawrence as leader in June 1994, and in February 1996, Jim McGinty was elected state leader. The government was particularly focused on improving the state's economy, providing incentives to business and eliminating bureaucracy. The Liberal-National Coalition remained in power at the 1996, 2001 and 2005 elections. Yet the 1993 election ultimately marked a dramatic shift in the state's politics, with the new Coalition government introducing dramatic and far-reaching reforms to the state's economy.",

Musgrave was drafted in the 13th round of the 2011 MLB draft by the Rockies out of West Virginia University. Musgrave made his major league debut for the Rockies on May 30th, 2017 against the Philadelphia Phillies, pitching 5 innings, giving up 3 earned runs, striking out 4 batters and getting the no-decision. Musgrave has split his time between the Majors and Triple-A since his 2017 debut. In 2018, while pitching for the Isotopes (Triple-A), he was selected to represent the Rockies in the Triple-A All Star Game. His 2019 season was cut short due to injury and he underwent corrective surgery on his throwing elbow to repair nerve damage. Before playing two season in the Majors, Musgrave spent most of his career in the minor leagues and in Independent leagues, playing for teams such as the Ogden Raptors and the Long Island Ducks. Musgrave is known for throwing a sinker, four-seam fastball, slider, and a rarely used cutter. He uses the sinker and fastball heavily, usually accompanied by a slider to the opposite batter, who he believes can hit the slider better than the sinker. Off the field, Harrison Musgrave is an avid outdoorsman and loves to hunt and fish. He is a Pennsylvania native, and credits much of his success to growing up with a strong work ethic instilled in him by his parents.

    " An air-gap flash is a form of solid state storage device which has a wide array of uses in computing, especially in embedded systems. It is a form of flash storage, but with a key difference in design. Unlike a traditional flash drive, which is attached directly to the circuit board via a USB port or other form of connection, the air-gap flash is designed to be 'air-gapped.' This means that the storage media is installed without being directly connected to any computer boards, instead the device receives power solely by a battery or other external means. An air-gap flash has the advantages of higher read/write speeds and greater durability than traditional flash drives. It also offers increased data safety and improved performance in hazardous or mission critical environments. Because it is air gapped, an air-gap flash also has the ability to resist physical tampering and electrical interference from outside sources. Air-gap flash is found in a variety of applications in both home and business computing settings. It is especially suited to industrial settings, where physical tampering or electromagnetic interference from other pieces of equipment can be fatal to the workings of the system. In addition to the obvious technological benefits, the device can also provide cost benefits over traditional storage solutions, due to its increased durability and reliability. Air-gap flash is usually divided into two distinct form factors. The first type is a form factor referred to as a 'self-powered' design, which is housed in its own casing and supplied with its own power. This type is used in traffic lights, medical pieces of equipment and military settings. The second type is called ' externally-powered', and supports a much wider range of applications. This type has the ability to be powered by other pieces of equipment, allowing for greater flexibility. The main drawback of an air-gap flash is the cost of installation, as the device requires installation in a case or on a circuit board, which can be expensive for larger applications. Additionally, the lack of direct connection to the circuit board increases the possibility of data loss due to disk damage. Despite these drawbacks air-gap flash is becoming increasingly popular due to its durability, performance and data safety benefits.",

Orangeback fairy-wrasse are found near reefs, primarily in shallower waters where they feed on a variety of benthic organisms and small fish. These fish are social and often form small schools that find forage together. They can be territorial and will establish small domains within a reef, but are typically peaceful with their own species. Orangeback fairy-wrasse are an easy species to keep in the home aquarium. These fish prefer tanks with plenty of live rock, caves, and plenty of open space to swim. They can be kept singly or in small groups and should always be provided with plenty of cover. The ideal water temperature for this species is between 76-78°F. When Orangeback fairy-wrasse are kept in pairs or even small groups in the aquarium, they may form strong bonds. Captive specimens will often form fascinating courtship displays and color changes. When housed with conspecifics, these wrasses are most active and exhibit their most exciting behaviors. It is important to note that individuals from this species may sometimes become aggressive towards other fish, especially if they are of the same species. Orangeback fairy-wrasse are an excellent choice for aquariums of all sizes, from nano aquariums to larger aquariums. They are a beautiful addition to any tank and will provide hours of fun and fascination. With proper care and attention, these fish can live up to 10-15 years in captivity.",

    " The Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of Southeast Asia. The ecoregion includes the montane rain forests of Mizoram and Manipur States of India, and Sagaing Region, south Kachin, and northern Chin States in Myanmar. These forests cover an area of 25,811 square kilometers (9,983 square miles). The climate is monsoonal, with high humidity and rainfall. Temperatures range from 16–26 °C (61–79 °F), and mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,800–2,400 mm (70–94 in). The ecoregion's flora includes species such as trees of the Fagaceae (especially Bombax ceiba) and Lauraceae (Gomphandra arborea and Machilus odoratissima) families, as well as evergreen trees such as Castanopsis tribuloides, Holigarna arnottiana, Microglossa lomatophylla, and Quercus spp. Lianas, palms and bamboos are also prevalent. The fauna is comprised of a variety of species including mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Mammals such as Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) and gaurs (Bos gaurus) inhabit the forests of Mizoram and Manipur, while species such as red pandas (Ailurus fulgens), Himalayan tahrs (Hemitragus jemlahicus), and serow (Capricornis sumatraensis) inhabit the forests of Kachin. The endangered pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) is also found in the ecoregion. Bird species found in the Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests include the endangered white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni) and Blyth's tragopan (Tragopan blythii). Reptiles such as the krait (Bungarus caeruleus) and the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) are also found in the ecoregion. Threats to the biodiversity of the Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests include habitat destruction and fragmentation due to logging, road construction, and conversion for agricultural and development activities. Illegal wildlife trade, over-exploitation of forest resources, and development of tourist resorts also pose threats for the ecoregion’s ecology. To conserve this ecologically important ecoregion, the state governments of Mizoram and Manipur have established the Murlen National Park, Blue Mountain National Park and Paimafra Wild Animals Sanctuary in India while the Hkakabo Razi National Park and the government of Myanmar are protecting the Kachin area with a proposed 1,352 km² conservation zone. In 1993, the forests of Mizoram, Manipur, and Kachin were collectively added to the list of World Heritage Sites. Conservation efforts in these protected areas are being undertaken by the local communities, governments, and non-governmental organisations, in order to protect this fragile ecoregion and its ecosystems. The Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests contain a rich array of species and represent a unique combination of biodiversity and natural beauty. Thus, it remains one of the most important areas in Southeast Asia for conservation and research.",
    " The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election was the first election held in the newly independent Lithuania as part of the First Seimas. It was held on February 23, 1922 and was contested by 153 candidates from 21 electoral lists. The election was considered to be largely fair and democratic and was seen as a symbolic start to Lithuania's new-found independence. The election was called following the new Lithuanian National Council's decree of December 21st, 1921, which called for the nation to create a Seimas (Parliament) with a 151-member legislative body. Candidates could run singly or on lists and had to have a minimum of 500 supporters to qualify. All citizens of Lithuania had voting rights, irrespective of their class, religion, or gender. This election saw a large increase in the participation of women, with the number of female candidates increasing from just one in 1920 to 47 in the 1922 election. The women's list, called Žaliūkės (Little Greens), was created in response to fears of a return to pre-war conditions and won five seats. This made it the third-largest list in the election and the first women's party to gain representation in Lithuania's Seimas. The election itself was contested primarily between two main lists: the conservative Peasant Union and the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. The Peasant Union won the most seats (49), while the Social Democrats took 38 seats. The Lithuanian Christian Democrats, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, won 25 seats, while the Polish Christian Democrats and Žaliūkės won 5 seats each. The newly elected Seimas convened for the first time on May 17, 1922, however, the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union soon dissolved due to disagreements about the country's rural- urban balance of power. Later in the same year, the Peasant Union dissolved as well due to disagreements about agrarian reform. The Social Democrats and Žaliūkės fared better, with the former becoming the largest parliamentary group and the latter being a significant player in politics until the 1930s. The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election was a major victory for democracy in Lithuania. It was the first time that the newly independent state had held a free and fair election, and it opened the door for future elections, which became more democratic as time went on. It was a major milestone in Lithuania's newfound independence, and has helped Lithuania become the democratic nation it is today.",

    " Adult/Child is a concept in psychosocial development to describe the relationship between adult and child and how this interaction affects the development and wellbeing of the child. It focuses on how adults interact and respond to the social, emotional, and physical needs of the child. The nature of the relationship between adults and children is strongly shaped by the beliefs and values of the adults, as well as their attitudes towards the child. It is typically seen as a power dynamic in which the adult is in charge and has the ultimate responsibility for caring for the child. Therefore, an effective adult/child relationship is one that is respectful, supportive and nurturing, and enables the child to develop to their fullest potential. Some of the factors that influence an adult/child relationship include the emotional health of the adults, their level of psychological maturity, their experience with children and the amount of time they have to commit to caring for the child. Additionally, individual beliefs and values, attitudes to discipline and behaviour, and the availability of resources such as time, money and emotional support also shapes the relationship. The nature of the adult/child relationship is also shaped by cultural values and norms, which can vary considerably across different societies and international borders. While, in some cultures, adults may place a high value on instilling discipline and controlling the behaviour of children, in other cultures adults may take a more relaxed, open-minded approach and focus on developing and nurturing social and emotional relationships. The quality of the adult/child relationship has a significant impact on the outcome of the child's growth and development. A child who is exposed to positive adult/child relationships will often be more secure, happy and confident, and will be better equipped to cope with life’s challenges. Similarly, a child exposed to negative adult/child interactions, such as abuse, neglect or emotional neglect, is likely to experience long-term and often severe emotional and social issues. Therefore, fostering a positive relationship between adults and children is of vital importance for the wellbeing of the child. This should include providing a safe and secure environment in which the child can explore, learn and grow, developing a warm and nurturing relationship with the child, and offering consistent discipline and guidance. These are all essential elements for the long-term wellbeing of the child, and crucial for the successful development of their social and emotional skills.",

    " Jake Bilardi (June 25, 1996 - March 18, 2015) was an Australian teenager who was born in Melbourne, Australia. Bilardi, an Australian-born Muslim, was a member of Ansar al-Sunna, an Islamic State-affiliated group in Iraq. Bilardi was raised in Melbourne by his mother and stepfather, both of whom were later identified as having been displaced from Iraq as children. He made the decision to travel to Iraq after becoming radicalised online, and in November of 2014, Bilardi travelled undercover to Iraq. Having been born and raised in Australia, Bilardi had never visited Iraq before. In Iraq, Bilardi underwent religious and military training, eventually joining the Ansar al-Sunna group. As part of this group, he participated in several attacks against Iraqi security forces, including a suicide bombing in Ramadi in 2015. Bilardi was one of the youngest foreign fighters to be actively involved in the conflict in Iraq. In March 2015, Bilardi was reported missing and in June of that year, his family confirmed that he had died in Iraq. In the following month, a video was released by the Islamic State showing Bilardi preparing to commit a suicide bombing in Ramadi. The video generated widespread debate in Australia, with many commentators questioning whether the Australian security forces had done enough to prevent Bilardi from travelling to Iraq in the first place. Bilardi's story has been the subject of numerous documentaries, articles and books. In particular, his story has been used to illustrate the difficulties faced by young Muslims in balancing their faith and their lives in a contemporary Western society and how radicalisation can occur as a consequence of the pressures associated with this. His story has also been used to encourage dialogue between governments, security services, and community leaders in order to prevent future cases of radicalisation occurring. Furthermore, academics have used his story to discuss issues of youth identity, the roles played by online radicals, and the limits of state security capabilities. In Australia, his story has been used as an example of the need to strengthen communication between security services and Muslim communities in order to identify and address potential sources of radicalisation. In 2015, the state government of Victoria established the Jake Bilardi Prevention and Support Services, which provides assistance to young people who are vulnerable to, or have already been affected by, extremist ideologies.",

    " The Turkish Cypriots (Turkish: Kıbrıs Türkleri) are an ethnic group originating from the island nation of Cyprus, who are predominantly Muslim and of Turkish ethnicity. Although the majority of the population of Cyprus is Greek-speaking, the Turkish Cypriots constitute a significant minority on the island, forming roughly 18% of its population. The Turkish Cypriots are native to Cyprus and have strong cultural ties to Turkey, with around half the population having emigrated from the mainland in the wake of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Most Turkish Cypriots live in the part of the island which is under the control of the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while a significant number also reside in mainland Turkey and other countries such as the United Kingdom (where the largest diaspora population resides). The Turkish Cypriots have had a turbulent history of displacement and conflict, having been caught in the middle of tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots dating back to Ottoman Empire rule of the island. During the 1960s, tensions between the two ethnic Cypriot communities on the island climaxed in inter-communal violence, eventually leading to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. This saw the displacement of many Turkish Cypriots from the island, with a significant proportion of them relocating to mainland Turkey and other countries. The Turkish Cypriots have maintained a distinct cultural identity since their displacement and continue to speak their native languages of Turkish, Cypriot Turkish and Cypriot Greek. They are predominantly Muslim, with Sunni Islam being the most widely practised religion within the community. This is in contrast to the Greek Cypriot majority which largely follows Eastern Orthodoxy. The economy of Northern Cyprus, where the majority of the Turkish Cypriot community resides, is largely dependent on aid from Turkey due to its disputed status. This has led to a large influx of foreign capital and investment, leading to an improvement in the financial position of many Turkish Cypriots. Turkish Cypriots have also started to move back to the southern side of the island as a result of the understanding between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, with the first bus crossing the Green Line in April 2003. The Turkish Cypriots remain subject to political and social tension due to their disputed status on the island and their minority status in the Republic of Cyprus. They continue to work closely with the Turkish government and together they actively seek to improve the situation of the Turkish Cypriot people, both at home and abroad.",

    " Claude Thornhill (August 10, 1908 – July 1, 1965) was an American pianist, arranger, composer, and bandleader. Thornhill was born in Terre Haute, Indiana. His father was a professional violinist who had led his own dance band since 1931, allowing the young Claude to absorb music from a very early age. Thornhill attended Indiana State University for two years, where he received classical training in composition and a degree in music theory. In his early career, Thornhill performed jazz music at several small clubs in the Midwest before receiving a job touring as a pianist for a vaudeville show. He later served as an arranger and accompanist for a number of famous bands, such as the Casa Loma Orchestra and the Ted Weems Orchestra. It was while working with Weems that Thornhill wrote his first hit song, “Harlem Nocturne”, which later became a jazz standard. In 1940, Thornhill formed his own orchestra and quickly earned a reputation as a progressive bandleader. He was among the first to arrange jazz music for a larger orchestra — including French horns and a full string section to complement the standard brass, woodwind, and rhythm sections — and he was always willing to experiment with fresh new sounds. Thornhill signed with Columbia Records in 1941 and released a number of critically acclaimed albums throughout the 1940s. His first big hit was the song “Snowfall”, which charted at #1 on Billboard’s chart of the nation’s most popular songs for two weeks in 1943. Thornhill's unique sound caught the attention of many jazz fans, and he became one of the first big swing bandleaders to draw a sizable crowd of African-American listeners. His colleague, trumpeter Miles Davis, noted that Thornhill was “the first genuine jazz composer and musician who had the nerve to write for a black audience\". In the 1950s and 1960s, Thornhill toured and recorded extensively until health problems forced him to retire in 1965, the year of his death. His influence continued to be felt long after, inspiring later generations of jazz musicians and composers. He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1989.",

    " Netball in Africa is a popular female sport that is growing in popularity across the continent. The African continent has a long tradition of competing in netball, with the earliest known matches being played in South Africa in the early 1900s. It has since grown steadily in popularity, particularly in countries such as Malawi, Mozambique and Botswana. In addition to the established leagues found across the continent, girls and women from Africa have also come together to take part in prestigious youth and international tournaments such as the 2015 Netball World Youth Cup Africa tournament held in Uganda, and the 2016 African Netball Championship which was held in Zimbabwe. Netball is not only an exciting and fast-paced team sport, but it also provides potential lessons and values to participants. As such, it has helped to encourage empowerment and inclusivity among many of the young women who take part in it. This has been particularly true in countries with lower education quality, as the game provides an opportunity for girls to participate in activities and build new skills, while having fun at the same time. Netball in Africa has the potential to become even more popular in the coming years; encouraged by the increasing number of African International Netball Federation and International Netball Federation sanctioned events, and with more countries, such as Uganda and Zambia strengthening their developing netball programs. With this, the continent will hopefully be able to further strengthen and expand the popularity of the game and enable more young women to participate in it. Despite the positive development of netball across Africa, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in order to ensure the continued growth of the sport. First and foremost, is the lack of funding, resources and infrastructure which has meant that many of the local and international tournaments have been cancelled due to insufficient numbers of players or an inadequate playing area. Furthermore, there have also been reports of high levels of gender discrimination and inequality in certain African countries, directed specifically towards netball events, which can further compound the difficulties of organizing and running events as well as maintaining regular training and competition fixtures. Indeed, despite the growing popularity of netball in Africa, much more still needs to be done to ensure that the game is able to fully realize its potential. Increased levels of support and investment in the game are necessary in order to help to continue the development of the sport, and ensure that the African continent can become a formidable competitive force in international netball.",

    " Schizopygopsis is a genus of cyprinid fish that are native to Central and East Asia, from Bhutan and Nepal to the Amur Basin in eastern Russia and northern China. The genus contains over twenty species, most of which inhabit upland rivers and streams with cool to cold water environments. Some species may also enter waters around lakes and the edges of wetlands. The majority of Schizopygopsis species are medium-sized, with adults growing up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. They can be identified by their streamlined and laterally compressed bodies, featuring large eyes, powerful jaws and teeth, as well as muscular dorsal and caudal fins. Whilst adults of the species display a gray-brown coloration dorsally, most species also exhibit a distinct color pattern on the sides and belly, often with patterns of blue, green and red. The diet of Schizopygopsis consists mainly of aquatic insects such as midge larvae, crustaceans, and the larvae and eggs of other fish. In turn, the adults and juveniles of Schizopygopsis are consumed by a variety of predators, such as herons and hawks, as well as other fish. Schizopygopsis species may also occasionally enter into spawning migrations. For example, the Schizothorax richardsonii may migrate up to 40 km (25 miles) from their year-round habitats in isolated rivers to reach the tributaries of large lakes. When spawning, adults of this species may form dense aggregations. Upon hatching, larvae of most species drift downstream until they reach nursery habitats of shallower, warmer waters. Like many species of cyprinids, Schizopygopsis species are an important food source for local populations and are widely fished. Thus, there is intense pressure on these species, particularly in areas where capture limits are not regulated. As Schwizopygopsis inhabit relatively narrow ranges, they are susceptible to habitat changes that can affect their limited populations and also increase the risks of overfishing. Therefore, it is widely recommended that management plans be established to conserve these populations. Management plans should include provisions for setting appropriate catch limits and protecting their habitats from both chemical and physical disturbance. Furthermore, research should be conducted to better understand the ecology of these species and the effects of various environmental changes.",
    " Future Worlds is a term referring to an imagined world in the future. This concept has been explored extensively in literature, films, television, video games, and other forms of media. The vision of future worlds typically centers on technological and socio-economic advances that have drastically changed the way people live, work, and play. Whether depicting a utopian paradise of advancement or a dystopian wasteland of destruction, all versions of the future promise a glimpse into the potential that lies in store for humanity. If not for the constant refinement and evolution of technology, many of the imagined futures presented in books, movies, and video games would not be possible. Examples of future worlds presented in media are plentiful. In literature, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or George Orwell's 1984 explore the potential of societies vastly different from our own. In film, Joss Whedon's Serenity, Christopher Nolan's Inception, and James Cameron’s Avatar offer fascinating visions of the future. Television series such as Star Trek, Babylon 5, and Battlestar Galactica are also noteworthy in this regard. Video games are perhaps the medium most closely associated with the concept of future worlds. Examples such as Bioshock, Half-Life 2, and Mass Effect all feature visually stunning environments where the player experiences life outside of our reality. In each of these, the player is tasked with wandering through unknown and highly advanced environments full of unique challenges. Future worlds in media are often used to explore the potential consequences of humanity’s behavior over time. By leaving familiar surroundings and entering a world not yet realized, readers, viewers, and players can see firsthand the potential options available to society and its future inhabitants. In this way, future worlds can be seen as a kind of warning against the dangers of unchecked progress and ambition. Although always highly speculative, future worlds have become an integral part of the human experience in the modern age. By immersing oneself in an unknown reality that promises to be greater than anything which has come before, we can gain a glimpse of how our current actions and decisions may shape the future of our species.",
    ". NDUFAF5 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein found in humans and other animals. It is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase family of proteins and is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and function as part of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene and is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial energy production. The NDUFAF5 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, consists of four exons, and encodes an outer-membrane protein of the same name. This gene has been linked to a mutation in the human NDUFAF5 gene associated with Leigh Syndrome. Leigh Syndrome is a severe neurological disorder which is caused by a defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. NDUFAF5 is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase family and, like all members of this family, it is a component of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the ubiquinone pool, and therefore plays an important role in energy production within the mitochondria. Functionally, NDUFAF5 has been shown to have an essential role in the assembly of the respiratory complex I. Specifically, it acts as a scaffold protein which binds the iron-sulfur clusters of the complex to the membrane at the interface. As such, NDUFAF5 is thought to be important for the efficient assembly of complex I and for its proper functioning. In addition to the role that NDUFAF5 plays in the assembly of complex I, it has been suggested to play a regulatory role in this evolutionary ancient enzymatic pathway. Specifically, it has been proposed that the interaction of NDUFAF5 with complex I is partially regulated by post-translational modification of NDUFAF5, suggesting that it may play a role in controlling the levels of complex I assembly and its activity. Overall, NDUFAF5 is an important mitochondrial membrane protein involved in electron transport, energy production and complex I assembly. Furthermore, the mutation of this gene has been suggested to result in Leigh Syndrome, highlighting the importance of NDUFAF5 in the healthy functioning of cells and organisms.",
    " Brandubh of Tynagh is an early 8th century Irish game discovered in 1953 by Helen Roe and recorded by archaeologists in Ptolemy Dean's National Museum of Ireland excavations in county Galway. It is the oldest known board game in Europe. It is believed to have been played by the Celts. Brandubh consists of a board in the shape of a shield composed of 6 dots looking like points on the circular shield. There are also 5 pieces consisting of two black pieces that represent warriors and three white pieces that serve as the king and his counselors. The game has all the elements of a chess-like strategy game. The object of the game is to capture the king while protecting one's own king. To play the game, the pieces are placed on the board according to the positions of the dots which represent the cities of the players. The pieces are then moved according to a unique set of simple instructions requiring movements on the playing board. The pieces are moved until one side is victorious. The warrior piece, called the \"brandubh,\" has the ability to move in any direction, jump over opponents or occupied squares, and capture any piece it lands on. Brandubh is still played in some parts of Ireland as a local custom. The game has been studied and interpreted as symbolic of conflict in the region in the 8th century, with the king and warriors representing powerful noble families fighting for land and resources. The discovery of Brandubh reveals the emergence of more sophisticated board games in Celtic society at the time. The board of Brandubh was found during excavation at the Irish site of Tynagh. The pieces were carefully labeled and are believed to have been made of bone. The discovery of Brandubh gave birth to a whole host of new interpretations of Irish Celtic board games. In fact, the game is so important to Irish culture that the Irish government once issued a commemorative coin bearing its depiction. The game of Brandubh of Tynagh is invaluable to Irish board game history and is a living testament to the culture of the Celts that lived there. It has grown in popularity over the years and is now celebrated by both Irish and international audiences.",
    " Doherty Amplifier is an RF power amplifier that is designed to improve the efficiency of RF power amplifiers. The Doherty Amplifier is a variation on the traditional Class-AB power amplifier design. It is named after Stuart Doherty, who developed the technique in 1936. The Doherty amplifier is characterized by two amplifier stages. The first is a high-efficiency Class-A amplifier, known as the carrier or drive amplifier. This amplifier is used to provide the bulk of the power output at low power levels. The second is a low-efficiency Class-B amplifier, known as the peak amplifier, which is used to provide additional power at saturation or peak power levels. The Doherty amplifier works by operating the carrier amplifier at a lower power level than the peak amplifier. This allows the peak amplifier to be more efficient since it is only used to gain the additional power needed at peak power levels. By using this technique, the overall amplifier efficiency can be increased significantly when compared to a single Class-AB amplifier. The Doherty Amplifier can be used in a variety of applications, including broadcast radio and television transmission systems, mobile communications systems, as well as other RF and microwave systems. The advantages of Doherty amplifiers over traditional Class-AB amplifiers include higher efficiency, better power control, and improved linearity. In broadcast applications, Doherty Amplifiers have been used for many years to improve the overall efficiency of RF transmitters. They are preferred over most other types of amplifiers due to their unique design and ability to efficiently provide power at both low and peak power levels. Doherty amplifiers are also used in commercial and industrial radio communication systems and domestic applications, such as Wi-Fi systems. The advantages to using them in these applications are increased efficiency, improved linearity and better thermal stability. The Doherty Amplifier is an important component in RF communications and is becoming increasingly important in other industries as the need for higher efficiency amplifiers increases. As technology continues to improve, it is likely that this technique will be used even more widely in the future.",

    " Packet switching is a data communication method which breaks information into packets that are then sent over a channel shared by multiple types of communication. This allows multiple messages to be sent at the same time over shared communication lines while limiting the amount of interference each message experiences. Packets, also known as datagrams, are typically identified by their source and/or destination addresses, along with format and control information. Packet switching can support multiple communication protocols, including Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode, token ring, and X.25. Packet switching was first developed in the 1960s, but was improved throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, the technology moved from mainframe computing to distributed systems and was widely used in digital networks. Packet switching is often combined with other technologies such as frame relay, X.25, and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). Today, packet switching is still commonly used, particularly in the internet. Packet switching is advantageous over traditional circuit switching in several ways. It makes much more efficient use of bandwidth and resources, as the data being sent is broken into smaller chunks and only the necessary portion of a link will be used to send the data. Packet switching also allows for dynamic traffic routing, as packets can be sent through different channels to their intended destinations. This mode of communication can also support error detection and correction by re-sending packets if errors are detected. There are also potential drawbacks to packet switching. As multiple communication paths can be used for transmission, the amount of time for a message to reach its destination can vary. Additionally, collisions can occur, when the same link is used to transmit two or more packets at the same time. Finally, as packets are routed independently of each other, there is potential for packets to get out of order. Overall, packet switching is an effective method of communication for digital networks, and is widely used in the internet. By breaking data into smaller portions, packet switching allows for efficient communication which can support multiple protocols and dynamic traffic routing. While there are potential drawbacks, packet switching is still an important component of modern digital networks.

    " The 1520s in music saw a flourishing of polyphony, part songs and motets during the Renaissance period. The decade was a time of experimentation, with composers experimenting with different polyphonic structures, textures and rhythms. During this period, polyphony became increasingly complex, culminating in the works of Thomas Tallis and William Byrd. The range of genres during this period was vast, ranging from sacred music to secular songs. Composers of the 1520s wrote a variety of different sacred pieces, including motets, Mass settings and hymns. These works focus on the spiritual aspects of music and often include intricate melodies and harmonies, as well as harmonies written in the contrapuntal style. The most famous composers of sacred music during this decade include Josquin Desprez, Thomas Tallis and William Byrd. In the field of secular music, the 1520s saw the rise of the Netherlandic-French School and the English Madrigal. This new genre of music was characterized by its lively melodies, contrasting between homophonic and polyphonic structure, and its ability to create vivid scenes and moods. Popular composers of madrigals during this period include Thomas Morley, John Wilbye, and Thomas Weelkes. In addition to these two genres, music during the 1520s was also influenced by popular forms such as the estampie, basse danse and passepied. These popular dance forms, often accompanied by instruments like the lute, commonly appear in music manuscripts from this decade. The influence of the Renaissance period was pervasive throughout Europe, and the 1520s saw a wide variety of regional styles emerge. Composers from Italy such as Palestrina, Gombert and Marenzio incorporated imitative counterpoint into their compositions. In Germany and Austria, the influence of the Reformation lead to the emergence of a distinct chorale style, characterized by its strict contrapuntal settings and German sacred texts. In the New World, the 1520s are particularly noteworthy for the rise of the Mexican chanson. This genre, which has its roots in Spanish folk songs, developed into a distinct style featuring vocal parts and texts written in Spanish and Nahuatl. Popular composers of Mexican chansons include Diego Enciso and Juan López de Flandes. Overall, the 1520s were a pivotal period in musical history. This decade saw the emergence of many different musical styles, forms and genres, and the emergence of composers who would reshape the musical landscape of Europe and the world.",

    " Jin-go-lo-ba is a traditional West African rhythm and song game. It is thought to have originated in Cameroon and been passed on to various West African countries. It is commonly played among the Mandinka, Ewe and Ga people of Ghana, and other tribes in Guinea and Nigeria. The name Jin-go-lo-ba is derived from the phrase “to exchange messages of love,” which is indicative of the game's purpose, to engage players in a musical exchange or “dialogue.” In a typical game, two people take turns singing, clapping, and imitating each other's movements. The exchange between the two participants is interactive, with the two competing to make their movements the most creative and challenging, leading one participant to attempt more intricate moves than the other. No instruments are used during Jin-go-lo-ba. The players keep time with their hands and feet, and the game often relies on improvisation and audience participation. Players can also choose to add words, facial expressions, and variations in their movements and rhythms. Jin-go-lo-ba is usually played at weddings, festivals, or other celebrations. It is a form of entertainment, a means of expression, and a collective experience. Sometimes, two or three people join together to form a jin-go-lo-ba trio. The game has been adapted over the years and is increasingly used in contemporary performance contexts. It is also used in West African dance classes and drumming circles, as the musical and rhythmic structure of the game is ideal for exploring musical ideas and establishing a groove. Jin-go-lo-ba is now gaining popularity all over the world, as artists incorporate it into their own live performances and recordings. Now, with the rising interest in West African music and culture, Jin-go-lo-ba is gaining appreciation from around the world. Jin-go-lo-ba is an important part of traditional West African culture, and is sure to remain relevant for years to come. The game is proof that even with the development of western musical genres and instruments, it is still possible to have musical conversations with just the use of body movement and voices.",
    " Armenian needlelace is a type of fine needlework, also known as kshot or kshord, developed in Armenia in the 19th century. It is characterized by geometrically arranged white or off-white cotton threads worked into an intricate, symmetrical pattern of multiple layers. The process of making Armenian needlelace is much like that of other forms of needlework—needles and thread, not embroidery floss—but the outcome is a very distinctive, strong three-dimensional design. The basic element of the needlelace are the stitches which are made in a regular pattern to make up the ground or foundation of the design, typically with one layer of stitching having multiple layers of stitching added to it. The stitches used in Armenian needlelace include poke, round, and buttonhole, as well as 'satyn' (double running) and 'ojakheer.' It takes a great deal of skill and dedication to the craft to create a finished piece. The intricate patterns used in the craft of needlelacing make it unique and highly sought after. Patterns are repeated multiple times and even the most experienced craftsperson could not replicate a pattern by memory. Consequently, an Armenian needlelacer would traditionally document their work in a pattern book with written or drawn diagrams of the pattern. Armenian needlelace is highly valued and has a long history, tracing back to ancient times when it was used to embellish clothing and furnishings. It was used to decorate clothes and buildings, from churches to palaces, and the craftsman had to be highly skilled to achieve the intricate patterns. Armenian needlelace is a valued skill, not only for its beauty, but for its symbolism. During certain folklore traditions, young women gathered to sew together items of needlelace and would make toasts with the resulting piece. The toasts would serve to bless the young women and wish them success. The needlelace pieces were then blessed at church and hung in homes, believed to bring protection and health to the family. In modern times, Armenian needlelace is still a respected craft and continues to be used by skilled practitioners to decorate clothing, furnishings, even as a stand-alone piece. Its uniqueness and craftsmanship are what make it so special, and a testament to the generations of craftspeople who used the medium to create something that stands the test of time.",

    " \"I'm Moving On\" is a song by Yoko Ono, released as the second single from her 1982 album, Season of Glass. The song was written and produced by Ono, along with US record producer Bill Wray. The song was released as a 7\" single in Europe, backed with a non-album track titled \"No No No\". (This version has yet to receive a commercial release on CD or digital streaming services.) In Japan, where the song was not released as a single, the b-side was \"It Happened\". \"I'm Moving On\" is an upbeat, synth-heavy exploration of growth and personal evolution. Featuring lyrics that espouse themes of standing tall and rising up to overcome, Ono flexes her vocal muscle with a powerful performance. This potent blend of a positive message and retro-influenced production gives the song a timeless quality. The song's video offers viewers a window into Ono's unique view of the world. Directed by Ono herself, the video focuses on her abstract images, including a building on fire, two spaced-out kids in a field, and a medley of colorful post-modern art. Despite its upbeat nature and optimistic message, \"I'm Moving On\" did not receive much attention upon its original release. However, the song has since become a cult classic and has been covered by several artists, including The Dø, whose version appears on their 2010 album A Mouthful. Ono herself has performed the song on several occasions, most recently at the 2017 Peace On Earth benefit concert in Los Angeles. The song has also been sampled by numerous artists, most notably in the 2003 track \"Never Catch Me\" by LA-based hip-hop group Freestyle Fellowship. In 2017, the song was included on I'm Moving On, a remix album by producer Mark Reeder, featuring re-imagined versions of Ono's songs. The album examines Ono's sonic journey over the decades and her evolution as an artist. \"I'm Moving On\" is a song that still resonates with listeners today, as Ono's message of personal transformation is as powerful today as it was in 1982.",
    " Thomas's yellow bat (Cypselurus thomensis) is a species of fish belonging to the flyingfish family, Exocoetidae. It is native to the western Pacific from Taiwan to the Ryukyu Islands and Malaysia. The species is not often encountered and is little-studied. Thomas's yellow bat is a small species of flyingfish, growth up to 11.5 centimeters (4.53 in) in length. It has a slender body. The body and fins are yellowish in color, while the upper surface is blackish. Five or six spines are found along its back. Its eyes are small and positioned close to the mouth. The species is primarily a schooling fish which is found in shallow coastal areas. Common habitats for this species include coral reefs, areas with seagrass, and estuaries where they can feed on zooplankton. Adults of this species are capable of short gliding flights over the surface of the water for a few seconds and may be found skimming over the surface at night. Currently, there are no major threats to Thomas's yellow bat. It is an abundant species, found in mixed schools near shore and is captured regularly as by-catch in fisheries. However, it may be vulnerable to overfishing and habitat destruction. Thomas's yellow bat is of limited commercial interest and is not commonly marketed fresh due to its small size. Reports of it in the aquarium trade are rare. Its conservation is not monitored and no protective measures for the species exist. Thomas's yellow bat is one of many flyingfish species found in Southeast Asian waters and a common component of the local marine biodiversity. While little research has been done on the species, research into the ecology of flyingfish in general is considered to be an important task for determining the conservation status of the species.",
    ". Bracket creep, also known as \"fiscal drag\", is a phenomenon of taxation in which individuals and businesses move into a higher tax bracket as their incomes grow even though the actual percentage taken of their income may remain the same or decrease. This effect is caused by governments not adjusting revenue brackets and tax rates in accordance with inflation or by introducing new tax brackets to keep pace with increasing wages. The federal government of Australia created a system of tax brackets that guarantee the taxation of rising wages and inflationary income gains in the early 1980s. Since then, the phenomenon of bracket creep has been an ongoing issue, with increasing amounts of revenue from taxation contributing more and more to the total budget of the Australian Government. Bracket creep affects those with middle and low incomes more than those with high incomes, as the incomes of higher earners tend to rise with inflation, placing them in the higher tax brackets. Therefore, the effective tax rate of lower earners ends up increasing over time, while the effective tax rate of higher earners often stays the same or even declines. Inflation is one of the main culprits in causing bracket creep as wages rise with inflation but tax brackets do not. This leads to people earning relatively low wages moving into higher tax brackets as their incomes rise — often unwittingly — while the actual share of their income taken in taxes is unchanged or even decreased. For example, if the income tax rate in a given country is 15% but wages increase by 10%, the percentage taken in taxes may actually decrease despite the individual having moved into a higher tax bracket. Tax brackets creep can also occur when governments introduce additional tax brackets to deal with larger increases in income. This means that individuals earning low and middle incomes may move into tax brackets from which more tax would be taken from their earnings. In most countries, governments try to offset bracket creep with some kind of cost of living allowance; this generally takes the form of a tax break for lower income earners. The drawback of this approach is that it does nothing to help individuals already in the highest tax brackets, who still experience bracket creep and resulting higher taxes. It is worth noting that bracket creep is neither illegal nor intentional; it is a natural consequence of inflation and wage increases which tend to rise faster than tax brackets. Nonetheless, it is a subject of much debate and criticism due to the disproportionate effect it has on people on lower incomes.",
    " The division of Korea began when the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to have their respective military occupation zones split the peninsula in 1945 after their victory in World War II. The division followed the line of the 38th parallel north of which the United States placed the Korean people under their immediate military control and south of the line was a Soviet occupation zone. The division of Korea initially meant the separation of only the people living in each respective occupation zone, but soon it became a political and ideological division. The division of Korea led to a civil war between the two Koreas. This division was also heavily influenced by external powers, in particular the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two Koreas were rivals from the very start and any attempt at reunification was seen as a threat to their respective political alliance systems. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, both the United States and the Soviet Union sought to establish their respective spheres of influence in Korea, with the United States supporting the South and the Soviet Union supporting the North. This led to constant tensions and occasional clashes along the 38th Parallel, which was eventually transformed into the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone that continues to this day. Today, the division of Korea is considered to be one of the longest-running unresolved international disputes in the world. The two Koreas maintain a cross-border impasse, with the North refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the South, and the South refusing to enter an alliance with the North. The division of Korea has, however, been partially overcome through a variety of initiatives, most notably in 2018 when North Korea and South Korea declared an end to their decades-long war, committing to an eventual reunification and peace. The two leaders also signed an agreement of demilitarization of the Korean peninsula and to a mutual agreement not to intervene in the other's domestic affairs. The division of Korea has since been a major obstacle to peace and economic development in the Korean Peninsula, and to the stability of Northeast Asia as a whole. While the long-term goal of many is the peaceful reunification of Korea, it is widely believed that this will only occur if South and North Korea develop a sense of shared sovereignty. The inter-Korean relationship has rapidly improved since 2018 and dialogue and trust between the two sides is gradually growing. Until a sustainable solution is achieved, the division of Korea will remain a highly contested issue in international affairs.",

The activity or product may be in competition with the patent holder's own product or with products from other companies who have similar patents. In such cases, the patent holder has the legal right to take action against the offending party and to seek damages, or an injunction to prevent further use of the patented invention or trademark, and any harm this action may have caused to the patent holder's business. Patently offensive practices can be of a commercial nature, such as copying a product without authorization, or of an ethical or moral nature, such as copying the design of another company without permission. In general, violators of patents should be aware that the situation may be punishable by civil and criminal liability. The U.S. Congress has amended the patent infringement laws to provide criminal penalties of up to $500,000 in fines and 10 years in prison, depending on the severity of the infringement. Any individual or organization that violates a patent can be subject to such penalties. In addition, patent infringement could also lead to an injunction being issued, preventing the offender from further patent infringement activities. An injunction may also be issued by court order to prevent the defendant from continuing business activity, or to seek an immediate cessation of the infringing activity and/or the removal of existing competition from the marketplace. Patently offensive activity can be avoided by obtaining a valid license, or entering into an agreement with the patent proprietor allowing the use of the patented invention or trademark. Patent owners also have the right to license their patents to third parties and often seek to do so in order to seek licensing fees in order to monetize the intellectual property they have developed. Another important form of patent protection is the need to obtain a valid claim of patent infringement in court. In order to have standing to bring a patent infringement action, the patent holder must demonstrate that they can prove both the existence of a valid patent and that the defendant has infringed upon it. A patent infringement action is an expensive and time-consuming process, and can be quite a costly venture, so it is important to ensure that all legal bases are covered prior to pursuing such a course of action.",
    " Francis Gally (1834-1915) was an English clergyman, popular science writer, and advocate for progressive education. He was born in London of English-French parentage and was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. Gally was ordained in the Church of England and held several curacies, including vicar of Highgate from 1861 to 1868. He was progressive in his beliefs, advocating the use of new methods of education, and he was often at odds with traditional establishment values. Gally was a Unitarian and supported the rights of individuals against the dictates of the Church and State. He was educated in the sciences, wrote textbooks on anatomy and astronomy, and wrote plays exploring the place of human suffering as part of divine providence. Gally was an advocate of evolution long before its widespread acceptance and he wrote a series of articles called The Mind of Man Under Evolution in 1866. He also wrote books on evolution and popularized the idea of evolution through natural selection. Gally released the best-selling text book, the Compendium of Anatomy, in 1894 and drew on his love of the natural world to illustrate its many excellences. He also wrote a book on astronomy, A Course of Elementary Astronomy, in 1892 in which he explored the topic of the universe in light of evolutionary theory. Although Gally's books on science had wide popularity, his works on progressive education were less so. His works on education ranged from advocating the use of objects as teaching materials in place of the traditional blackboard and book to debating the validity of corporal punishment within the school setting. He also advocated for an examination system that did not reward cramming, but instead developed the individual talents of each student. Gally was known for his great enthusiasm for his students and his support of new methods of teaching. He was a great encourager of those who wanted to push the boundaries of traditional education. Gally's work and ideas received the attention of many prominent social reformers, including William Makepeace Thackeray and Alfred Lord Tennyson. Despite this attention, Gally's death in 1915 received little attention and no obituary was published. Although he may have had a remarkable life, Francis Gally is by and large forgotten today. In 2021, however, his works have been re-examined and he remains an interesting and influential figure in the history of modern education.",

In 1808, he was made a general-major and became a Divisional commander of a brigade at Heilsberg and Guttstadt. In 1809, he took part in the battles at Lutzen and Bautzen. It was shortly before the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 that Kleist was awarded the Pour le Mérite, Prussia's highest honor, for his actions at Lützen. Kleist continued to display his bravery during the War of Liberation of 1813–14, distinguishing himself at Waterloo and commanding the entrenchments at Laon. Kleist was appointed chief of staff to Prince August of Prussia in 1830. He was made a Baron of the Royal House of Prussia four years later. Kleist died on 13 November 1831 and was buried at Templin. Kleist's memorial monument in the Town Hall of Neustrelitz depicts him holding a flag in his right hand, with the words: “Here lies the loyal Henning von Kleist, Field Marshal of Infantry, Baron of Prussia and beloved Knight of the Iron Cross, he who served Prussia valiantly and bravely against all invaders, 1831.” The Prussian Army honored General von Kleist by naming several barracks and regiments after him. The 8th Leib Infantry Regiment, founded in 1808, bears General von Kleist's name. As of 2010, the 8th Leib Infantry Regiment was still serving in Prussia.",
    " The 1991 Mississippi gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1991, to determine the Governor of Mississippi. Incumbent Democrat Ray Mabus was ineligible to seek re-election due to term limits. Republican Kirk Fordice won the election and took office in January 1992. He faced off against Democrat William F. Winter in a close election that had a turnout of 515,474 voters and was decided by less than 10,000 votes. Fordice was a first-time candidate for political office, but had been active in the Mississippi Republican Party for several years. He had the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, President George H. W. Bush, and Bush's son, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. Fordice campaigned on a platform of fiscal conservatism, job creation, and tax reform. Winter, a veteran politician and former Governor, was supported by President Bill Clinton, as well as Mississippi’s Democratic politicians. He intended to expand educational and economic opportunities, while continuing the social progress initiated by Mabus during his time in office. Fordice won the election despite weak fundraising due to President Bush's unpopularity in the state. He was able to draw in support from conservative voters and those residing in rural, predominantly white, areas of the state. Fordice was sworn into office on January 13, 1992, becoming the first Republican Governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction. He was re-elected in 1995, beating Secretary of State Whit Hughes and leading to Mississippi being dubbed the \"most Republican state in the union\" in both the 1996 and 2000 presidential elections. Fordice served two terms until January 11, 2000. During his time in office, Mississippi's economic growth increased, with gains in jobs, education, and infrastructure. He was succeeded by Democrat Ronnie Musgrove.",

    " The soda locomotive was an early type of steam locomotive designed to use the power of pressurized soda water instead of a traditional boiler. The locomotive was developed in 1815 by Robert Stirling, a Scottish gentleman who was inspired by French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot's research on the power of steam pressure. The locomotive was powered by pressurized carbonated water instead of steam generated from a boiler, which allowed for greater speed. Stirling believed that this would be safer than a large boiler as it enabled the fireman to stop the train quickly if necessary. The locomotive worked by feeding hot water from a firebox into a large tank called a charging chamber. Sodium bicarbonate crystals were also added to this charging chamber, forming a Caustic Soda solution when dissolved. By compressing the solution, the water and sodium bicarbonate reacted and the resulting gas was pressurised, forming a high energy equivalent to a boiler. This gas was then sent into a cylinder where it was pressurized and expelled, pushing the locomotive forward. Each soda locomotive was built with a number of safety features such as warning alarms and a safety valve in the charging chamber, which was designed to open in the event of too much pressure build-up. Despite its promise, the soda locomotive failed to catch on. One of the biggest issues was that the use of caustic soda meant that the locomotive had to be frequently removed from service for maintenance and to reduce the risk of corrosion which seriously hampered operating costs. By the mid 19th century, the design was quickly replaced by more reliable boiler-driven locomotives. Despite its short life, the soda locomotive is an important advances in rail engineering, influencing the next generation of steam locomotives. Some of these features, such as pressure regulation valves, can still be seen in modern locomotives today.",

She was one of the most prominent women revolutionaries in the Indian independence movement, and was a member the Indian Republican Army and the Azad Hind Fauj. Hridayakumari was born on 31 May 1903 in East Bengal. She was born into a family of high status, but she was determined to contribute to the independence movement. From a young age, she had shown a reluctance to society binding her to traditions, and actively protesting against such traditions to carve out a liberated space for herself. Hridayakumari joined the armed struggle against the British rule along with other women revolutionaries.

    " The Real Quiet Storm was a musical phenomenon in the mid to late-1970s, primarily in the United States and later in the UK and other parts of the world. It was characterized by a slow, melodic style of R&B music that blended elements of soul, jazz, and sometimes even funk. The title of the music was derived from an album of the same name released in 1976 by Smokey Robinson. Robinson's album was influenced by what he called \"the sound of the storm\", which was a melding of his background in Motown soul music with the newer sounds of jazz. These elements created a calming, peaceful sound that Robinson felt was perfect for those mild, seductive summer nights. Shortly after the release of Robinson's album, other artists started to incorporate this sound into their own styles, creating the Quiet Storm-style of music. Perhaps the most successful Quiet Storm artist was Luther Vandross. Vandross established himself as one of the greatest interpreters of Quiet Storm music with his solo works, as well as his collaborations with other artists. His albums \"Busy Body\" (1983) and \"Give Me the Reason\" (1986) are acknowledged as masterpieces of the genre. Other prominent Quiet Storm artists include guitarist George Benson, singers such as Luther Ingram, Anita Baker and Freddie Jackson, and groups like the Isley Brothers. Quiet Storm songs generally share certain attributes. They have soulful, mellow, and often romantic lyrics, with subtle melodies and meaningful grooves. Most Quiet Storm songs are between five and seven minutes long, allowing for instrumental solos and extended vocal ad-libs. Today, Quiet Storm music continues to be played on adult contemporary and soft rock radio stations across the world. It remains popular as background music at intimate gatherings, such as dinner parties, as well as at romantic events. Established soul and R&B artists such as Mary J Blige and Jill Scott carry on the legacy of the Quiet Storm, while younger stars such as Maxwell and John Legend keep the music alive for a new generation.",
    " Lolium perenne, also known as Perennial rye grass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa. It has been introduced to many other parts of the world, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, and various other parts of the world for forage and turfgrass. It has become a weed or a nuisance in some areas, such as California, where it was a USDA noxious weed from 1996-2001. It was probably first introduced as crop seed in the 18th century. Lolium perenne is a short-lived perennial, growing in tufts up to 1m in height and 0.5 m in width. It has a creeping rootstock, with a fine texture and generally a slightly purplish color. Leaves are narrow and glabrous, with the upper surface somewhat shiny, and a membranous ligule below. The inflorescence is a spreading panicle of spikelets. It is a very competitive grass, with a fast growth rate and a high rate of spread. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types, and tend to become the dominant species in areas such as lawns, roadsides and other disturbed habitats. Lolium perenne has a wide range of uses. It is commonly used as a lawn turf and pasture grass, although in its natural state it is very competitive and can quickly dominate a lawn unless regularly mown. It has also been used in golf courses, playing fields and camp-grounds. In parts of Europe it is regularly used in meadows and pastures, and it is a regular component of many hay and fodder mixes. In the United States and Australia, Lolium perenne is often used as cover crop in orchards, vineyards and other agricultural fields. It does not require fertilizer or irrigation, and is adapted to a range of soil types. It is used in areas with high levels of salinity and acidity, and also can grow on soils with low levels of nitrogen or phosphorus. It is also a good choice for areas that face water shortages. By suppressing weeds and improving soil health, it can increase agricultural productivity. Lolium perenne has recently been recognized as an important source of biofuel, due to its fast growth rate, high energy content and ability to adapt to a range of environment types. Due to its prolific growth, it absorbs an amount of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis that is significantly greater than other grasses. However, it is not as efficient in capturing nitrogen and other minerals and therefore requires more nutrient inputs than other grass species. In conclusion, Lolium perenne is a widely-used grass, with a broad range of uses in both agricultural and landscaping contexts. It is fast-growing, tolerant of a wide range of soil types and conditions, and has recently been identified as a potential source of biofuel. Despite its potential uses, it can become a nuisance in some places and steps should be taken to limit its spread. ",

Ultimately however, Dan's ultimate goal comes true as Livia and him actually be together, as two changes of time have Livia becoming his wife and the mother of his daughter Zoe. Sadly, the series was never allowed to explain completely through the remaining 13 episodes, as Fox chose to cancel the show after just one season. Nevertheless, Dan Vasser will always remain an iconic persona in the science fiction genre, not just because of his travels through time, but because of his brave attempt to alter various points of time and his inspiring wish to be reunited with the love of his life.",
    " The Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is an episcopal title in the Church of Ireland which takes its name from the diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry that covers Connacht province in the west of Ireland. The diocese was formed by merging the former bishoprics of Tuam, Killala and Achonry in 1742. Following a short period when the Church of Ireland was in schism, the two were united again in 1841, leaving the incumbent as the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is the Ordinary of the diocese, which has its episcopal seat at St. Mary's Cathedral in Tuam. It is part of the United Dioceses of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry was also the rural dean of the archdeaconry of Tirawley until 1969, when the archdeaconry was merged into the archdeaconry of Mayo. The current bishop is the Most Reverend Patrick Rooke, who was consecrated on 31 January 2021 in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He had been the Bishop of Achonry for almost 30 years before being appointed to the combined see in 2020. The diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry has been in existence since the first Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1172. The earliest records of a bishop are those of William de Burgo, who was appointed Bishop of Tuam in 1253. He was succeeded by a number of other bishops, many of whom had previously been bishops of other sees in Ireland. The diocese was one of the first to have its bishops appointed by the papacy, rather than by local lay people. The diocese was subject to a number of changes in title, until the current unified title of the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry was officially confirmed in 1742. Since then the bishops have had a number of responsibilities, including running the Church of Ireland schools in the diocese, officiating at church services, confirming parishioners and ordaining clergy. The current bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is Patrick Rooke. He is assisted by four archdeacons, who look after day-to-day administration in their respective archdeaconries. Each archdeaconry is divided into parishes, each of which has a number of churches. There are approximately 300 church buildings in the diocese, some of which are ancient, while others are more modern. The Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is an important part of the leadership and administration of the Church of Ireland in Connacht. He oversees the diocese, provides pastoral care and episcopal ministry, and represents the Church of Ireland in the wider world. The see is a vibrant and active part of the province of Connacht and the Church of Ireland.",

    " Euseby Cleaver was an English dramatist, actor, and publisher of the late seventeenth century. His works were popular among Restoration theatre audiences and were frequently performed in Drury Lane and the Theatre Royal. Cleaver was born in the late 1650s in either Northumberland or Northamptonshire in England. Very little is known about his early life and upbringing, suggesting that he was either born into a family of modest means or that he was orphaned at a young age. Regardless, he found his way to London by the 1670s, where he began to pursue a career in the theatre. At some point in the early 1670s, Cleaver was invited to join the United Company, a group of prominent playwrights, actors and theatre professionals who ran numerous theatre franchises during the late 1660s and early 1670s. Some of his most famous works were completed while he was a member of the company, including The Governor (1677) and The Sea Voyage (1678). In addition to writing, Cleaver was also a prolific performer. He appeared in productions by John Dryden and William Wycherley, among others. He also had some success on the stage as a monologist and was frequently seen in comedy roles. He was especially known for his roles as loquacious roguish characters. Cleaver was one of the most active publishers and booksellers in London during the latter half of the seventeenth century. He published a number of his own plays and manuscripts, as well as many works by other authors. He managed the printing and distribution of works from some of the most distinguished playwrights of the day, including John Dryden and George Farquhar. Cleaver's other business interests included acting as agent for foreign plays as well as serving as publisher of the Beggar's Opera from 1728-1737. He frequently procured manuscripts from abroad, most notably from France and Italy, and wrote letters introducing them to the English booksellers. Cleaver died in 1743 in London. Despite his success as a dramatist, publisher, and actor during the Restoration era, he is noted today as among the less remembered of English playwrights. Nevertheless, his work during the Restoration period contributed to the development of the English stage in lasting ways.",
    " The projective line, denoted P^1, is the smallest projective structure, the simplest example of a projective space, and the basic example of a geometric manifold. The projective line is a one-dimensional space, consisting of two distinct points, and comes equipped with a topology, whose basic open sets are the two points, and their complements. It is a special case of an algebraic variety, and is a construction within projective geometry. Projective geometries are those that involve complex numbers and Euclidean transformations. A projective line is a structure that allows us to make new Euclidean objects by taking lines and points and transforming them in a certain way. The projective line, denoted P^1, is the basic example of this, and is a one-dimensional space with two distinct points. Projective geometry is important in its own right, and it provides a useful tool to study other geometries. In particular, projective geometry is useful in studying non-Euclidean geometries, where certain Euclidean properties no longer hold. For example, the properties of projective lines allow us to further consider n-dimensional spaces. In algebraic terms, the projective line is defined as the one-dimensional variety in P^2. A projective line can be described in terms of a set of homogeneous coordinates. It is impossible to provide an explicit description of P^1 in this way, but there are analytic descriptions available. In projective geometry, a projective line also serves as a base for the construction of projective spaces of higher dimensions. It is possible to define a projective plane, for example, as the space of lines through the origin in P^3. In topology, the projective line is an example of the topological structure known as a Mobius strip. This structure is formed by a continuous interaction between two distinct points, and is often used to study various topological properties. In mathematics, there are various uses of projective lines. In category theory, they can be used to study different categories and their relationship with each other. In algebraic number theory, projective lines are used to describe the field of algebraic numbers. They are also used in constructing various algebraic objects, including bundles of Euler projective lines. In physics, projective lines are used to describe various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of a particle of light in space. They can also be used to describe the behavior of matter subject to gravitational forces, in which the field lines are described by projective lines. Projective lines are an important part of mathematics, and their studies provide insight into the underlying structure of many concepts. They are also a useful tool for studying various physical phenomena. The projective line serves as a basis for projective geometry and for studying other geometric structures.",

    " Austroriparian is a term used to describe an ecological zone found in watersheds in the American South that historically supported a wide variety of flora and fauna. This term is derived from Latin, where auster meaning \"south\", and riparius meaning \"bordering on a waterway\". Austroriparian ecologies have similar habitat across the region with little differentiation between the Tennessee River Valley and the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The name of this ecosystem originates from the fact that it is located south of the Appalachian Mountains and has been shaped by the effects of streams and rivers from the mountain range. Austroriparian landscapes are primarily made up of riparian corridors that funnel waterway systems from north to south. This dense vegetative corridor stabilizes soils, moderates temperatures, reduces sediment damage, and provides food, nesting, and refuge for wildlife. The characteristic flora of this system includes a mix of native trees, shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Common species include oaks, cypress, sweetgum, pines, box elder, persimmon, elderberry, and palmetto. Shrubs such as elderberry, blackberry, dewberry, and greenbrier provide refuge and food for birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Forbs such as wildflowers, chinquapin, and crownbeard provide additional resources to wildlife. Austroriparian ecosystems are threatened due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, climate change, and urbanization. Overharvesting of resources has led to a decrease in populations of native species, such as mussels and fish, and an increase in invasive species. Runoff from agricultural lands, residential development, and golf courses contain pollutants that degrade water quality, particularly in more urbanized areas. Climate change is likely to cause drought and flooding in this region, leading to an increase in temperature that could shift the range of species found within an ecosystem. Austroriparian ecosystems are an integral part of the American South and help to maintain the region’s biodiversity. Conservation efforts are currently focused on protecting and restoring these areas through land acquisition, habitat preservation, and restoration projects. These initiatives are beneficial in providing habitats and resources necessary for fish, birds, and other wildlife. References: 1. Chappell, S. (2017). What is Austroriparian?.

    ". Monopoly (1985 video game), also known simply as Monopoly, is a popular American board game based on the original concept by Charles Darrow and George Parker. It was also released in 1985 as an officially-licensed video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is the first major electronic adaptation of the original board game and was developed by Rare Ltd and published by Nintendo. Gameplay involves a board divided into 30 properties to buy, sell, and trade. Each property is represented by an imaginary piece that also applies to building houses, hotels and charging rent on other players. The object is to accumulate wealth by building hotels and houses on each property, which increases the amount of rent that must be paid by other players when they land on those spaces. The first one to become ruined is the loser. The game includes seven computer opponents, each with their own distinct personalities and strategies. This adds to the challenge and strategy of the game, as players must ensure that their opponents don’t buy up all the properties before them. Along with standard gameplay, there are also a number of different game modes, such as “Speed Monopoly”, a faster paced three-to-five round game which is best for two-player sessions. There is also “Negotiation Monopoly”, where players start with a large sum of money and can trade and negotiate with one another. Additionally, the game allows players to customize the rules, speed of play, difficulty settings, and board layouts. This allows players to determine the best strategy for the game, as well as make the game their own. Monopoly (1985 video game) is widely recognized as one of the best titles available for the NES. For the 1985 Holiday Season, it was rated the ninth best selling NES game of that year. As of 2017, it is also still considered one of the best video game adaptations of the original board game ever made.",
    " The Wolseley Battery was a unique combination of artillery and infantry divisions of the British Army before World War I. It was created to support the British advance towards Germany in 1914. The battery was initially formed with nine 6-pounder (57 mm) quick firing guns, manned by the Royal Artillery. The guns were mounted on wheeled carriages and drawn by pack horses. They were designed to fire quickly and accurately, making them suitable for use in the close engagements expected in a modern war. The guns could fire shrapnel and high explosive shells, both of which had fire control routines so the British infantry could gain a tactical advantage. Alongside the Royal Artillery gunners, the Wolseley Battery was supported by a detachment of Riflemen from the King's Royal Rifle Corps, who carried out reconnaissance and other supporting roles such as providing covering fire in case the guns came under attack. In addition, the Battery was equipped with machine guns, mortars and signalling equipment. The machine guns were used as light weaponry, and the mortar was included to provide quick and accurate support during engagements. The signalling equipment was essential for communication between the Battery and the forward line. The Battery was originally commanded by Major G. A. Browne who became the highest ranking artillery officer in the Royal Artillery. He was later replaced by Major F. M. P. White, with Lieutenant G. C. Symes acting as second-in-command. The Battery quickly gained a reputation for their accuracy and swiftness, so much so that by October 1914 it was attached to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was under the command of the 1st Division of the BEF, where it participated in the first engagements of World War One in Belgium. During this time, the Battery gained recognition and respect from both sides of the war, as they were able to quickly and accurately engage enemy targets, often with devastating results. After the War, the Battery was decommissioned and disbanded, with the guns and personnel re-assigned to other artillery units. However, the name ‘Wolseley Battery’ continues to be associated with Britain’s artillery and infantry divisions, even to this day. The legacy of the Wolseley Battery continues to this day, with a museum dedicated to the Battery’s service in France located in Redhill, Surrey. The museum holds a variety of artefacts and memorabilia from the War, and is open to the public daily. The Battery’s role in shaping the British Army’s tactics, equipment and leadership as it entered the twentieth century has been accurately depicted in the museum. The Battery’s actions and successes during the First World War have been recognised by the Royal Artillery and by the British Army as a whole. The Battery’s name is continued on various honours and awards, including the awarding of the King’s Medal in 1918 and a memorial erected in the Royal Artillery Park in London in 1921. In 2006, the Battery was included in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list. The Wolseley Battery’s legacy is seen as a strong one, representing Britain’s ability to rapidly develop effective field artillery during the First World War. Its use of advanced tactics, weapons and personnel has been remembered as a turning point in the development of British military strategy. The Battery’s story stands as a testament to the capability and skill of the British forces.",

To assemble a plate of nasi lengko, place some of the cooked rice in the center of a plate and arrange the toppings and side dishes around it. Then, spoon some of the condiments and sambals over the rice and toppings. The variety of sambals and condiments can also vary from region to region. Some popular sauces and condiments to include with nasi lengko are sambal kacang, kecap manis, and bumbu balado. Nasi lengko is also a popular street food in many parts of Indonesia.

    " Steve Susskind (1945 - June 2000) was an American folk singer, songwriter and performer who is often credited as one of the driving forces of the 1960s folk music revival. He rose to prominence during the time when the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War and a decade of anti-establishment social movements. He was one of the first to tour throughout the country, introducing a new style of electric folk music to a generation desperate to rebel against traditionalism. Born in Brooklyn, New York City in 1945, Susskind grew up listening to traditional Hebrew music. By the time he was fourteen, he was playing banjo in a children’s theatre company and started to gain notoriety in the folk music scene. At the age of twenty-one, he opened an all-night cafe so he could perform his songs on a larger scale. In the mid-1960s, he released two influential albums that propelled him to national fame and acclaim. Susskind was a pioneer in introducing electric folk music to a mass audience. He taught artists like Ramblin’ Jack Elliot and Steve Goodman how to electrically accompany their acoustic guitar and vocal work. This allowed him and other musicians to bring their music to venues such as religious institutions and schools, places that many of the rock and roll genre could not access. In 1967, Susskind founded one of the most influential folk music labels, Fumble Records. In 1969, he and his wife moved to California and established a folk music publishing company and a production house. His talent as an artist was matched by his business savvy. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Steve recorded several critically acclaimed albums and played extensively throughout California, the Western US and Europe. He often traveled to Los Angeles to perform on folk radio shows and even performed at the White House during the Carter administration. In June 2000, Steve Susskind passed away while in the midst of recording a new album and writing his memoir, \"Notes from a Troubadour\". He is remembered for his contributions to the folk music scene, which heavily influenced the music of the 1960s by popularizing the electric folk style.",

    " School uniforms in South Korea refers to the standardized dress code that is enforced by the Korean Ministry of Education for the purpose of maintaining social order and discipline in the nation's public and private educational system. School uniforms are mandated from elementary school to high school, and although private schools have a certain level of autonomy to deviate from necessary requirements, they must still maintain regulations outlined by the Ministry of Education. Despite being a commonly accepted requirement, there are debates regarding the actual purpose and effectiveness of school uniforms in South Korea. Proponents of school uniforms assert that it acts as a form of collaboration between school and family; it reflects the mentalitity of the Korean government to follow rules and regulations; it eliminates competition among students by creating a homogeneous look; and it prevents students from distracting each other by dressing inappropriately. Opponents of school uniforms maintain that it inhibits students’ freedom of expression; it increases financial burden on parents; and it does not promote creativity or individual style. The debate aside, the style of school uniforms in South Korea has changed over time. Today, the typical Korean school uniform for elementary, middle, and high schools is made up of a top, bottom, a blazer, and a school shield badge. For male students a white shirt and black pants are required, and female students are required to wear a white blouse and black skirt. Additionally, there is a full range of optional accessories such as neckties, white gloves, and lanyards. It was only recently that neckties and lanyards for female students became mandatory. In addition to the clothing, students are also provided with school hats. For males, the standard hat design is the same throughout the country, while some variations exist between female students in different parts of the country. The design also often varies between elementary, middle, and high school. It is also common for backpacks and musical instruments to be color coded with the students' school colors or in the case of musical instruments with the student's school emblem. Today, school uniforms are seen as a contributing factor in creating a sense of unity and community in South Korea's public and private educational system. Despite the debate, these uniforms have mainly been accepted as a positive aspect of Korea's education system, helping to promote intelligence and hard work among students.",
    " Paul II Šubić of Bribir (c. 1255–ch. 1312), was a Croatian nobleman in Medieval Croatia, and a member of the illustrious House of Šubić, who ruled from Bribir. His reign was from c. 1263–1274, and witnessed the zenith of Šubić power in Croatia. Paul II was born in Bribir, the son of Croatian counts Paul I and Ana Karlović. Born in 1255, he succeeded his father Paul I in 1263, at the age of eight. His mother acted as his regent until he came of age, supported in the confirmation of her regency by the ban of Croatia, Ivan Babonić. Paul II is considered one of the strongest rulers in the House of Šubić due to the fact that during his rule, the family obtained immense power and wealth. After assuming control of the government in 1263, Paul II increased the family's influence further, by marrying off his brother Mladen to Bosnia's queen, Jelena Šubić. He also acquired the castle of Brelato, a strategic stronghold on the sea-route from the Adriatic to the Mediterranean. Unlike his father, Paul II successfully protected the southern borders of Croatia from expansion by the Bulgarian Tsars from the House of Asen and the Athonite monk Florentius. Between 1263 and 1271, Paul II conducted a successful and aggressive campaign against the Bulgarian Tsars. By 1272, the Šubić family acquired Dubrovnik, a port city which helped increase the family's wealth and power. Paul II's reign, however, faced its own struggles. In 1274, tensions arose between the Šubićs, and the Croatian and Bosnian provincial lords over the composition of the Bosnian government, which resulted in a war between the two sides. This eventually led to Paul II's death in 1302, ending the House of Šubić's control of Croatia, and brought on the era of King Vladislav II's rule. Paul II's legacy and accomplishments as ruler of Croatia still stand to this day. His exploits in war, advocating for Croatia's interests and protection of the country's borders, and matrimonial alliances which bolstered the family's influence and wealth are credited for the rise of the Šubić family. He is remembered as one of the strongest rulers in the House of Šubić.",

    " The II Riigikogu was the Second Estonian parliament, seated from 17 to 19 January 1919. It was composed of 112 members and represented a broad spectrum of political parties and platforms, mainly local peasant or worker associations. It declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1919, and continued to act as the parliament of Estonia until 20 April 1920, when it was replaced by the Third Riigikogu. The II Riigikogu was elected following the chaotic events of 1918, when the Russian Empire began to disintegrate, and Estonia declared its intention to set up its own parliament. The elections to the Second Riigikogu were held on 17 November 1918 and Elections to the Second Estonian Constituent Assembly were held to fill seats in the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu). The parliament was partly based on the previous Estonian Provincial Assembly, and half of its seats were filled with candidates of the former assembly. The first meeting of the II Riigikogu, chaired by Konstantin Päts, was held on 17 January 1919 in Toompea Castle, Tallinn. The parliament was overwhelmingly dominated by the Estonian Nationalists led by Jüri Uluots and Konstantin Päts. The Nationalists wanted to follow the Swedish-Finnish model of self-determination and secure as much autonomy from Russia as possible. The majority of the II Riigikogu was also in favour of signing a peace treaty with Soviet Russia and creating an independent Estonia. Despite being only 112 members strong, the Riigikogu was able to form several committees and create a number of laws. It managed to pass several important laws, such as the Law on Naturalization, the Fundamental Law of the Autonomous Republic of Estonia, and the Law on Education. The Riigikogu also declared a ten-year armistice with Russia on 4 March 1919, which, although never ratified, allowed Estonia to take a firmer stand in the peace negotiation process with Russia. It was during the term of the II Riigikogu, on 24 February 1919, when the Act of Independence of Estonia was declared. This proclaimed the country an autonomous and democratic republic. The members of the Second Riigikogu then formed a Provisional Government, which had to coordinate the work with Soviet Russia in order to execute the March 4 armistice agreement. The II Riigikogu held its final meeting on 20 April 1920, when the Estonian Constituent Assembly elected the Third Riigikogu. The II Riigikogu left a strong legacy and is remembered as the chamber that declared the sovereignty of independent Estonia and created a foundation for its statehood. ",

    " Ulfert Wilke (1893-1978) was a German entomologist and entomophile who was a pioneer of the study of fly genetics. He is best known for his work on the domestication of Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly that has become one of the most widely used laboratory models in genetics. Born in Berlin, Wilke studied zoology and botany at the University of Berlin. In 1927 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Greifswald and later professor of zoology at the University of Kiel (1932–1933). While at Kiel, Wilke undertook research on the genetics of fruit flies. He then accepted a position at Würzburg University, where he applied the principles of Mendelian genetics to fruit fly populations and was able to induce genetic variability by serving different food sources to fruit fly colonies. Wilke's major contribution to the field was the recognition that fruit flies are capable of being domesticated in the laboratory. This work, which was performed over several years, enabled researchers to control the genetic composition of laboratory populations. In 1940 he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Greifswald. Over the next decade he continued to study genetics, but also became interested in the biogeography of fishes, including a study of sturgeon. He later held posts at the universities of Hamburg and Kiel, and died in 1978. Wilke is remembered for his pioneering and influential work on fruit fly genetics, for which he was awarded a Darwin Medal in 1966. He also wrote a number of books and propagated the study of entomology among the general public. In particular, he was proud of his text ‘The World of Animals’, published in 1937, which traced the development of zoology in Germany and Europe. Although not as prominent in the scientific community as his contemporary Hermann Müller, Ulfert Wilke left an indelible mark on the fields of genetics and entomology. His research laid the foundations for today’s understanding of the genetics of fruit flies, and the domestication of insects in the laboratory. He remains a key figure in the history of evolutionary genetics, and his work continues to inspire new generations of entomologists.",
    " The Northeast Coast Campaign of 1745 (otherwise known as the New England Expedition of 1745) was an attempt by the French to capture colonial settlements in New England during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). The campaign was spearheaded by French Rear Admiral Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas-Roch de Ramezay, and included a fleet of five warships, three of which were French while the other two were supplied by Spain. The fleet was under the overall command of the Duc d'Anville. The campaign began in June 1745, when the fleet sailed from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and headed south towards Acadia, where the French forces would then be ready to proceed further south towards New England. The main objective of the campaign was to capture the major ports of Boston and New York City, which would gain France control of the lucrative North American fur trade. To this end, the fleet was well-equipped and carried a large contingent of troops, including French regulars and Native American allies from the Mi'kmaq and Abenaki nations. En route to New England, the French forces suffered a string of navigational mishaps. The worst of these occurred when a storm damaged the flagship and forced it to dock near the heavily forested island of Sable, located off the coast of present-day Nova Scotia. The delay caused by this setback provided the British with time to prepare a new expedition to protect their settlements in the region, led by Admiral Edward Boscawen. When the French fleet finally arrived off the coast of what is now Massachusetts in August 1745, they were met by a stronger British force and forced to retreat. The French navy caused some damage to several coastal settlements before withdrawing. While the French were unable to achieve any of their large-scale objectives, their presence did cause considerable panic in New England and helped to bring the region closer to the rest of the English colonies. Overall, the Northeast Coast Campaign of 1745 was a failure for the French. They suffered heavy losses in both men and ships before ultimately being forced to retreat. Despite this, the campaign was an important turning point in the War of the Austrian Succession, as French presence in continental North America continued to be a major concern for the British throughout the conflict.",

It is also referred to as the cubic lattice, cubic tiling, or dual octahedral lattice in crystallography. The cubic honeycomb is a space-filling lattice structure that is composed of cubes arranged in a three-dimensional grid. Each cube is connected to its neighbors in each of the six directions of the Cartesian coordinate system. This makes it a topologically unique honeycomb, as all of its cells (cubes) are adjacent to each other in three dimensions. The cubic honeycomb also has the distinction of being isotropic, meaning that all directions of the lattice look the same. The cubic honeycomb was first studied extensively by Leonhard Euler in the mid-18th century. In particular, Euler studied it for its connections to the Platonic solids. He used the cubical lattice to generate the octahedron, the cube, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. Euler also used it to develop a new system of notation for describing polyhedra, the Euler notation, which is now standard in many mathematics texts. The cubic honeycomb is most commonly used to construct systems of three-dimensional crystals, as it is one of the simplest lattices used in such systems. Its use in these types of applications stems from its ability to define a cubic space in which certain materials can stack without introducing strain on the structure. It is commonly used in the fabrication of metals, alloys, compounds, polymers and other materials. The cubic honeycomb also has a variety of applications in mathematics, particularly in topology. It is a fundamental structure of three-dimensional topology, as it is composed of cubes, the simplest unit of measure used in the field. It is used in the study of homology, which studies the topological features of different shapes, and in knot theory, which studies how two or more strands interact. Finally, the cubic honeycomb is used in physics, especially in models of higher dimensions. It is often used in the study of particle physics, such as in the four-dimensional spacetime of string theory, as well as in the study of cosmology. In short, the cubic honeycomb is an essential structure in the fields of mathematics, physics and engineering. Its use in describing patterns, constructing lattices and modeling systems makes it a crucial part of many branches of research.",

    " Real-time text (RTT) is a technology allowing people to type and send text messages as they would normally type and send an email or instant message. It is also known as “right now text” or “immediate text”, as messages appear almost immediately on the receiver’s screen. Real-time text can be used by individuals with a hearing impairment, as sign language interpreters are not necessary and the message can be sent and received instantly. Real-time text is used in various modes such as: * Telephone: It is used when two individuals use a telephone to communicate with each other. In this scenario, both individuals type their messages on the phone keypad and view the other person’s messages on their telephone screen. * Computer: Computer-based programming systems can also be used to communicate in real-time text. This can be beneficial for situations such as online job interviews where the prospective employer and the applicant are in two different locations. * Internet: The most common form of RTT is through the use of the internet. This allows people to type and send text messages to each other through an online chat platform such as Google Hangouts, AIM, or Skype. There are several advantages to using real-time text. By providing immediate feedback and communication, RTT helps to increase collaboration, aid in decision making and enable faster resolution of issues. Since RTT is a text-based, non-intrusive mode of communication, it can be used in environments such as doctor-patient consultations, business meetings, etc. Furthermore, the technology is relatively easy and relatively cost-effective to implement compared to other real-time communication tools. However, there are also some drawbacks of RTT. Since the use of RTT is limited to text-based communication, it does not replace other forms of communication such as audio and video calls which can be more effective for certain purposes. There also is a potential for misunderstandings and misinterpretations due to typing errors. Finally, RTT protocols are still in development, so there is not a standard way of using the technology, which can cause confusion among users. Overall, real-time text is a useful technology, especially when audio and/or video calls are unavailable, impractical or inappropriate. It is ideal for situations such as email conversations, group chats and long-distance communications. While RTT is not a perfect solution and does have some drawbacks, it does provide an efficient, text-based mode of communication for those who need it.",

    " Multiprotocol Encapsulation is a method of transporting multiple protocols over a single medium. It is commonly used for communication between nodes on different networks or for connecting multiple networks together. Multiprotocol encapsulation allows for the transmission of different protocols over the same network medium. In networking, a layer of data is added by an encapsulating protocol (IP, Ethernet, etc.) above the application data. This layer helps to provide a standardized format for transmitting data from one network stack to another. The encapsulating protocol is able to process received data and break it into its component parts for transmission to the appropriate protocols. Multiprotocol encapsulation requires knowledge of how to interpret each protocol as well as how to encapsulate them. This is typically done through packet encapsulation. In packet encapsulation, one protocol's header data is used to encapsulate part or all of the other protocol's header and data fields. This process is necessary to ensure that each protocol is transmitted according to its corresponding protocol specifications. In most cases, an encapsulating protocol will add some of its own data fields in between the encapsulated fields. These fields may contain information about the encapsulated data’s type, length, or source. The encapsulating protocol may also include a CRC sum number to verify data integrity. In addition to saving bandwidth, multiprotocol encapsulation can also improve the performance of a network. By allowing multiple protocols to run over a single network medium, multiprotocol encapsulation allows packets to take the most direct path through the network and be routed quickly and efficiently. This improves network performance because the network is no longer bottlenecked by the individual protocols. Multiprotocol encapsulation also helps to reduce the number of errors that occur on a network. By providing a common interface for all protocols, multiprotocol encapsulation helps reduce the amount of translation that must be done. This helps devices more easily interpret the received data and correct any errors. Multiprotocol encapsulation is important for interoperability in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By allowing devices from different manufacturers speaking different protocols to communicate, multiprotocol encapsulation helps ensure a wide range of devices can communicate with one another in a secure and efficient manner. In summary, multiprotocol encapsulation is a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and reliability of modern networks. By allowing multiple protocols to coexist on the same network medium, multiprotocol encapsulation can save bandwidth and improve network performance. Additionally, multiprotocol encapsulation helps to reduce the number of errors in a network and can be used to ensure interoperability between different devices.",
    " SS Minnesota was a steamship built in 1903 in Glasgow, Scotland, by the John Brown & Company shipbuilding company. It was built for the Atlantic Transport Line of Liverpool, and was originally intended to be used as a cargo and passenger ship. The Minnesota was initially registered in Liverpool, but was later registered in London. The SS Minnesota was a four-masted steel steamship, 403.5 feet long by 56.1 feet wide and had a gross tonnage of 9,084. It was propelled by a four steam-cylinder triple expansion engine and a single screw, and was also fitted with three masts for sailing purposes. Its maiden voyage was from London to New York City on April 14, 1904. The Minnesota was popularly known as the \"Queen of the Atlantic.\" It was named after both a state in the United States and a Dakota Sioux Tribe. It was the flagship of the Atlantic Transport Line, and the most luxurious ship of its time, featuring the first heated pool on an ocean liner, as well as four elevators, Turkish baths, gymnasium, and lovely saloons. Many of the original furnishings, decorative woodwork, hand-painted glass panels, and a bronze fountain with four cherubs still survived in the ship until shortly before its demolition in 1981. The SS Minnesota served as an immigration ship during World War I, carrying thousands of soldiers to the front in Europe. After the war, it returned to its original purpose as a cargo and passenger ship, making regular trips to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. In 1927, its passenger service was suspended, and it became solely a cargo vessel until its retirement in 1960. The SS Minnesota's final voyage was to Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1960. In 1981 the ship was sold to a Dutch scrapyard, and was subsequently dismantled and scrapped. Much of the furniture, decorations, and other items originally on the ship were salvaged and taken to the Netherlands Maritime Museum. The Minnesota was a remarkable ship whose luxurious and advanced features set the tone for modern ocean liners.",

    " Things and Other Things is a philosophy developed by Stephen Katz and others which seeks to provide a framework for understanding the relationship between particular subjective entities and the collective and infinite \"otherness\" of objects and events. It is mainly concerned with the concept of \"substantive identity\" in which a particular being is constituted of a single essence, often referred to as a \"thing\". This philosophy was developed in the late twentieth century, and originally presented to the public in the book \"Things and Other Things: A Study of Substantive Identity\" (1989). The book looks at the various questions of identity that arise when attempting to unify seemingly disparate parts of reality. Questions such as “in what sense an entity is the same as something else, or in what way is it distinct” are explored and discussed in great detail. The heart of the philosophy is the concept of substantive identity which asserts that each thing is composed of two distinct parts – the individual and the universal. Thus, each particular thing has its own identity based on its component parts, yet in some sense can still be seen as a part of something larger – the collective and infinite “otherness” of objects and events. This is often referred to as the “infinitely divisible identity” of things, or the “ontological puzzle of inter-particular relations”. In addition to the notion of substantive identity, Katz and his colleagues also discuss a related concept of “extrinsic difference”. This relates to the idea that each thing is not only intrinsically different from all other things, but it is also inextricably linked to all other things through its “other”. Thus, each individual object or event is intrinsically different, yet cannot exist independently, but must exist in relationship with all other things or events. Katz and his colleagues stress that rather than seeing things as existing independently, or existing in relation to the collective, we should consider them as existing in a dual relationship – both connected to and distinct from the universe of things and other things. Thus, in their view, the concept of “things and other things” helps us to understand the complexities of reality, and better understand the relationship between the particular and the universal. In conclusion, the philosophy of “Things and Other Things” provides a distinct framework for understanding the complexity of existence, and offers an alternative to more rigid philosophical conceptions of identity. By showing how each particular thing is linked to the greater whole, Katz and his colleagues demonstrate how we can better comprehend our relationship to the irrational and the infinite.",

This gave him considerable influence in military circles, and his military innovations and strategic plan were a great part of Prussian success during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was also a prolific writer, publishing on a variety of military and administrative topics for the Prussian Army. After the War of the Spanish Succession, Pernau blossomed as a military tactician and theorist. He published several works on military topics, such as “Passionate Enemy – A Dialogue on Military Affairs” in 1721. His writings and adaptations of the European military model were read and appreciated far outside of Prussia’s boundaries, and many European countries consulted his works while reforming their own military systems. In 1719 Pernau was appointed Field Marschall and made in 1730 a Count of the empire. Pernau was a devout Lutheran and deeply involved in Prussia’s reform of administration and other public services, including public education. Pernau was instrumental in the development of contemporary Prussia’s administrative and bureaucratic structure. At the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession, Pernau was recalled to the Prussian army and served under the command of King Frederick II during the campaign in Silesia from 1744-1745. He also played a key role in the negotiations of the Treaty of Dresden, signed in 1745. This treaty transferred Silesia to Prussia and was a crucial victory for the Prussian state. After the Treaty of Dresden, Pernau returned to Berlin and was made an Armaments Councilor in 1749. On October 9, 1750, he passed away due to a sudden stroke. This ended an influential career in Prussia's military, which helped shape the Prussian Army during the 18th century. Today, his work is still considered influential and renowned in military, administrative and political circles.",
    " New Jersey Route 183 is a 3.37-mile-long (5.42 km) state highway located in Salem and Cumberland counties in New Jersey, United States. The route runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Upper Pittsgrove Township to an intersection with New Jersey Route 77 in Pittsgrove Township. Route 183 was designated as part of the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The route was maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways until it was included as part of the state highway system in 1945. The route runs through mostly rural areas, serving mostly local traffic. Route 183 begins at an intersection with US 40 in Upper Pittsgrove Township. From here, the route heads northward, passing by a gas station. Route 183 then intersects Whitesville Road and turns to the northwest, entering Pittsgrove Township. In Pittsgrove, the route passes through forests before intersecting BR454 (Cedars Road). The route then continues for another 2 miles (3.2 km) before ending at an intersection with NJ 77 in Pittsgrove Township. Route 183 is an undivided two-lane road for its entire length and carries an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 7,800 vehicles. No route direction is signed along the entirety of Route 183. The entirety of Route 183 is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. As part of this system, Route 183 is subject to intensity restrictions imposed by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). The New Jersey Department of Transportation is planning to reconstruct the westernmost 2.2 miles (3.5 km) of Route 183 from the US 40 intersection to NJ 77 in 2020. As part of the project, the road will be widened from its current two-lane width to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The project is expected to be completed sometime during 2021. Overall, Route 183 is an important highway in Cumberland and Salem counties, serving local traffic and connecting Upper Pittsgrove and Pittsgrove Townships. The highway has been in existence since the 1927 state highway renumbering and will be widened and reconfigured in 2020-2021 to improve travel along the route.",

    " Fred Lillywhite (1813-1884) was an English cricketer, cricket writer and scorer. He was a contemporary of the great players of his time such as William Clarke, James Lillywhite and Tom Marsden. Born in Little Baddow, Essex in 1813, Fred was the fourth son of Henry Lillywhite, who was an established professional player. As a young man he followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a professional player in 1838 when he joined Surrey's County Cricket Club. Lillywhite was an allrounder, being a useful batsman and medium-pace bowler. However, it was his career as a cricket writer and scorer that made him famous. In 1848, Lillywhite published his \"Guide to the Game of Cricket,\" the first reference book of cricketing rules. This book was well-received, and Lillywhite was widely acknowledged as the first \"expert\" on cricket, often consulted by fellow cricketers. In 1851, Lillywhite, with help from other players, founded \"The Players Scoring Book,\" the first standardized scoring book for cricket matches. Each match was recorded in the book and calculated for points. This systematic approach makes Lillywhite not only a great cricketer, but also an innovator in the sport's history. Lillywhite wrote several other books on cricket over the years, including \"Illustrations of the Fast and Loose Theory of Cricket\" (1845); \"The Cricket Companion\" (1849); and \"To the Good Conduct of the Match\" (1860).

    " Internal wave, also known as internal Tide, is a gravity wave generated within a fluid medium and composed of regions of higher and lower density. Such waves are generally created by variations in temperature, salinity, and/or background flow. Because of their intrinsic nature, they act as a means of energy propagation and transformation within the ocean, atmosphere, and other bodies of water. History The earliest evidence of the internal wave's existence comes from the 19th century astronomer William Rutter Dawes and his experiments with sound in water. His work demonstrated that the sound would travel in a wave-like pattern and pass through layers of higher and lower density water. This eventually led scientists to believe that such waves could propagate through ocean waters. In 1851, the Austrian physicist Christian Ludwig von Lützen discovered internal waves through photographic observations in the Bay of Naples and Dublin. His photographs, which graphically illustrated the processes of refraction, reflection and interference, were the first observations of internal wave processes. Dynamics Internal waves are generated by changes in either the density of a fluid medium (density-driven) or by variations in the background flow (state-flow-driven). Density-driven internal waves can be created as a result of thermal or salinity stratification, where the medium consists of regions of different densities due to a decrease or increase in temperature or salinity. On the other hand, state-flow-driven internal waves are generated by the presence of an external force or by a variation in the pressure exerted on the system by an external agent. The nature of an internal wave depends on the wavelength, amplitude, and frequency of the wave. Wavelength determines the amount of energy associated with a given wave while the amplitude determines how far into a fluid medium the wave penetrates; frequencies between 0.001 and 10 Hz are typically associated with internal waves. The largest internal waves are often observed in the world's oceans and can extend a length of over 400 kilometers. Effects Internal waves can affect various natural phenomena at different scales. At the local scale, internal waves can influence the properties of a body of water, such as its temperature and salinity, thus affecting its chemical and biological composition. At the regional scale, these waves can trigger powerful currents known as the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) which circulate throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. At the global scale, internal waves are capable of affecting the ocean-atmosphere boundary. This boundary is the interface between air and water which directly influences global climate patterns and weather. Particularly, internal waves can alter atmospheric wind patterns, as well as heat transport and the distribution of precipitation in the atmosphere. Additionally, internal waves have the ability to redistribute energy from the lower to the upper layers of the ocean, thereby playing a role in the world's climate by affecting its thermohaline circulation. Conclusion Internal waves, whether density- or state-flow-driven, are a unique type of gravity wave which propagate within a density stratified medium. Such waves possess various effects at different scales, ranging from local sensory changes to larger-scale interactions such as wind patterns. Understanding the dynamics and properties of internal waves can provide valuable insight into the processes occurring in the atmosphere and ocean, ultimately providing a better understanding of the climate system.",

    " Siegfried Haag (born 1891 in Dornau, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) was an internationally renowned cuckoo clock designer and manufacturer. He is credited with inventing the modern cuckoo clock in 1951, which enabled mass-production of the clocks. Haag worked as a clock maker in the German city of Heidelberg before setting up his own company in 1921 in the city of Schramberg. He first focused on creating Baumgarten clocks, a form of wall clock with a spring descends and subsequently falls down again at regular intervals, striking a little hammer against the bell. In 1951, Siegfried devised a way to mass-produce cuckoo clocks and made them affordable to most households. Together with his sons, Haag also produced an intricately designed chalet-style clock, then the most popular form of cuckoo clock for Germany and other European countries. The design proved hugely successful and remains popular to this day. Haag was a brilliant engineer who cared a great deal about the quality and precision of his clocks. He was the first to adopt the modern technology of CNC (Computer numerical control) milling to produce cuckoo clock parts. He routinely tested clocks for fault-freeness, ensuring that customers received the best product. With his sons, Siegfried established seven international service centers for local customers as well as customers from around the world. The first service center was established in Heidelberg in 1966, and other service centers were set up in Switzerland, Japan, Canada, the United States and Australia. Siegfried Haag passed away on February 24, 2008 at the age of 117, leaving behind an impressive legacy of cuckoo clock designs, one that has contributed greatly to the cuckoo clock industry today. His clocks are now held in many public and private collections as well as being revered as highly sought after pieces amongst collectors.",

    " 23327 Luchernandez is a minor planet orbiting within the inner Solar System. It was discovered on December 2, 1997 by David Lee and Carlo J. Lacerna at the University of Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) Observatory in Laguna, Philippines. Its provisional designation was 1997 XV12. The object was eventually named after UPLB's Dr. Lucerna Hernandez, an active researcher in the field of astronomy. She has researched a variety of astronomical objects, from asteroids to comets, both from ground-based and space-based observatories. 23327 Luchernandez has an approximate diameter of 5.9 kilometers and is classified as a main belt asteroid. It has a relatively low albedo of 0.07, indicating that it is a darker-than-average asteroid made of a composition more similar to carbonaceous chondrites than to stony meteorites. Based on its orbital parameters, 23327 Luchernandez is classified as a near-Earth asteroid and the Sentry Risk Table assigns the highest Torino scale rating of 4 (meriting special attention) to its projected close approach to Earth in 2053. It has a relatively low inclination of 4.1º, semi-major axis of 2.556 AU, low eccentricity of 0.15, and a sidereal period of 1651.80 days. 23327 Luchernandez has been observed a total of 8 times over the span of its orbit. As it passed close to Earth three times over recent years, it was observed more closely than usual. In 2006 and 2009 its magnitude was as high as 13.7, allowing it to become the target of photometric observations. 23327 Luchernandez's observers hope that further understanding of its behavior will come with more accurate estimates of its mass. That, together with its relatively lower-than-average albedo, can provide valuable knowledge about asteroidal composition and its effects on climate change.",

    " Cthulhu Rising is a horror novel by British author Graham McNeill, released in 2010, set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe in a pocket universe, the battle for Armageddon that was featured in the first novel of the series, First and Only. The novel is the first in the 2010 Black Library series of the same name. The novel follows the adventures of the space marines fighting against the forces of Chaos in the Armageddon Pocket Universe. The forces of Chaos are led by Sorcerer Lord Ignato Menschen, a Daemon Prince of Nurgle. The Grey Knights, led by Grand Master Justicar Alaric, race to stop him, as his plan involves the summoning of the powerful entity Cthulhu and unleashing it upon the universe. The novel opens with Alaric already in the grips of the daemonic incursion. He is joined by the Silver Wolves, a squad of space marines who are sent to provide reinforcements. After a few skirmishes, they come face to face with Ignato and Cthulhu. The daemon prince reveals that the summoning of the ancient entity is part of a larger plan to bring Nurgle's power to the Imperium. Cthulhu then rises from its slumber on the battlefield, unleashing its might upon the battle. The force of the impact is so powerful that many of the space marines are killed. Alaric and his forces are able to slow the advance of Cthulhu, and eventually kill it with an anti-daemonic device. The Grey Knights are victorious but at a great cost, as many of their number have been killed in the fighting. Despite this victory, the Imperium's forces realise they cannot beat the forces of Chaos alone. Alaric is forced to go against the Grey Knights oaths of secrecy and alert the rest of the Imperium to the danger. He is able to use the Argos Protocol, a distress signal sent to the Imperium's leaders, to let them know of the daemonic incursion. The novel ends with Imperial forces from the wider galaxy arriving to aide the embattled space marines in Armageddon. The novel sets up many of the events in the subsequent novels of the series where the forces of Chaos, as well as Cthulhu, are featured heavily. Cthulhu Rising was well received, garnering a great deal of praise for its excellent pacing, storytelling, and depiction of Warhammer 40K. It was seen as a strong return to form for McNeill who had previously written several novels set in the gaming universe. It is not just a great story however, but also the perfect illustration of the core themes of the Warhammer 40K setting. The fear, violence and heroism entwined in this novel make it one of the most memorable and gripping novels in the series.",
    " Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine is an autobiography written by Saint Augustine of Hippo around AD 397 – AD 400. It consists of 13 books, and was an influential work of Christian theology and Western philosophy. The work outlines Augustine's sinful youth and his conversion to Christianity. It is widely seen as the first Western autobiography ever written. The Confessions is divided into three parts. The first part details Augustine's wicked childhood and how he fell into sin. He speaks of the gods his family worshiped, and his education in spoken and written word. He speaks of his difficult relationship with his mother Monica and his indulgence in various earthly passions such as sex, gluttony, laziness and pride. The second part of the work is when Augustine is filled with guilt. He goes on to write about his conversion and how through prayer he is able to find peace in Christian faith. This is what he calls his 'restless heart'. He talks about his search for truth and faith, and largely ignores his earlier life. Lastly, Augustine speaks of the grace of God and the Catholic church. He talks about how his faith has changed his life and how he has been able to find peace and redemption by communing with God. He also speaks of his unyielding faith in the divine will of God. In the last chapter of the book, Augustine expresses his hope for the future of the church. The Confessions has been seen as an influential work of Christian theology, and it is credited with playing an important role in the development of Western thought. It has had an immense impact on Christianity, since it outlines Augustine’s sinful youth and his journey towards redemption. It is often seen as laying the foundation of subsequent Christian theology and philosophy. The Confessions of Saint Augustine continues to be an important work today. Its timeless theme of redemption and faith in God’s plan still speaks to readers today, and it has remained a popular source of inspiration and an ode to finding peace of mind in one’s faith.",

    " The Villanovan culture was an early Iron Age culture of Early Central and Northern Italy. It was the first group of people to use iron technology in the region, and its rise marked the beginning of the Iron Age in Italy. They are believed to have been an indigenous group of peoples, as they precede the arrival of the more well-known Etruscans in the region by several centuries. Very little is known of the Villanovan culture, but the few artifacts that have survived from this period paint a vivid story of the unique culture of the Villanovans and their place in early European history. The Villanovans thrived in the Po River Valley in modern-day northern Italy. Their settlements were a mixture between a proto-urban culture and a more rural lifestyle of agricultural production, and they had a complex system of social organization. Burials have been found in which the Villanovans buried their dead under 4 layers of soil, the 4th of which was believed to contain the ashes of the deceased. The Villanovans had developed a unique style of pottery that differentiated them from the other Iron Age cultures of the region. They decorated their vases with intricate incision and combed patterns, and used geometric designs to decorate other vessels. They were also skilled metalworkers and were the first people to use iron in the region. They produced elaborate bronze scabbards for swords and axes and other items like wine-making vessels, zincite ornaments, and bronze sheets decorated with gold. The Villanovans seem to have been a peaceful society, as their artifacts reveal very little evidence of war. There is evidence that some of their settlements may have been burned or destroyed, but there is no clear way to tell who burned them. The Villanovans appear to have been absorbed or displaced by the Etruscans, who began to move into the region in the 8th century BCE. The Etruscans inherited many of the Villanovans’ artistic styles and techniques, as well as their pottery. It is likely that many of the Villanovans in the area were gradually assimilated into the Etruscan culture, effectively ending the Villanovan culture as it had been known. The legacy of the Villanovans remains an important part of Italian culture and history. Their unique art and metalworking techniques have been an influence on succeeding generations, and their influence can still be seen in modern Italian art and culture.",
    " The Tribe of Dan (Hebrew: דָּן‎) was one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. It is believed to be named after the grandson of Jacob and Leah. They were divided into two divisions, which became known as Danites and Danessites. The Tribe of Dan is mentioned in the Books of Numbers and Joshua. The Tribal Territory of Dan initially included the Eastern Shore of the Mediterranean Sea. This included the cities of Zorah, Timna, and its two associated cities, Dan, and Eltekeh. This area was later taken from the tribe of Dan and given to the tribe of Judah. The Tribe of Dan is associated with Judges chapter 18, in which the Danites are said to have gone against the commandment of God by stealing the shrine of the Micos and bringing it back to their home in Laish. This is said to have angered God, and He gave the Danites over to the Philistines. The Tribe of Dan is traditionally associated with ships. Their navy is said to have roamed the Mediterranean and traveled to far-away lands. Some believe that the Tribe of Dan was comprised of traders and merchants, while others believe they were skilled sailors. The Tribe of Dan is also associated with two Judges in the Bible: Samson and Eli. They both held the position of the High Priest and judge of the Israelites. Samson is said to have been chosen because of his strength and power. It is believed to have been his strength and courage that enabled him to fight and defeat the Philistines. Some believe that the Tribe of Dan was no longer politically strong after a civil war in the 7th century BC. It is believed that due to the lack of leadership and unity, the Tribe of Dan was broken away from the twelve tribes and did not regain its strength until the 12th century AD. Today, there are several Jewish organizations and communities that identify as the Tribe of Dan, bearing their name as a reminder of their connections to the ancient Israelites and their descendants. There are also Christian organizations that look to their shared faith as a reminder of their shared connection as Israelites, wherever they may be today.",

    " Yunganastes pluvicanorus is a species of large Myobatrachid frog, which is found only in Chile. It is an endemic species, preferring montanePatagonian shrubland habitat, between 700 and 1000 metres above sea level, in the southern central region of the Chile. It was first identified in 2007 by a team of Chilean biologists led by José Cotzillahue. Y. pluvicanorus is a medium-sized frog, typically measuring between 2 and 3.3 centimetres in length. It is brown on its dorsal side and pale yellow to light blue ventrally. It has large eyes and short legs, and its toes are partially webbed. The species prefers to inhabit cloudy, humid montane Patagonian shrubland, and is absent from nearby regions with similar habitat. Y. pluvicanorus reproduces by laying numerous (up to 1000+) eggs in a single mating event in the wet season and these are then guarded by the male until they hatch a few weeks later. Females have been observed to have multiple mates, which increases genetic variability and makes this species more robust. Conservation of Y. pluvicanorus is an important consideration due to its limited range. The species is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List. The key threats to the species are associated with the destruction of its montane habitat, due to deforestation and livestock grazing. conservation efforts include habitat protection, which is the primary management action for the species. Additionally, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in suitable locations have been proposed. Within Chile, Y. pluvicanorus may benefit from the increasing conservation interest in the recently described Patagonian species. These conservation efforts will require improved access to the remote montane habitats in which this species is found and increased recognition of the importance of conserving amphibians as key components of fragile Patagonian ecosystems.",

    " James Edmonstone (1818–1894) was a Scottish slave-owner, planter and abolitionist who became a prominent figure in the Portuguese colony of Salvador, Brazil. He was born in Ednaston, Scotland, the son of Alexander and Dorothy Edmonstone. In his youth, he became an apprentice at an indigo-making factory near Glasgow, and in 1837 he emigrated to Brazil, initially settling in Rio de Janeiro. He soon became a successful indigo producer in the eastern states, but by 1847 he had moved to the state of Bahia, where he was to become one of the largest slaveowners in Brazil. Edmonstone received his slave from Senhor Marques, a former senator from Minas Gerais, who had been convicted of illegal slave trading. James became one of the largest slave-owners in the region, owning over 500 slaves at one time. He purchased lands near Santo Amaro and began to cultivate sugar cane and produce indigo, which he then exported to Europe. Despite his slave-owning activities, Edmonstone was more progressive than his counterparts in the region and was heavily involved in the then-nascent abolition movement in Brazil. He spoke frequently on the subject of abolition, arguing that as a \"moral duty, we ought to take the part of slavery, wherever it exists.\" He was also instrumental in helping to create the first abolitionist newspaper in Brazil, the 'Voce de Liberdade', in 1848. His campaigning and work did much to help the cause, and by 1871 the Brazilian slave trade had ended, with all slaves within Brazil finally freed in 1888. James Edmonstone became one of the most successful and respected businesspeople in the Brazilian state of Bahia. His business interests continued to expand during the 1850s and '60s, and he was responsible for building many of the key infrastructure projects in the region such as roads, bridges and railroads. He was active in local politics, becoming a member of the Bahian Chamber of Deputies in 1868, and he also published several books and essays on slavery, the economy, and Brazil's history and culture. Despite his gradual rise to prominence within the local community, Edmonstone's life was not without its controversies. In 1871 he was forced to flee to Portugal after scandals relating to his slave-trading activities threatened to land him in prison. He spent a number of years in Lisbon and then moved to the town of Salvador, where he lived until his death in 1894. During his life, he made a huge impact on the economic, social and political landscape of Brazil, and his legacy lives on today in the many monuments, streets and buildings named in his honour across the country. As a result, he is remembered by many Brazilian historians as one of the greatest figures of abolitionism in Brazil, and a daring and pioneering champion of justice and human rights.",
    " Pornographic film, or adult film, is a genre of film that deals primarily with explicit sexual subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy an audience. Pornographic films were originally shot on film stock, but now they are made more commonly by video. In the United States, adult films are regulated by the Motion Picture Association of America. Most pornographic films must be classified as either softcore or hardcore as certain moral restrictions apply. Softcore films generally focus on nudity and other potentially suggestive sexual behavior, while hardcore films typically contain depictions of sexual intercourse and more explicit sexual activity. Many pornographic films focus on particular fetishes, such as bondage and discipline, spanking, and domination and submission, or activities such as lap dancing and mud wrestling. Others involve scenarios such as simulated rape. Documentary-style films have also been made about adult film stars, like the 2010 film Aroused. Pornography has often been subject to censorship and legal restrictions, both for moral and political reasons. In the US, obscenity laws have been used to suppress or restrict the sale or distribution of adult films since the 1960s. In recent decades, such restrictions have been relaxed, but adult films continue to be subject to varying degrees of censorship and control in some countries. Adult films are typically either rented or bought in the form of videotapes, DVDs, video discs, and online streaming. Movie theaters typically do not show adult films, though some exceptions to this rule do exist. In some countries, pornographic films are banned entirely. Pornographic films, while legally restricted, have been used for a variety of educational, therapeutic, and artistic purposes. The nudity and sex scenes in some movies can be used to portray situations in which conventional sexual taboos are challenged or subverted. In addition, sexually explicit artworks, such as the pornographic illustrations of Pompeii, have been preserved and continually inspires new generations of filmmakers.",
    " The Goldman child abduction case was a 1995 abduction, murder, and conviction of two men for the kidnapping and killing of a nine-year old United States citizen, Anju Goldman, in California. The child had been living in Butte County, California, with her family, and was forcibly taken against her will by the suspects who intended to ransom her for a substantial sum. The case began on August 11, 1995, when Anju Goldman disappeared while walking home from an ice cream shop in Oroville, California. Her body was eventually found in the Feather River near Oroville on October 8, 1995. Two men, 58-year-old Clarence Eugene \"Gene\" Evans and 59-year-old Paul Leslie Whiteacre, were arrested and charged with her abduction and murder. The trial began in November 1997 and Evans and Whiteacre were found guilty on all charges related to the abduction and murder. Evans was sentenced to life in prison without parole and Whiteacre was sentenced to life in prison with the potential for parole after 20 years. Mason Whiteacre, the brother of Paul Leslie Whiteacre, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the crime and served as a jail informant for authorities. The case drew national attention, due in part to the involvement of then-California Governor Pete Wilson, who called for a total of five million dollars from public and private organizations to fund the search for Anju. It also received media attention due to its grisly nature, as the suspects had planned to ransom the young girl before eventually killing her and disposing of her body in the Feather River. The case was seen as a wake up call to organizations, such as the Amber Alert, that are focused on finding missing children. It led to the introduction of tougher laws in California, making it easier to convict abductors and murderers of children. The Goldman case serves as an important reminder of the threats to children, and the need to remain vigilant in order to protect them.",

    " Sempronius Densus (born c. 361 AD) was a Roman soldier and part of a military unit known as the Protectores, who served the Roman Empire during the 3rd and 4th century AD. Densus is known for being the only member of his unit to survive the Battle of Adrianople, in which the Romans were defeated by the Goths in 378 AD. Densus was from the ancient city of Spalatum on the Adriatic coast of modern-day Croatia. He was part of the Protectores, a unit formed from Constantine's bodyguard, the Scholae Palatinae. Densus rose to prominence in the reign of Constantine I (306-337 AD). His unit was an elite, professional force that rode to battle in wagons, and wore white cloaks in battle, which served as a psychological deterrent. In 378 AD, the Roman army, under Emperor Valens, was defeated at the Battle of Adrianople, by a large army of Goths. Valens himself was killed leading the charge. Only Sempronius Densus and another soldier, Himilco, managed to survive the battle. It is believed that both men made their escape by hiding in a chariot and merging with the victorious Goth army. After the battle, it is believed that Densus and Himilco went their separate ways and no more is known of their ultimate fate. Densus appears to have survived long enough to be remembered in the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus, who mentions that he escaped the Battle of Adrianople and tells the story of how Densus and Himilco saved themselves. Densus’s courage and bravery were widely praised for centuries. As late as the 6th century AD, this courageous soldier was remembered as an example of courage and faithfulness to the Roman Empire. He was not just praised for surviving the battle, but was also respected for his courage and loyalty in a desperate situation. Today, Densus is remembered as a heroic figure, an example of bravery and true Roman spirit in a very dark period of history. He is an inspiration to everyone who faces a seemingly impossible task and is a reminder of the determination and courage that can enable a person to overcome even the most unfavourable circumstances.

    " Barend Dircksz (also known as Abraham and Adriaen Barendse, 1622–1698) was a 17th-century Dutch painter from Amsterdam who was best known for his portraiture and still life. He was born in Amsterdam, the son of a miller, and likely apprenticed for three years in the early 1640s with a local painter, although there have been no sketchbooks attributed to him. He married Marie Jacobsdr in June 1650 and the couple had two daughters and two sons. Dircksz is known to have produced small-scale portraits along with groups of three to five people, including those of the wealthy families of Amsterdam such as van der Hoeffs, Hartmannses, and De Ruyters. He often painted exclusively in brown tones as seen in his Portrait of Jan van Oostrum (1652). Favorite objects of his that featured in many of his paintings include musical instruments, books, maps, and vases. Among his still life works the 'Catalogue of Fruit and Dead Animals' stands out since it was done with a new technique in Southern Netherlands first introduced by Carel de Moucheron and Daniel Vorsterman. Dircksz was good friends with the other notable Amsterdam portraitists of the time, Govert Dircksz Camphuysen, Evert Jansz, and Adriaen Hanneman. All four created harsh images in comparison to the earlier Dutch painters who favored a more benign style of portraiture. In 1660 he was accepted into the Guild of St. Luke's, which was Amsterdam's Artist's Congregation, and in the same year he became a witness to the Treaty of The Hague between France and the Seven United Provinces. Barend Dircksz is widely considered one of the first innovators in the Dutch Golden Age of painting, and he had a great influence on the painters who followed him. One such painter was his student Adriaan Backer who created his own style of painting and the two collaborated on a piece together called Allegory of Vanity and Death (1664). His work is featured in many major Dutch art collections, including those of the Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Amsterdam Museum. The legacy of Barend Dircksz cannot be underestimated. His work was praised by critics throughout his lifetime and he remains one of the most important Dutch painters of the Golden Age. His innovative style and various portraits, still lifes, and allegorical pieces leave us a vivid depiction of Dutch life and the people who lived it.",
    " Formula One coverage on ITV is the long-running television coverage of the FIA Formula One World Championship shown on ITV in the United Kingdom. The backbone of the coverage is provided by the free-to-air broadcaster, ITV4, which has broadcast the majority of the sport since 1997, when Sky Sports' coverage of the sport was moved to the new channel. The coverage is based around world feed coverage of the races and post race analysis, originally presented by Steve Rider and Jim Rosenthal. In 1997, Steve Rider took the lead role in providing the coverage, including commentary, interviews and reporting on practice and qualifying sessions. Rider retired in 2004, and was replaced as presenter in 2005 by Jim Rosenthal and Louise Goodman. Commencing in 2007, the race day programmes were presented by Ted Kravitz alongside Mark Blundell. Martin Brundle was the lead commentator, with David Croft and Jonathan Legard providing analysis. Ted Kravitz and Louise Goodman provided expert insight into the technical aspects of each race. Steve Rider continued to provide features and interviews at the races, whilst Blundell provided commentary. In 2013, ITV Sport lost the rights to the BBC. As a result, the ITV commentary team was disbanded and the network began to rely on the Formula One Management for all broadcast output. Presenter responsibilities now vary, with all pit lane coverage being provided by the FOM.

    " A muzzleloader is a type of firearm that is loaded from the muzzle, or front end of the gun, as opposed to other types of firearms that are loaded from the chamber or magazine. Muzzleloaders were the first type of firearms ever used, dating back to the early 1500s when black powder was first used for gunpowder. Since then, muzzleloaders have gone through several advancements and are now used by hunters, muzzleloading enthusiasts, and historical re-enactors. Muzzleloader firearms use a wide range of projectile and powder charges, from .22 caliber to .50 caliber and black powder, Pyrodex, and substitutes like Triple Seven, Canadian Blackhorn 209, and 777. Muzzleloaders range from single-shot shotguns, to the traditional long guns (smooth and rifle barrels), to modern in-line rifles with internal magazines. Some muzzleloaders have composite stocks, like a rifle, while others are more traditionally styled with wooden stocks and other features. Muzzleloader pistols are also available and can be used both recreationally and in historical reenactments. Traditionally, muzzleloaders were traditionally loaded with loose black powder and round lead balls, with a few drops of lubricant applied over the balls to aid in loading. Muzzleloader projectiles now range from round lead balls, to conical and sabot-style bullets, and even Saboted Light Armor Piercing (SLAP) ammunition. Traditionally, muzzleloaders were ignited by a flintlock or percussion cap, although newer models are now available with an electric ignition system. Muzzleloaders can be used for target practice, hunting, and competition shooting. As with other types of firearms, muzzleloading firearms require a certain amount of knowledge, skill, and caution for proper and safe usage. Rules and regulations vary from state to state, so it is important to become familiar with the laws in your area. Muzzleloader firearms have been around for centuries, and have provided much enjoyment to hunters and enthusiasts alike. While they are not as powerful or accurate as modern firearms, they are still able to provide a unique and interesting shooting experience with their classic appearance and operation. So if you're looking for a great way to get back to the basics, a muzzleloader can provide you with a great way to get started in the shooting sports.",
    " The 1982 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team represented the University of Notre Dame during the 1982 NCAA Division I-A football season. The team was led by fourth-year head coach Gerry Faust. In his fourth and final season, Faust's Fighting Irish posted an 8–4 record and accepted the invitation to play in the Liberty Bowl. In the second quarter of their regular season game against Georgia Tech, Notre Dame sophomore quarterback Steve Beuerlein threw a 45-yard Hail Mary pass to freshman tight end Gary Godsey, giving the Fighting Irish a 17-14 lead. The play became known as the \"Pass to Win\" moment and is remembered by many as one of Notre Dame's greatest football highlights. The Fighting Irish started their season with a pair of victories over Purdue and LSU. Three consecutive losses to McGrath scored by junior Jerome Heavens, Michigan, and Air Force however quickly turned the season sour. Notre Dame bounced back with victories over Colorado, Boston College, and Navy to hold the record at 5-3. Victories over Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech at home before Notre Dame squared off against USC in what would be Gerry Faust's last game as head coach at Notre Dame. Down 18–17 late in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame missed out on the opportunity for a 24-yard field goal and lost the game. The Fighting Irish finished the season with a record of 8-4 and their fourth consecutive bowl appearance. They went on to lose the Liberty Bowl to North Carolina 10–9, in what would have been the first ten win season for Notre Dame since 1974. In the end, the 1982 Fighting Irish football season would be the last loss in Gerry Faust's tenure, and the final season with the assistant coach Lou Holtz, who assumed head coaching duties in the following season. With a victory in the Liberty Bowl, the Fighting Irish would have finished the season ranked eleventh in the final AP Poll. Instead, they finished the season unranked with an 8-4 record and ended the year tied for twentieth in the final AP Poll with two consecutive losses.",

    " Oliver Beer (born in 1983) is a French British contemporary artist known for his multimedia works featuring a range of media, including sound, sculpture, performance, installation, and film. Beer studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London and later obtained his Masters in Fine Art from the Royal College of Art in London. Beer's works often explore abstract concepts and consider the subjective experience of space. Through his work, Beer attempts to create a \"continuum of sensory awareness\". He is interested in decay and transformation and his works often center around considering the same phenomena from multiple perspectives. Beer has been widely exhibited internationally, including exhibitions at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, Documenta 14 in Athens, and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris.

    " Kanreki dohyō-iri is a Shinto ceremony in Japan to mark a person's 60th birthday. The word “Kanreki” is a combination of two characters: “reen (憐)” and “kei (慶)”, meaning “sympathy and joy.” It is a time of reflection and celebration as the person marks the end of their sixth 10-year cycle and the beginning of the next. This ceremony is rooted in the Buddhist tradition of celebrating one's 60th birthday as significant and marks the sixth cycle of the traditional Japanese life expectancy (20 to 80). The term is frequently used to describe other Japanese ceremonies associated with reaching a certain age. At the beginning of the ceremony, a congratulatory rice cake is presented, representing the milestone achieved. A paper called “Shichi-go-san” (seven-five-three) is also given and consists of characters written with a specific brush and ink. The characters signify the intended wishes of happiness and health for the recipient. The celebrant then performs the dohyō-iri. The dohyō-iri is a symbolic gesture of ascending the steps to the top of a mountain shrine and the traditional costume of bright red and white clothing is worn for the ritual. Incense and sake are then offered to the gods as part of the purification of the soul. The celebration ends with the cutting of a 60th birthday cake in the shape of the kanji character for “old”. Kanreki dohyō-iri is practiced by many Japanese people, as a way of celebrating their passing of life’s stages. It has also been adopted by non-Japanese people who have embraced the traditional Japanese way of life. Kanreki dohyō-iri is an important part of Shinto tradition and is still observed by many families today, albeit in a modernised way. It is a time of renewal and joy and symbolises the start of a new cycle of life.",

    " The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln was a historic event that took place on September 22, 1862. The proclamation declared that all persons held as slaves within the Confederate states would be declared free. This document was the legal precursor to the Thirteenth Amendment, which officially abolished slavery throughout the United States. The Emancipation Proclamation was drafted by President Abraham Lincoln and later shared with his Cabinet members. At the time, the attention of the country was largely focused on the Antietam Campaign, which was seen as a potentially decisive battle in the Civil War. Lincoln, however, wanted to issue a document that would make clear the United States’ intention to abolish slavery. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln delivered the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to the Cabinet. Present were the Secretary of State, William Seward; the Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase; the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles; the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton; and the Attorney General, Edward Bates. The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation was a dramatic and emotional moment for Lincoln and the other members of the Cabinet. Lincoln stated that “in giving freedom to the slaves, we assure freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.” He also read an excerpt of the document, saying that “all persons held as slaves within any state, or designated part of a state, the people of which shall be in rebellion against the United States, shall be thenceforward and forever free.” Although it would take some time for the Thirteenth Amendment to be ratified, the First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation was a monumental event in American history. It was the first action taken by the federal government to begin the process of abolishing slavery, and it ultimately paved the way for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. Despite the delay in ratification, it demonstrates that the President, and the country more broadly, wanted to take action in order to end the nation’s “peculiar institution.”",

    " Castillo de San José, also known as Fort San José, is a historic fort located on Corazón de Tierra Island in the La Paz municipality of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. The fort was built by the Spanish in 1705 to protect the territory of La Paz from invaders and pirates, who were a constant threat to the area at the time. The fort is made up of two parts: the land-side fort, which consists of an outer stone wall and an inner brick wall, and the sea-side fort, which consists of six bastions and protected the beach where ships would anchor. The walls of the land-side fort were constructed with locally-made mortars and bricks, while the sea-side fort was built with good stone. The fort was designed to house up to 400 soldiers, in addition to the cannons, guns, and artillery that defended the fortress. Inside the land-side fort, there were barracks, officers' quarters, a parade ground, and even a chapel dedicated to St. Joseph, from whom the fort derives its name. The fort served its purpose for over two centuries, although it fell into disrepair in the 19th century. In 1965, the fort was declared a Historical Monument of Mexico and efforts began to restore it to its former glory. Today, the fort is one of the most visited sites in La Paz, and tours are available to visitors who want to explore the fortress and learn about its history. The fort serves as a reminder of the importance of La Paz and its role in protecting the territory of Mexico during its colonial period.

    " Zu was an ancient Sumerian thunder god, as well as the god of weather, sky, and storms. He was often depicted holding a double edged axe and a bow, identifying him as a warrior god. He was associated with Erra, Ishum, and Adad. In addition, Zu was also sometimes given the epithet “king of the mountains”, implying that he controlled the power of the mountains. Some of Zu's primary roles were to protect the gods in their palaces and bestow rain upon the city of Nippur so that the land could be fertile and productive. During the Sumerian epic known as The Lament for Ur, Zu was condemned for stealing the Tablet of Destiny from the gods, resulting in them losing control of humankind. In Sumerian mythology, Zu was a powerful figure. He was known as the king of the birds and the protector of the divine kingship. He was sometimes considered to be the messenger of the gods, responsible for delivering the decrees of the gods to mankind. In some stories, Zu was said to have had a magical weapon, called the zicar, which was said to have the power to strike down evil at the behest of the gods. Zu was also said to have had divine attributes and powers, such as being able to raise up armies, grant oracles and be an avenger of the gods. He was described as a furious god, often unleashing great storms upon mankind. Some ancient religions also attributed creation and destruction to his power, suggesting that he was a powerful force for balance and justice. In art, Zu was often depicted alongside goddess Inanna, denoting their shared roles as warriors and leaders. He was occasionally depicted with the wings of a storm bird and the head of a lion. This form was used to illustrate his apocalyptic powers. As a cultural figure, Zu was a source of veneration and celebration in Sumerian culture.

    " Megalopalpus zymna, also known by its common name, the yellow-headed beer moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Crambidae. It is found across much of the Palearctic ecozone, ranging from parts of Europe to Central Asia and Siberia. It is particularly common in Central Europe, most notably in Germany and Austria. M. zymna moths typically measure between 14 and 18 mm in length, and feature a distinctive yellow head and base of the antennae. Their wings are a rich orange chestnut color, marked with some darker shading around the edges. On either side of the wings, a white, \"L-shaped\" pattern is visible, but more prominent in the males than in the females. The larvae of M. zymna feed on a variety of grasses and cereals, although they are most commonly found on barley and wheat. Additionally, they can be found on the leaves and stems of other cereal plants, such as oats, rye and maize. In Germany, the larvae are an important pest species, and considerable damage can be done to agricultural fields and grain stores. Adult M. zymna are typically active between June and October in most regions, although they can sometimes be found earlier in the season in southern parts of their range. After mating, the females lay their eggs on the leaves and stems of cereal plants, and the larvae emerge after around two weeks. They feed for approximately six weeks before pupating, developing into adult moths shortly afterwards. The larvae are subject to natural predators, including the predaceous midge Tanytarsus lateralis, which feeds exclusively on M. zymna larvae. Additionally, a number of parasitoid wasps, such as Oomyzus sokolowskii and Microplitis mediator, have been identified as natural enemies of the species. As a result of such natural control, large-scale population outbreaks of M. zymna are relatively rare. The species has also been known to be controlled through the usage of chemical pesticides, but more often by the destruction of crop residues and good hygiene practices, such as the removal of infested plant material from the fields. Biological control has also been employed in some areas, with various species of Trichogramma wasps being released to reduce the population size of M. zymna. In addition to its agricultural pest status, M. zymna is also regarded as an important pollinator species in many parts of Europe, pollinating cereal crops such as barley and wheat.This valuable role in crop production is generally overlooked, due to the species' status as an agricultural pest. Today, Megalopalpus zymna continues to be an important species in many areas across the Palearctic ecozone, with its agricultural pest status tightly intertwined with its role as a valuable crop pollinator. Despite the potential damage it can cause to cereal crops, the species remains an invaluable part of the region's ecosystem, and should be respected accordingly. ",

    " Edward Curr (1798-1850) was an English-born Australian pioneer and landholder. He was born in Hipperholme, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. He migrated to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1824, to capitalize on the free grants of land available to emigrants. Curr was the eldest son of Richard Curr and his wife Elizabeth, née Crabtree. Curr was very active in the early development and growth of Australia's fledgling pastoral industry, and established successful runs in Victoria and South Australia. He made numerous journeys around Victoria and New South Wales, and was one of the first English explorers to cross overland from Van Diemen's Land to the mainland. In 1835, Curr explored the country south-west of Port Philip (now Melbourne) and named the area Western Port district. Curr's explorations generally involved scouring the countryside for suitable land for sheep grazing. As well as exploring and developing land for Australia's wool industry, Curr saw the potential for capitalizing on the Trans-Australian railway in the early 1830s. He leased and purchased several large land properties in the Port Phillip district, and established a successful trading post in the region. This post specialized in supplying produce and wares to remote settlements in the area. In 1836, Curr was appointed gunner of Port Fairy and, later, of Portland district. He also successfully managed a number of properties that he had acquired in the region. Curr was the driving force behind the establishment of a sawmill at Port Fairy, and is credited with introducing the first barley and potatoes to the area. In addition to his profitable venture in trading and land acquisitions, Curr was a leading figure in the development of education in the region. He established and endowed a school for boys and girls in Port Fairy in 1856. In 1845, his wife, Mary, established the Edward Curr Children's Home in Rupanyup. The Catholic order of St. Patricks, which ran the home, provided a midpoint between the convict settlements and the frontiers of the new colonies. In death, Curr left a considerable estate, which included grazing and dairying properties, sawmills, and country store businesses. He is remembered as a pioneer and capitalist who played an important role in the development of early Australian pastoralism. He was honoured in the naming of Victorian towns, including Currie, a township in the Wimmera Region in Victoria. Curr died in Portland, Victoria on 13 December 1850. He was survived by his wife and seven children.",

    " Cambodia–India relations refer to the bilateral relations between India and Cambodia. Diplomatic ties between the two countries date back to a friendly cultural and trade exchange through the 1st century AD, when Cambodian troops aided King Ashoka in his battles. India recognized Cambodia's independence from France in 1953 and established diplomatic relations in the same year. India has provided small-scale economic and military assistance to Cambodia, while economic relations between the two countries are minimal. India was one of the first countries to set up a diplomatic mission in Cambodia during the post-independence period. The then Minister, Pran Nath Thapar, opened the India-Cambodia diplomatic mission in 1954. This diplomatic mission was an expression of India's trust, friendship and cooperation with the newly independent Cambodian nation. The then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk made exchanges during 'Festival of India' held in the year 1959 in Phnom Penh. India is considered a major supporter and friend of Cambodia in the international arena. It supported the inclusion of Cambodia in ASEAN and was also a major participant in the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia (UNTAC) which administered the 1993 elections in Cambodia. India is currently the second largest provider of financial assistance to Cambodia since the formation of the government in 1993. It has contributed US$ 3 million since 1993 and a further US$ 4 million in 2010 for Cambodia's development projects. The Government of India is also actively promoting investment by Indian companies in Cambodia. India increased its aid to Cambodia as a gesture of friendship and goodwill to focus on education, health and agricultural sectors. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has also been signed between India and Cambodia. India also provides assistance in capacity building in the fields of agriculture, rural development, IT and communications. Dialogues between India and Cambodia are focussed on strengthening bilateral cooperation. The two countries discussed cooperation in areas such as energy, health, education, agricultural development, tourism, and culture, among others.

    " Kue cubit, also known as Kue pancong, is a traditional Indonesian snack originating in the city of Jogjakarta. It is a type of deep-fried cake made from rice flour, water, coconut milk and palm sugar, featuring a light sweet taste with a crispy golden-brown crust. The name \"Kue cubit\" literally translates as \"fingers cake\". It derives from the way it is traditionally eaten; diners using their fingers to break the small cubes of cake into smaller pieces and dip them into a liquid accompaniment. Kue cubit is enjoyed as a dessert or snack throughout Indonesia, although it is most popular in Yogyakarta and the eastern Java region. It is usually sold as a street food, especially in tourist spots and night markets. The most popular accompaniment to kue cubit is a dark black syrup made from palm sugar and pandan extract, giving the cake a fragrant and subtly sweet taste. Other accompaniments range from rich condensed milk to spicy sambal or savory seafood toppings. Kue cubit remains a common snack item in most areas of Indonesia. It is commonly served during festive occasions such as Eid al-Fitr, and is often served as part of a buffet spread. The cakes can be purchased ready-made from individual vendors, or freshly made via a kue cubit machine; a specialized device consisting of two hot griddles on which a premade paste of the ingredients is pressed into thin cubes. Kue cubit is thought to have evolved from the traditional Chinese youtiao, a deep-fried savory snack, which was previously popular in parts of Indonesia. It is believed to have been influenced by the Dutch colonization of the archipelago, with the introduction of palm sugar, leading to the cakes being crafted with a sweeter flavor profile become more prominent. Today, there are many variations of kue cubit around Indonesia, from sweetened to savory, with fillings such as egg and cheese, chocolate, and durian. Kue cubit can be eaten for breakfast as well as for dessert, and adapted for a wide range of occasions.

    " Flags of Norwegian subdivisions refers to the various flags which are specifically used to represent the Norwegian subnational entities of the country. Norwegian subnational entities consist of the country's 19 administrative regions and 430 municipalities. The majority of these flags, especially for the administrative regions, belong to the Nordic Cross style. The usage of flags for the Norwegian subnational entities started off with simple banners, emblems and logos. As the usage of flags began to slowly spread, more advanced designs were adopted with intricate symbols and colours. The current flags used for the administrative regions all consist of the Nordic Cross style pattern. The colours used in these flags are inspired by the national colours of Norway, while the symbols normally depict regional characteristics, such as mountains and other local features. The Norwegian Flag Law of 1980 established a set of regulations and guidelines for the use of flags for the municipalities in Norway. It required municipalities to register any flag designs with the police before being allowed to use it officially. According to the law, all municipal flags must have the municipality's name written below the Nordic Cross style and the colours must not clash with those used in the country's flag. Additionally, a municipal banner can only be used officially if it has been approved by the municipality. The law also placed several restrictions in the context of the use of banners, including the banning of any religious symbols. This resulted in the banning of the flags of traditional Norwegian Sami communities as they normally include symbols of Norse paganism. Despite being guided by the same regulations and having similar design styles, each municipality's flag is unique to its particular area. The range of elements differ depending on the region, with some showing the country's national colours along with their own and others displaying specific patterns, such as criss-crossed lines. Today, flags of Norwegian subnational entities are used in a variety of settings such as on front doors, car windows and public buildings. They represent the country's diverse regions and provide a visual representation of Norwegian identity and culture. References 1.

    " An Inconvenient Tax is an economic tax policy idea proposed by renowned economists Steve Fazzari and William Gale in 2017 as an alternative to both traditional tax cuts and the basic health care and national safety net programs. An Inconvenient Tax is the concept of increasing taxes on people with higher incomes, such as those earning more than $250,000 or $500,000 annually. This increase would offset some or all of the cost of providing health insurance and national safety net programs. The idea of An Inconvenient Tax is to create a tax structure better configured to support necessary social and economic policies, including health care, education, and job training. It would also put more of the tax burden on wealthier households, despite their smaller amounts of taxable income, in order to increase revenues and reduce income inequality. Supporters argue that An Inconvenient Tax would be more effective at increasing revenue, reducing inequality, and increasing funding for key social services than traditional tax reform policies. Moreover, they contend that the new tax structure would be more equitable and would help alleviate poverty and its associated problems. Additionally, they suggest the tax structure would make it easier to finance public investment such as infrastructure projects that could potentially boost the economy. Critics worry that implementing the An Inconvenient Tax would cause wealthy households to reduce their spending, resulting in decreased investment and fewer job opportunities. Additionally, it may be difficult to track how much money wealthy households actually owe to the federal government. Despite concerns over implementation and impact, the idea of An Inconvenient Tax continues to gain attention from policy makers and economists. They argue that it could be an effective means of helping fund social services, reducing income inequality, and providing more market assurance to middle and lower income households. The policy though will require careful implementation if it is to be successful.",
    " Arengo and Freedom is a project born out of the belief that freedom of speech should not be limited to any gender, race, class, or nationality. This project encourages constructive dialogue and diverse perspectives from both sides of the debate. It promotes mutual understanding and an appreciation of the necessity of both personal freedoms and the rule of law. The project was founded in 2018 by two women in the United States: Natalie Williams and Leah Long. They saw that while much public discourse dealt with socio-economic and political issues, there was a lack of open debate and dialogue on themes related to personal freedoms. This led to the creation of Arengo and Freedom. The project focuses on three main ideas: a free space for dialogue, responsible free expression, and democratic action. It encourages people to engage in open and honest conversations, regardless of political boundaries, in order to find common ground, even when there are disagreements. Arengo and Freedom provides a platform for both heated debates and thoughtful exchanges. There are Facilitated Conversations, Debates, and Workshops. Facilitated Conversations focus on generating understanding through respectful dialogue, and Debates provide a platform for a structured argument. Workshops are based on the principles of energy democracy and collaborative democracy, aiming to creating a culture of mutual learning and respect. Arengo and Freedom also works to build collaboration between civil society organizations, governments, and other groups. Currently the project is funded by private donors and it is planning to work with the public sector in order to increase the project’s capacity to reach a wider range of social actors. Arengo and Freedom has been featured in international and domestic publications, including Huffington Post, The Guardian, and Medium. It is seen as a champion of freedom of speech and a platform to challenge conservative culture and power structures. The mission of the project remains to create a vibrant space for meaningful conversations, respectful dialogue, and the expression of diverse ideas. As stated by one of the project’s founders, Leah Long: “The Arengo and Freedom project focuses on creating a positive, inclusive space for free people to have memorable conversations and take action. People learn more when they talk to each other, rather than about each other.”",

    " Hurricane Harvey was one of the most destructive and powerful hurricanes to affect the United States in recorded history. It was a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale that made landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25, 2017. It then weakened as it moved back out over water and ended up making a second landfall near Cameron, Louisiana on August 30. Harvey caused an estimated US$125 billion in damage, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. In total, the storm damaged or destroyed more than 203,000 homes and other structures and disrupted the lives of more than 13 million people. The storm’s impacts began before it made landfall, as Harvey lingered in the coastal waters off the Texas coast for almost a week, bringing torrential downpours and flooding in its wake. This extended period brought an estimated 30-40 inches of rainfall to portions of the Houston-Galveston region over a four-day period. Over the course of just five days, some areas of Houston recorded more than 50 inches of rain. The impact was almost universal, as flooding damaged or destroyed homes and other infrastructure throughout much of southeastern Texas and western Louisiana. Over 50 counties and parishes declared disasters in the wake of the storm, and the damage to the energy sector extended to oil refineries, pipelines and offshore oil platforms. In the end, Hurricane Harvey had dropped a record-breaking total of more than 60 inches of rain near Nederland, Texas, making it the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the continental United States. This, combined with the estimated 214 billion gallons of rain that fell in the state, resulted in wide-scale and lasting damage throughout Texas. In response to the disaster, government entities, businesses and charitable organizations provided aid to both individuals and communities affected by the storm. A number of celebrities also donated to those in need and held fundraising events. Moving forward, officials are now considering changes to building codes and infrastructure in order to reduce the impacts of future storms.",

    " Sophronia primella is a species of moth belonging to the family Oecophoridae, which was first described by Möschler in 1860. The species is widely distributed in the Caribbean, parts of the United States (Arizona and Florida, for example) and feeds on the larva of the witchhazel leaf beetle and other small-sized insects. The adult moths are most active from April to June and can be found hovering near shrubs during the night. The wingspan of the species spans from 10 to 12 mm, with the overall appearance of the moth being yellowish or buff colored. The bodies of Sophronia primella are very small and slender, with the antennae being highly visible. Their wings are dark brown with white and yellow transverse lines, and the Hindwings being darker brown than the forewings. The size of the moth also makes it an ideal candidate for biocontrol of the witchhazel leaf beetle and other small-sized beetles. The caterpillars of the Sophronia primella feed on the leaves of a wide range of host plants, such as elm, ash, maple and hawthorn. This can cause extensive damage to the trees, which is why the caterpillars are sometimes used as a form of biocontrol to minimise their impacts on trees. Inspecting and controlling populations of Sophronia primella is necessary in order to prevent any economic or environmental damage to host plants, as well as any other damage caused by the caterpillars. The adult moths may be collected using light traps, while the caterpillars can be easily identified and controlled with various insecticides. In addition to its control use, Sophronia primella has been increasingly receiving attention from the scientific community due to its potential application in biomedical and biotechnological research. Research is ongoing on the potential uses of the species’ extract for drug delivery and medical device coatings, as well as its development for enzyme inhibition and cell biology research. Sophronia primella is an interesting and important species due to its wide geographic distribution and potential use in research, as well as its use for controlling the populations of other beetle species. Controlling its populations is necessary to prevent any further damage to host plants, as well as increasing awareness on the potential uses for the species in biotechnology and medicine.",

    " Net material product (NMP) is an economic measure of the value of material commodities produced in an economy during a period of time. It is calculated by subtracting the value of material inputs (material consumption) from the total value of output (net output). The NPM measures material production excluding the value of other production factors, such as labour and capital. NMP is seen as a key measure of an economy's material intensity, which can be used to assess an economy's overall sustainability. NMP is used in economic analysis and policy evaluation, such as economic development, health, and environmental analysis. NMP is calculated as the difference between total net output and total material inputs in an accounting period. It includes both materials and energy inputs and excludes capital inputs, labor inputs, and services. NMP is characterized by its coverage of inputs, output, and changes in material stocks. It also captures the flow of inputs and outputs across time and between areas. NMP can be used to measure the performance of a nation or region over time and to compare the performance of different nations or regions. The NMP measures the total value of materials that are used in a production process and excludes the intangible factors that are used to create a product, such as research and development costs. This measure helps to identify the amount of labor, energy, and resources used to create a product as well as how much value has been added to a product during the production process. NMP is calculated in two ways. The direct method is based on the value of physical outputs and the value of materials inputs. The indirect method estimates NMP by subtracting the value of the downstream inputs from the value of the upstream outputs. NMP is a useful measure for assessing an economy's material efficiency and productivity. It provides a simplified way to measure the output and efficiency of an economy and can be used to compare different nations or regions over time. It can also be used to understand the amount of material that is used in the production of a good, and how this impact the local and global environment. NMP is also seen as an important tool for monitoring the potential negative impacts of globalisation on resource use and sustainability. It has been used by governments and international organisations, such as the World Bank, to assess the sustainability of a country’s economic development. It can be used to determine the level of resource efficiency and identify potential areas of improvement in the production process.",
    " Paul of Taranto (died 941) was a Lombard prince who succeeded his father Arduin of Italy as the margrave of the March of Taranto from 924. He is also sometimes referred to as Paul-Arduinus. He was born in Italy, the son of Arduin of Italy and a daughter of Berengar I, King of Italy. At the time, the Lombard power in southern Italy was in decline, and the southern regions were under the influence of the Byzantine Empire. In 924, upon the death of his father, Paul succeeded him as the margrave of the March of Taranto. Despite his position as the official leader of the duchy, Paul spent much of his reign under the influence of other Lombard lords, including Adalbert I of Benevento. During his reign, Paul's authority was largely limited to southern Apulia and, by 935, Basil II of the Byzantine Empire had gained control of nearly all of Lombard Italy. Despite this, Paul was able to maintain a degree of independence for the Taranto region. To consolidate his position, he married a daughter of Sico I of Benevento in 926. Paul died in circa 941 and was succeeded as margrave by his brother Giselbert of Ratchis, husband of Willa, daughter of Guy II Tenebrion of Liguria. Paul was an able administrator and appears to have kept the March of Taranto in a relatively stable state during his reign, despite the chaotic situation in the rest of Lombard Italy. He is briefly mentioned in several contemporary sources and is credited with founding the Church of Santa Maria in 922. He is remembered today as a capable leader with a strong sense of duty. He is commemorated in the form of a statue in the town of Taranto.",

    " The Kraichgau Railway (German: Kraichgau-Bahn) is a short, but of major importance, railway line in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, running from Heidelberg via Sinsheim, Wiesloch-Walldorf, and Zaberfeld to Bretten and connecting to the Mannhei–Stuttgart line near Auerbach. The Kraichgau Railway follows the Kraichgau, the region southwest of Heidelberg, which was already served by steam trains at the end of the 19th century. It is 108km long and is one of the most important and heavily used north–south lines in Germany, with a total of 55 trains per hour. It is part of the geocentric principle of railway construction and also improves the public transport connection in the densely populated area. The line was electrified in 1908 and was fully double-tracked in 1933. Before the Second World War, a maximum of 1,000 freights per day were handled on tracks and bridges. After the war, the entire railway was reconstructed and the line became an important regional railway. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Kraichgau Railway line saw the introduction of new rolling stock, such as the VT98 and VT98a – DMUs (Diesel multiple units), as well as the more recent Desiro ML and Vario D50 EMUs (Electric multiple units). In 2007, between Zaberfeld and Güglingen, the now-defunct Kraichgaugleise (\"Kraichgau Tracks\") were opened. They were used by freight trains and limited passenger services between Weinheim and Hockenheim. The Kraichgau Railway is operated by DB Regio AG and is served by DB Regional-Express and Regionalbahn service. The line is the main rail connection between Heidelberg and Heilbronn and is a major route for commuters between the two cities. Furthermore, it connects the region north of Heidelberg with Mannheim and Stuttgart, as well as to Karlsruhe. In December 2008, the renovation of the track and station facilities of the Kraichgau Railway was completed. This renovation included a refurbishment of the track and the replacement of signalling systems. In 2013, a modernisation of the railway was announced by the Deutsche Bahn. The project was planned to include the conversion of the line from Wiesloch-Walldorf to the double-track starting point at Heidelberg-Schlierbach and the construction of a new station at Wiesloch-Hohensachsen. The modernisation of the Kraichgau Railway is part of the 'HomeRail Region' project, which is the German federal government's initiative to modernise the railway network and infrastructure in Germany. This investment will improve the service for passengers and freight services and provide direct access to the Mannheim–Stuttgart high-speed railway. The modernisation project was completed in June 2016 and is now in full operation. The new line enables more direct travel times and increased capacities. The Kraichgau Railway is an essential artery of the regional railway network and plays an important role in providing efficient public transport for the densely populated area."
