    "Cambodia and India share traditional bonds of proximity and friendship, exemplified by the strong and consistent support that both countries' governments have provided for each other in the various multilateral fora they are members of, particularly the South East Asia Association for Regional Integration (SEARIAI) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). In the arena of bilateral ties, the two countries have a range of economic and people-to-people ties, with around 35,000 Indian citizens residing in Cambodia, constituting the largest Indian community in a non-Chinese language-speaking country. India is the second largest trading partner of Cambodia, and the two sides have entered into an agreement for a Trade and Investment Promotion Agreement, aiming to provide further bolster their economic relations. Additionally, India was one of the first countries to offer emergency assistance to Cambodia in the wake of the 2003earthquake, with Indian military forces participating in the US-led Kaiserslautern air mission in support of the humanitarian disaster response effort in Cambodia, and India continuing to extend assistance to the country through its National Rural Health Mission. Despite the large volume of diplomatic relations between the two states, the challenge of peacefully resolving the current dispute regarding the nationality of the Cambodian King, who has been sought to be returned to Cambodia by the government of India and who has returned to India in recent years, has seen the cooling of relations in recent times. However, there are ongoing exchanges between the two countries' officials at various levels, such as when Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Cambodia in February 2018.",
    "Lunar-A is a concept for a future spacecraft launched by the United States to the Moon. The spacecraft would be stationed at the South Pole of the Moon, where there is a hydrogen gas deposit that could be used for propulsion and fuel. The mission of Lunar-A would be to transport goods and people between the Earth and the Moon, with a goal of becoming the first country to put citizens on the Moon. The United States believes that having the ability to send material and people to the Moon will encourage exploration and learning about the Moon's natural resources and history, and create a pathway for landing people from other countries on the Moon. The United States initiated the National Space Society's Lunar-A campaign in December 2019 to promote public support for the mission and funding for its development. ThomasAQ Sheard, the former Chief Technologist of the United States Air Force, is leading the mission's development as President and Chief Operating Officer. The mission is planned to be launch in the second half of the 2030s. Lunar-A will help deliver and support the missions of other spacecraft on the Moon, including deploying surface landers and rovers, prospecting for water, carrying out science, and using the lunar north pole for solar power and radio communication. It will also serve as a technology testbed for advanced components and systems. Lunar-A is the first moonshot campaign of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which supported the mission. The United States plans to submit a grant proposal to the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) to launch a commercial vehicle in the Artemis I mission in 2023 to demonstrate the ability to launch large payloads to the Moon.",
    "Automatic weather stations, also known as unattended weather stations, unattended monitoring stations, or unattended surveillance stations, are weather stations that automatically take meteorological measurements, and often temperatures, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, UV index and light intensity. They may also take atmospheric pressure, geospatial information, or satellite data. These measurements are typically sent to a computer network, a Weather Landmark, or to a local internet server. The measurements are used for local weather forecasting and often for severe weather forecasts. A sensor platform may also be used to detect light, wind or humidity, and may include a camera for photogrammetry, allowing 3D modeling of the surrounding area. Some automatic weather stations monitor air quality using sensors for sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen. Some also monitor UV Index using radiation sensors. Since 2014, a number of new solid state sensors have been developed for measuring air pollution. They include sensors for lead, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, mercury, benzene, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Some automatic weather stations monitor environmental conditions, such as barometric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, UV index, wind speed, wind direction, light intensity, barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, UV index, wind speed, wind direction, light intensity, and greenhouse gases. WeatherBug is an example of a manufacturer of automatic weather stations. An internet server can be set up to provide local weather forecasts based on data from automatic weather stations. Weather bugs can be hard to program, so many commercial and DIY weather stations use open hardware web servers based on Raspberry Pi computers. Home weather stations are often small computers with a display and a few sensors. Weather monitors are similar but have a larger display and more sensors, and may be connected to a home network for monitoring multiple sensors and sending notifications when sensor values trigger a rule. Weather monitors and home weather stations are often designed to be standalone devices with limited or no cellular data or Wi-Fi connectivity. Most commercial weather stations are connected to the internet through a computer network, a Weather Landmark, to allow more sophisticated data collection and storage, automatic weather notifications, remote monitoring and control, and local weather forecasting. WeatherLandmark.com allows access to many commercial Weather Landmarks connected to WeatherBug, Icon Intelligence, Skytrackers, and Netatmo, among others. Law enforcement agencies, military personnel, and outdoor enthusiasts can buy commercial Weather Landmarks which are not open to the public, allowing more extensive weather monitoring and wider access to remote-accessed data and advanced local weather forecasting. Examples of commercial Weather Landmarks include those offered by Mesa, Arizona-based manufacturer Logiweather, which has satellite, air and moisture monitoring capabilities, and includes the ability to provide local weather forecasts; and Texas-based Weather Defender, which also offers advanced local weather and climate forecasting, including severe weather alerts and tornado tracking. Mesa and Weather Defender offer Landmark-accessed weather data to WeatherBug, Icon Intelligence, and Netatmo, among others. WeatherBug offers data from many Weather Landmarks, plus community-developed WeatherBug accounts, through its WeatherBug Weather API, including reports of live and historical data, along with maps of observed conditions. OpenWeatherMap.org also allows access to WeatherBug, Icon Intelligence, and Netatmo, among others, with free access to Icon Intelligence, Netatmo, and Mesa. OpenWeatherMap.org also displays conditions and forecasts from many WeatherBug accounts, as well as user-submitted reports. Internet access is required to collect data from WeatherBug, Icon Intelligence, Skytrackers, and Netatmo. Collecting and using automatic weather data for personal or commercial purposes is legal if the data is not published. Publishing data that originates from WeatherBug, Icon Intelligence, or Netatmo, or using data to locate yourself without proper permission can result in civil or criminal penalties.

    "Greek Americans, a people of Greek ancestry, have a long history in Metro Detroit. Between 1881 and 1931 over one million Greek immigrants came to America, the vast majority of them settled in the New York City area, a smaller amount of people settled in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and a smaller amount still settled in the Metro Detroit area. A significant amount of these Greek immigrants came from the region of Central Greece known as Macedonia, today the people of this region are known as Greeks in America. The first Greeks in America came to the Metro Detroit area, now known as Detroit, in 1881. This first wave of Greeks included farmers, entrepreneurs, professionals, and artists. Since the 1990s Greeks have made up one of the largest immigrant communities in the Detroit metropolitan area. In the years 1881 to 1931 a total of 1,063,224 Greeks came to America, of which only906,160 settled in the United States, 203,880 settled in Canada, and 40,256 settled in Australia. The largest number of Greeks came from the regions of Central Greece,wrapper known as Macedonia, and Thrace. The regions of Greece that sent the least people to America were the Aegean Islands and Peloponnesian Islands. Significant Greek American communities can be found in metro Detroit. The most populated, made up of people of Greek descent living in Detroit, Dearborn, and parts of Macomb County, has a large concentration of Greek Americans. Thessaly, a village in Greece that was named after a region of Greece, has a large population of Greek American descendants in Troy, Michigan. The largest church in Thessaly, The Metropolitan Church in Troy, was founded by immigrants from Greece and is a registered historic building. The cultural presence of Greeks in America has been significant since the start of the 20th century. Many prominent American poets, such as Jimmy Santiago Baca, Gary Soto, and the late Gary Sampson, were born to Greek immigrant parents. Greek American and Detroit native Charles Boggs was a photographer, author, curator, and professor. Greek American Dr. Nikolaos Plastiras was a preeminent surgeon in the United States, while Greek American musician Mikis Theodorakis was one of the most significant composers of the 20th century. In addition to the large population of Greek descent in Troy, many Greek immigrants also settled in the city of Farmington, Michigan. Among Farmington's most famous residents were the poet John Mavrogianis and the Greek-American electrical engineer John Pappas. Other significant Greek American settlements in Michigan include Centerline, Center Line, Farmington, Livonia, Melvindale, Novi, Pleasant Ridge, Royal Oak, and Utica.",

    "The Pennine Way is a 252-mile (407 km) footpath from Edale in the Peak District to Lancashire Landscapes in the North East of England. The Way was first authorised in 1921 as a circular route around the Lake District. It was extended to Hell Corner near Framdale in the Lake District, and onwards through the Peak District to the South Derbyshire district of Bonsall, following existing packhorse trails. The route was again amended in 1935 to follow an alternative route around the Lake District avoiding the most difficult sections. This alternative route runs west from Edale, avoiding Chubilee Moss and going past High Hatherley Tarn to reach Westward Ho!, following the Old Durham Road to Bolton, following the Via Paolo Alto to Cromford, and then following the Hope Valley to Oakley. This route avoids the most difficult sections on the original route, but is steeper and longer. The route was again amended in 1962 to include the section between Cromford and Bolton following the Hope Valley. The route is rarely walked as a single track, but is typically done in two days, with a night stop in Lancaster or Sedbergh. It is regularly attempted as a multi-day route, with various sections left for longer or shorter routes. It is suitable for all abilities, and can be completed comfortably in either summer or winter. The route follows public paths and roads, with some sections of steep downhill crossing canals and rivers. The majority of the route is on high level paths and roads, with very few steep ascents or descents. The Way connects with several longer walks in the South Pennines and North Pennines directions, as well as other local footpaths. The route is administered by the Pennine Way Trust, a registered charity. The Trust was formed in 1973 to take on the management of the route from the National Park Authority, and to promote the route. The first route over the Peak District was marked with painted arrows on the road, but these were later removed after one said to have been stolen and repaired by treasure seekers. A cairn at Hell Corner, with a concrete arrow alongside, now marks the start of the circular route around the Lake District.",

    "Ajmer dargah bombing was a terrorist attack that occurred on 20th September, 2007, near the Ajmer dargah, in the city of Ajmer, Rajasthan state, India. Seven soldiers were killed and 15 others injured when a bomb was triggered by the Indian Mujahideen (IM) at a busy part of the city. The blast occurred near the Waheeda St intersection. According to the police, the bomb was made up of 15kg of explosives. This was one of the series of attacks planned by the Indian Mujahideen (IM) to target security forces in India. The Ajmer dargah is the tomb of Sufi Saint Ajmer Shah, who died in 1468. The dargah is visited by thousands of people daily. The bombing took place on Saturday, the last day of Ramadan. Ajmer has often seen significant Muslim population, which makes it a target of terror groups. The Indian government blamed the IM for the attack. The IM, aIslamic terror group active in India, claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack took place 2 years after the Indian Mujahideen was founded by Yasin Bhatkal. The Ajmer dargah bombing resulted in Ajmer getting the epithet of \"Little Pakistan\". In the next four days there was a surge in the number of security personnel in the city. The Ajmer dargah bombing was followed by a series of bomb blasts in the state of Rajasthan. The IM claimed responsibility for all of them. But all of them were proven to be fake. The Ajmer dargah was under 24x7 CCTV surveillance, and the videos showed the presence of several personnel without identification documents. In March 2008, the police arrested two Indians in Pakistan who were allegedly involved in the Ajmer dargah bombing. Both of them were from Ajmer. One of them, Shahid Junaid, was wanted by Indian authorities for several criminal cases and was allegedly responsible for several bombings in India, including the blast at the Varanasi flight in December 2007. There was wide spread suspicion that the Ajmer dargah bombing was a retaliation to the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's official visit to Ajmer. The IM has been targeting the government, and they viewed Singh as a representative of the Indian government. The Ajmer attack was therefore seen as a way of getting a message to the Indian government to stay away from their areas. However, the police did not find any evidence to connect the IM with the attack.",

Antarvedi is also famous for its temple to Maa Anita Ashram, which was established by Shiv Bhagat Singh (Shiv Dayal Singh) in 1934. Shiv Bhagat Singh, also known as Anita Shakti Peeth, was born on 17 August 1869 at Sitapur (now in Uttar Pradesh) into a Sikh family. He was the seventh and youngest son of Kunj Bhagat and Sakebi Devi. He was baptised in the local Chhaprauli dialect as \"Dayanand\". When he was six months old, he lost both his parents. His elder brothers were sent to an English school and he was handed over to Mani Bhagat, a paternal uncle. At the age of four, he lost his second mother at the age of seven when he was shifted to Sitapur. During this period, Shiv Bhagat Singh developed a strong belief in the worship of God, and later he named himself \"Shiv Dayal Singh\". At the age of 12, he was sent to Hardwar, where he took bath in the waters of River Ganga and became vegetarian. He had devotion to God and started spending a lot of time in the forest of Sitapur. He used to sing religious songs and composed couple of bhajans. He returned to Sitapur at the age of 18 and started working in a hosiery mill. He composed Ramcharit Manas and wrote a couple of articles in Sainik Samachar. A local lady named Kanau Rani was attracted to him and they married in 1892. They had three sons and a daughter. Shiv Dayal Singh took holy dip in a local water source called Man Sphat and established the temple in 1934. In 1917, when Shiv Dayal Singh was 24 years old, he and his brothers got into a quarrel with some British landlords and workers. Shiv Dayal Singh was jailed and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His two brothers took him out of prison in 1918 and they all left for Delhi with the help of some followers. Shiv Dayal Singh managed to escape from prison and went back to Sitapur. Shiv Dayal Singh worked as a tailor and composed several devotional songs like \"Ramanand Sara\", \"Geeta Granthkar\", and \"Naariyan\". After the assassination of Master Tara Singh, who was a disciple of Shiv Dayal Singh, he and his followers started demanding independence for India. On the eve of Indian independence, Shiv Dayal Singh along with Chandra Shekhar, the then prime minister of India, met with Jawaharlal Nehru, the then prime minister of India, at a dinner party. In 1945, he died of respiratory paralysis at the age of 55. Shiv Bhagat Singh, also known as Anita Shakti Peeth, was established at the age of 70. The present day temple was built in 1934 by Shiv Dayal Singh. A grand urn containing his hair is kept in the temple. There is a beautiful pond in the Antarvedi village. The Antarvedi Dam is also situated in this village. Antarvedi is surrounded by hills on three sides. There are many temples in Antarvedi, and one of them is the Shiv temple. The climate of Antarvedi is very hot in summers and cold in winters. There is an important government-run bus service from Antarvedi to the Faizabad city.

The roadway is simply labeled State Highway 7 on many maps. There is also a State Highway 71 in Oklahoma County in the Chicago metropolitan area. That route is a continuation of US-67, running from 127th Street west to Devon Avenue. It is operated by the Chicago Police Department and is not part of the state highway system. The western State Highway 71 was established on December 16, 1935 as a continuation of county roads from US-77 south of Vici to a point 5 miles south of Lehigh. The eastern segment was created on February 20, 1953 as a second segment of the parent route. The highway was extended north to US-177 in Wewoka on November 3, 1964, a northerly bypass of Akin was added on April 29, 1965, and the Wewoka bypass was transferred to SH-66 on February 28, 1967. The northernmost 5 miles of the highway was given a spur on February 20, 1973 connecting it to SH-66 near Lehigh. On July 1, 1989, the eastern segment was truncated to its current length, and a southern segment was created from US-77 to Vici. The eastern and southern segments were combined on November 3, 2004. The route totaled about 30 miles from 1935 to 1964 when it was extended to Wewoka. Two more miles were added in 1965 when the Akin bypass was completed. The route was extended 5 miles to Lehigh in 1967 and received a 5-mile long northern extension in 1973. The route was extended again to its current length of 30 miles in 1989 and 2004.",

As of 2006 the town had a population of 22,437. Chaesang was previously the site of a significant United States military installation known as Camp Holloway, which was closed in 1973. The base was significant enough to warrant a military security zone and a significant military presence in the town up until the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. Today, the area around Chaesang is mostly agricultural, but the town itself has retained some evidence of its past as a military encampment, including one bridge that spans the Ha Tay River.

A: It's a mercury switch. A mercury switch works by having a thin piece of mercury, which is essentially liquid metal, held in a sealed tube. The end of the tube is attached to a rock or some other fixed object. If enough gravity is applied to the tube, the mercury will flow to the end of the tube attached to the rock, completing a circuit and letting the rest of the mercury drown. <|endoftext|>Development of a simple metal-ion selective electrode based on the co-assembly of phospholipid and perylenebis(dicarboximide) for in vivo monitoring of brain metal-ion levels. A simple potentiometric sensor for in vivo monitoring of brain metal-ion levels, based on the co-assembly of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE), a neutral phospholipid, and perylenebis(dicarboximide) (PDI), a positive ionophore, was developed. A marked change in the potentiometric response to Ag+ ions was observed by varying the ratio of DPPE and PDI in the co-assembly. The optimized PDI/DPPE (2:1) salt was coated on a commercial Au electrode and was demonstrated for the first time for Ag+ ion selective detection with a detection limit of 6.5 nM. The developed Ag+ ion selective electrode (AgISE) was used for the in vivo monitoring of Ag+ levels in the brain of male wistar rats after subcutaneous (sc) administration of AgNPs. The Ag+ ion levels were elevated for 24 h and reduced to the basal level within 48 h after Ag+ injection. The results of the in vivo monitoring were found to be in agreement with in vitro dispersion experiments using UV-vis spectroscopy. The present work demonstrates the potential of phospholipid-based co-assemblies for the development of highly selective and sensitive in vivo brain metal-ion sensors.<|endoftext|>Patrick Landel Patrick Landel (born 4 June 1944) is a French alpine skier.

    "François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre (21 March 1613 – 9 March 1680) was a French writer. He is noted for his mordant wit and was the foremost French moralist of the Baroque era. His Complete Works were published in 12 volumes between 1878 and 1882; an unofficial 22nd volume, consisting of a Postscript, was added in 1922. Some of his most well-known maxims are: \"Let us avoid discussing serious subjects with serious people; for once they get started, they will never stop talking of serious things,\" and \"Good style requires that one avoid stating what can be left ambiguous and, on the contrary, express oneself with precision and clarity\". \"It is wise to follow the trail of the serpent in the grass; for, though it is broad and bright, no one sees it till we have trodden it. It is wise to perform one good deed every day; for, though a single good action is but a small spark, it may kindle in us a flame that shall illuminate our whole life.\" François de La Rochefoucauld was the third of four children of Francois de La Rochefoucauld, Seigneur de la Brède and Dame d'Angoulême, and of Marie de L'Enfant; he had three brothers and one sister. After studying at the Jesuit College of La Flèche, he went to Paris and, at the age of 17, joined the retinue of the constable of France, Armand de Mauprin, Duke of Burgundy. A lieutenant in the royal troops, he resigned his commission in 1642 to live a more ascetic lifestyle. He spent several years in Geneva, and later in Nevers. On his father's death in 1645, he inherited the family title, marquis de Montandre, and joined the parliament of Paris, where he voted against the execution of King Charles I of England. He published several essays on moral topics between 1648 and 1652, thus founding the genre of moral treatise. During the Fronde, the Prince of Conde, among others, urged him to write down his wise maxims. He complied, and became very rich, but his advice and example were forgotten. His work was rediscovered by Joseph-Alfred Munder (1820–1886), who published it in twelve volumes between 1878 and 1882, with the title, A Library of the Saints: Prayers, Meditations, Maxims, Fables, and Reflections of M. de La Rochefoucauld.

    "The Other Campaign (sometimes stylized as THE OTHER CAMPAIGN) was a professional wrestling feud between WWE Women's Champion Sasha Banks and Charlotte, the self-proclaimed \"Man of Honor\" for The Manconsciousness stable, over the affections of The Manhood, Storm Ali. The feud played out on the June and July television shows on the WWE Network. Wrestlers in the match often aligned themselves with one wrestler or the other in the feud, but would sometimes switch sides, indicating the internal politics of the relationships in The Manhood, Storm Ali. The feud played out between two high-profile female champions, both of whom are undefeated in singles competition, with Banks winning the inaugural Women's Championship (bankrupting The Manhood, Storm Ali's claim to the title) and Charlotte winning the subsequent tournament to determine the true leader of The Manhood, Storm Ali. The feud also featured both wrestlers landing finishers with Banks' Bank Statement and Charlotte's Coquina Clutch to go along with psychological warfare. While the story was being promoted, Banks and Charlotte would switch sides, with Banks betraying Charlotte and vice versa. Banks was originally positioned as being the good guy of the pairing, while Charlotte was positioned as being the evil villainess, with Banks' heel turn being framed as a \"manipulation\" by Charlotte. After the angle ended, Banks and Charlotte remained close in real life, with both being released from their contracts by WWE within the same month. The feud was critically well received, receiving praise for the promotion of women's wrestling and memorable wrestling matches between the two women, in particular the three quarter bridge window, Monsterâ¢s Mama, fire tornado modified versions of Bank Statement and Coquina Clutch. Despite the generally positive reception, the feud is often considered the worst in the history of WWE Women's Champion, with one source describing it as a \"trainwreck\" and another as \"painful to watch\". The feud was acknowledged on WWE's 20 Years of WrestleMania, with the commentators describing it as the beginning of the \"Women's Revolution\". In 2019, both Banks and Charlotte expressed interest in a reunion, with Charlotte being open to the idea of a Manhood Rebellion against Ali. At Money in the Bank, Charlotte and Ali lost to Storm and Ruby Riott in a mixed tag team match, setting up a rematch between the two rival factions at Elimination Chamber and June's Extreme Rules.

In subsequent years, Banks and Charlotte have continued to team up and attack their former rival, with Banks attacking Charlotte following a win in 2023 and then aligning herself with Ruby Riott and the Riott Squad the following month, again attacking Charlotte. In November 2023, The Manhood, Storm Ali, signed a contract with SmackDown! Tag Team Champions The Usos, starting a feud between the two groups. Prior to Manhood versus Usos, Charlotte had aligned herself with Storm in attacking Sasha Banks and Ruby Riott during a tag team match, seemingly starting the feud between the two factions. However, Ruby and Kicks only managed to save Sasha Banks from an attack by Charlotte and Storm. The next week on SmackDown, it was revealed that Charlotte had tricked both Storm and Ruby into attacking Kicks and Sasha Banks, while in reality she was going to perform the same attack on the entire SmackDown! roster, thus starting a cross-brand rivalry between the two factions. As SmackDown's General Manager, Charlotte had the power to determine who would remain alive and face her in a handicap match at No Mercy. Charlotte chose to have SmackDown! Women's Champion Carmella, RAW Women's Champion Kavs, SmackDown! Women's Champion Asuka and SmackDown! Women's Open Champion Naomi battle against Ruby, Sasha Banks, Kicks, and the current revival of Storm in a WarGames match, with the last two standing would face Charlotte the following week in a handicap match. On the following edition of SmackDown, Charlotte offered an open challenge for any of SmackDown's Women's Division to come claim what was rightfully hers - the SmackDown",

The type certification covers the airplane’s airframe and engines, and includes detailed procedures for conducting maintenance and operations on the Mk.1. Aeromakrightarrow signed a distribution agreement with Aurora Flight Sciences to sell the Mk.1 in North America, and the certification gives the company the security to start flying the jets to customers in real-life conditions. “This is a major milestone for Aeromakrightarrow and is a result of over two years of hard work from all of our employees,” co-founder and CEO Rune Aasa told pv magazine. “This type certification covers all aspects of our business, and it is a real game changer for the industry. We are now one step closer to delivering our vision of offering a modern, more efficient and safer light jet.” The Mk.1 is a re-engined variant of the Light Jet Aircraft (LJA) designed by The Aerowolf Company, the same company that designed the Cirrus Vision Jet. The Mk.1 has a maximum take-off weight of 7,500 kg (16,000 lbs) and a MTOW of 10,250 kg (22,000 lbs). The LJA can achieve a maximum flight time of up to 21 hours, while the Mk.1 will achieve that in 14 hours. The company is planning to deliver 15 Mk.1 jets to customers across the world by the end of 2023, with a further 30 jets sold to customers in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. The Mk.1 is being developed at a reasonable price of $27.5 million, and the company plans to market it at $38 million. The aircraft will be powered by two EuroPropSwed PW1164 engines, with a certification cost of $500,000. The certification of the Mk.1 comes more than three years after the first prototypes were built. The initial list price for the Mk.1 was $38 million, but the company is now offering it for $27.5 million, and plans to sell it for $38 million after it receives type certification. Aurora Flight Sciences has designed a whole family of two-engine light jets and the new certification makes Aeromakrightarrow the first European company to offer a low-cost, long-range, modern light jet. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received the type certification for the Mk.1 in August 2016, and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the company a development and production certificate in November 2016.

    "HMCS Margaret Brooke was a Canadian naval facility and a ship of the Royal Canadian Navy. The naval facility was located in the south part of Nova Scotia near the town of Port Regal and was operational between 1954 and 1999. The naval facility was used for a variety of tasks including training cadets and officers as well as housing members of the Canadian military. The HMCS Margaret Brooke was home to both former prime ministers Pierre Trudeau and Joe Clark as well as various other high-ranking military officials. In 1999 the naval facility was turned into a National Historic Site of Canada. HMCS Margaret Brooke was named after an Nova Scotian born daughter of the 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. The naming of the naval facility was a tribute to the naval facility and its role in Canadian military history. The HMCS Margaret Brooke was home to several famous people throughout its lifetime including Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, and Jack Pickersgill. Pierre Trudeau was the first Canadian prime minister to be based out of the HMCS Margaret Brooke during his tenure from 1963-64. Trudeau would later return to the naval facility in 1968 to serve as an elected Member of Parliament for Papineau until 1979. Joe Clark would also spend time stationed at the HMCS Margaret Brooke during his time in office from 1963-1968. Clark's tenure as prime minister is known for the \"Silver Dollar\" dispute with Canada's neighbor to the south, The United States. The dispute began with an American embargo on Canadian goods that lasted for a period of ten weeks. The naval facility was used to house the naval command responsible for patrolling the naval blockade. The dispute was eventually resolved and did not cause any hardships between the countries. Jack Pickersgill also spent some time at the HMCS Margaret Brooke. Pickersgill was the Canadian Minister of Defence during the whole of the naval facility's existence. He also served as the commander of the naval facility for many years. HMCS Margaret Brooke's operations finished in 1999 after its Naval Dockyard Aldershot was opened. The naval dockyard was capable of performing the same tasks as HMCS Margaret Brooke and was already operating by 1999. HMCS Margaret Brooke is today home to the historic site and a museum located on the site. The museum tells the story of the naval facility as well as the history of the Canadian military. A ferry will also link the HMCS Margaret Brooke to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia which is the oldest continually inhabited city in Canada.

    "Paris meridian or Paris Greenwich meridian is a meridian arc used for determining the Greenwich time in Paris, France. The Paris meridian is the local meridian in use in Paris, France, and some of its suburbs. This local meridian differs from the Greenwich meridian by one second of time, corresponding to one revolution of the Earth relative to the Sun (astronomy) or one International time zone (timing) shift. For this reason, Paris and the surrounding region of Île-de-France (region) are an exception within France, where the astronomical Greenwich meridian is used as the local meridian. Because of its particular location, Paris is a rare example of a city with two meridians. The Paris meridian was chosen as the local meridian for France in 1595 by King Henry IV. The process was repeated in 1667 by King Charles II. It then remained unchanged until 1889, when it was modified under the Paris Commune. It was again modified in 1971 at the International Date Line (AZL91) agreement. The Paris meridian is used in France since the French revolution in 1789. Its official name is \"meridian de la commune de Paris\", but it is more commonly known as the \"Greenwich parisien\" because it differs from the Greenwich meridian by one second of time. In popular culture, a reference to the Paris meridian is used to mark the present time. For example, when a character in a story is asked \"Quand est-il la?\" (When is it?), they can reply \"À quatorze Parises, merci!\" (\"At 14:30 it's Paris!\").",
    "The Calvin–Hope men's basketball rivalry is a basketball rivalry between the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Pennsylvania, sometimes referred to as the \"Trirumaa\" because of their shared location in Estonia, the \"Holy War\" because of the number of matches played between the two schools and the high stakes involved, or the \"East Coast/West Coast Showcase\" because of the high number of future NBA players that come from this rivalry. The two schools first played each other in 1904, with the UC Berkeley missing the playoffs the last ten meetings. The schools play every year with the games generally alternating between the two schools' home courts. Games played in Estonia are called \"tournament games\" and are considered official by both schools. The schools first met in the 1915–16 season with Penn winning the first game 70–55 before a large crowd in spite of protests from the large Cal student section, the smallest of any visiting team's arena. Due to the backdrop of the two schools being in the same country, playing in a nearby town considered by both schools as a home game, and the extremely competitive nature of the games, the two schools often develop rivalries with other local basketball teams such as Golden State Warriors star Zach LaVine who played college basketball at the University of Pennsylvania before being selected first overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2015 NBA draft. The most recent matchup between the two schools was on January 18, 2023 with the Penn Quakers winning 85–77.",

    "W.A.K.O. (World association for amateur boxing; formally World Amateur Boxing Organization) World Championships 2005 (Agadir) was a boxing tournament held in Agadir, Morocco on September 28 to October 3, 2005. A total of 284 boxers from 25 countries competed in the tournament, which was organised by the Royal Moroccan Wrestling and Boxing Federation. 20 light welterweight (63.5 kg) medals were awarded, making it the most successful European boxing tournament of all time. As of 2011, the W.A.K.O. World Championships are staged every two years with the even numbered years being candidates for championships and the odd numbered years being the following decade in which no championships are staged. Thus, 2005 was the year in which the decade of 2030 will be featured with championships. A total of 37 different countries were represented at the 2005 W.A.K.O. Championships. The 2023 W.A.K.O. Championships will be staged in Madrid, Spain. W.A.K.O. was founded in 1965 as World Federation of Public Football (WFPF). In 1971, the name was changed to World Federation of American Football (WFAF). In 1997, the name was changed to World Amateur Boxing Organization (W.A.K.O.). In 2001, the W.A.K.O. World Championships were granted the right to hold International Standard for boxers, which means the boxers compete in bare feet. This was the first such standard in the world of boxing and amateur wrestling. 2004 was the last year that the W.A.K.O. Championships were held in Atlantic City, US. The event was hosted by Morocco for the first time and was organized by the Royal Moroccan Wrestling and Boxing Federation. The decision was made to move the event every two years in even numbered years and the decade of 2030 in which no W.A.K.O. Championships are staged. The first move was 2005 which was held in Agadir, Morocco. The second move was 2009 which will take place in Moscow, Russia. The host country for the 2023 W.A.K.O. Championships has not been announced as of October 2012. Morocco has hosted the W.A.K.O. Championships in 2005, 2009 and 2023. Morocco has been the most frequent host of the tournament, holding it in the period between 2002 and 2012. The Royal Moroccan Wrestling and Boxing Federation was awarded the hosting right for 2023. The last edition was held in Atlantic City, US in 2004. Morocco was awarded the hosting right because it has the most developed boxing scene in the world and many W.A.K.O. tournament winners came from the country. The most successful participant was Mohamed Aboutabi from Morocco with 3 gold medals. The 2023 W.A.K.O. Championships will be staged in three weight categories: - 63.5 kg: light welterweight - 77 kg: middleweight - 91 kg: heavyweight. A total of 37 countries were represented at the 2005 W.A.K.O. Championships. The most frequent participation was from Morocco, USA, Germany, France, Spain and Egypt. The 2023 W.A.K.O. Championships will follow the even number years pattern, in which years candidates are staged and the odd numbered years are the following decade in which no W.A.K.O. Championships are staged. As of April 2023, Morocco has staged the W.A.K.O. Championships for 6 times, second most countries in this list is USA with 5 times staging of W.A.K.O. Championships. Morocco is the most frequent host of the W.A.K.O. Championships with seven staging of the event. The Royal Moroccan Wrestling and Boxing Federation organised the event in 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2023. The W.A.K.O. Championships are regarded as one of the most prestigious sporting events for boxers and wrestling and draw large crowds of spectators. The high standard of the tournament and top athletes makes it a great platform for a rising sport star to become well known. The success of the tournament is often measured by the number of medals won by the national teams. Morocco is the country that won the most medals at the W.A.K.O. Championships with 20 medals. Egypt and USA are the other countries that won more than 10 medals at the W.A.K.O. Championships. Wrestling is making its debut at the W.A.",

    "Norfloxacin, an antibiotic belonging to the quinolone class, was first developed in 1981 by the Japanese company Tobisha and is currently marketed under the trade name Copegus. It has been shown to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacterial infections, with particular activity against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pneumococci as well as a range of gram-positive bacteria. It is taken orally and has an bioavailability of around 55% which leads to a high bioavailability when administered intravenously. In animal studies, the intravenous dose was 30% lower when administered as norfloxacin compared to other quinolones such as ciprofloxacin. This difference in efficacy has yet to be proven in humans, although initial trials indicate that norfloxacin has similar efficacy to ciprofloxacin when treating infections such as gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections. It is not used to treat lower respiratory tract infections as it has inferior tissue concentration compared to other quinolones. Norfloxacin has a low potential for phototoxicity and ten times more concentrated in the skin compared to plasma. Because of its long elimination half-life of around 6 hours, norfloxacin is frequently used to treat bacterial infections in patients with renal impairment as it does not require any adjustment of its dosage according to the impaired renal function. In comparison to other quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin is a weaker inhibitor of the human cytoplasmic enzyme CYP3A4 and thus has a reduced risk of phototoxicity and can be co-administered with drugs such as verapamil and phenytoin without adverse effects. Norfloxacin was approved in the United States in 2002, in the European Union in 2003 and in other regions like Japan, South Korea and Canada shortly thereafter. It was the sixth quinolone to be marketed.",

    "Choanephora cucurbitarum, also known as the pumpkin maggot or squash worm, is an insect pest that can severely damage vine-trained cucurbits such as pumpkins and squash. It was first detected in New Jersey in 2015 and has been found in approximately 30 states since. It is primarily transmitted via a hemolymph-feeding habitus, and can also spread via infected plant material, improperly cleaned transplant tools, and vectors such as flies and sucking insects. C. cucurbitarum was originally identified in 1964 as Delia harmonialis, but was renamed after its relationship with Choanephora was discovered in 2003.

C. cucurbitarum was originally identified in 1964 as Delia harmonialis, but was renamed after its relationship with Choanephora was discovered in 2003. Although its complete life cycle has not been determined, C. cucurbitarum presumably overwinters as an egg and may have a colony developing in decaying plant material or in ground water. The first larvae appear in the spring, hatching from eggs after approximately two weeks. Larvae consume the leaves of their host plant, frequently winding up in galls caused by the poor development of their digestive systems. In these protected locations, they undergo four instars before spinning cocoons and overwintering. The next generation emerges in the late summer or early fall.

The $1.4B shortfall represents a 2.2% decrease over the current year’s budget. The proposed $1.4B shortfall is the result of a $14M deficit in unreserved funds (funds not intended for specific projects). “These budgeting realities reflect the tight fiscal climate we face, but they also reflect a prudence that has been absent for too long,” said Diana. “We have made reductions and changes, but there is still more we can do.” Budget priorities include: Funding basic services. Based on the recently passed 2018-19 Budget, Orange County will continue to fund basic services at existing levels. Funding investments. We will continue to make investments in key areas, including public safety, health and human services, and public facilities. Restoring reserves. As always, reserves remain a vital source of financial stability. We must restore these reserves to their 2022 level to meet our long-term financial obligations. “We will continue to consider innovative ideas to advance our strategic objectives while staying within our core budget. I look forward to working with the Legislature in the months ahead to close the gap,” said Diana. The proposed 2021 budget is the sixth consecutive year that Orange County has operated with a budget deficit. Since 2009, county spending has increased by an average of 17.7%, while revenues have increased by an average of 3.2%. “Despite years of budget deficits, we have made significant progress in stabilizing our finances and building a strong financial foundation for the future,” said Diana. “The proposed 2021 budget is the latest example of our willingness to make difficult choices, and we will continue to make progress as we work to balance our books.” The proposed 2021 budget can be found here. Subsequent to the adoption of the 2021 budget, Diana will hold a series of public workshops to present his full budget recommendations and to receive input on key budget decisions.

    "The Online News Association was founded in 1994 as a non-profit organization to provide a professional set of ethics and guidelines for journalists to help protect news consumers online. The ONA defines \"online news\" as \"newspapers, online journals, and news sites published on the Internet.\" The association has 63 member publications and a total staff of four. Its offices are located in Reston, VA. The current president of the Online News Association is Lou Ferrara who is also Chief Technology Officer at Verisign. The ONA has published a set of ethical guidelines for online journalists which include not using false personal identity, not publishing physical or financial addresses of individuals unless they have done something unlawful, not publishing passwords or other means to access material that is not already in the public domain, and not sending news articles before they have been checked for accuracy and completeness.

    "The Miarolitic cavity was the first of a series of tests of a weak form of the primaeval atom hypothesis. The hypothesis, proposed by Czech scientist Jan Wallauer, states that early in the universe's history all matter was closely connected and formed a single, huge, super-heavy atom, a galactic nucleus. As time passed, this atomic nucleus split into smaller nuclei, which in turn fused to form the present day atoms of matter. The Miarolitic cavity was the first test of the hypothesis that all these nuclei might one day form a single, huge, super-heavy atom again, a possibility that became known as the Primordial atom. The Miarolitic cavity is also known as \"Wallauer's dish\". It was a tiny cavity of less than a litre in volume, manufactured from a tiny slab of platinum-iridium alloy 20 microns (0.2mm) thick by a combining ion beam technique. It was manufactured at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences' (now the Czech Academy of Sciences) in Piešťany in the Czech Republic and weight approximately 30 grams. The hypothesis stated that nuclei might one day form a single, huge, super-heavy atom again, and that the Miarolitic cavity, if it could be found to contain any nuclei at all, would contain only one nucleus. The Miarolitic cavity was successfully heated up to a very high temperature in a test of the heating method on 12 June 1961. However, it remained empty.",
    "The Brattain–Hadley House is a historic house in Canfield, Ohio, United States, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was constructed in 1880 and was home to Emanuel Bratton, an American inventor, along with his family until 1906. In 1906, John and Phoebe Haynes bought the house, and in 1925, they hired local architect Fred Miller to modify the house for use as his residence. The Brattain–Hadley House is important to both Ohio history and automobile history. Emanuel Bratton, an American inventor, lived here with his family from 1880 until 1906. He is best known for his work with electromagnets and rear-wheel drive, which he discovered would work better on a three-wheel car. His work with three-wheel cars eventually led to the formation of the Ford Motor Company. In 1906, John and Phoebe Haynes bought the house and hired local architect Fred Miller to modify the house for use as his residence. Miller is known for his residential work in the era known as the American Crafts Movement. The house has since been remodeled a number of times, most recently in the 1990s.

    "Cerenzia is a small, Mediterranean island situated some 60km south of Greece. It is approximately 30km west to east and has a land area of just over 2 square kilometers. Cerenzia is primarily inhabited, with nearly half of the population, who number around 4,000, living in the village of Agios Theodoros. The island is well known for it's unspoiled natural beauty and it's many registered historic monuments, with many structures dating back to the Byzantine and Venetian eras. Among the most notable of these are the 15th century Episcopal Palace, the 15th century Fortress of Parga, and the Venetian Bridge. The village of Agios Theodoros is situated near the southern tip of the island and overlooks the medieval port of Kamara. Cerenzia is roughly halfway between Venice and Athens and is roughly 10km from Syros, Schin travelerous and paradisiacal island. Memorable events involving Cerenzia include when it was used as a holding prison for French and American POWs during the Second World War, and when Israeli commandos from the Merkava battle tank carried out a successful operation to destroy a terrorist cell on the island in 2002. standout features of Cerenzia include its Byzantine architecture, unspoiled natural beauty and it's proximity to Syros and Schin Travelerous and paradisiacal island. Cerenzia is an island with a rich history and tourist potential. Due to its proximity to the popular holiday islands of Syros and Schin, it is well known to many visitors who come to Cerenzia for its beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters and many historical monuments. Despite the beauty of the island, many of the structures dating back to the Byzantine and Venetian eras are in need of maintenance and restoration. These include the 15th century Episcopal Palace, the 15th century Fortress of Parga, and the Venetian Bridge. By establishing a stable government, improving the island's infrastructure and investing in its tourist infrastructure, Cerenzia has the potential to develop a stable economy, becoming a self sufficient entity. Due to its close proximity to Syros, the island is an important fishing ground for the local population, who produce a variety of sea fish and molluscs. These include sea urchins, limpets, scallops, crayfish and monk fish. The sea fish are caught using a variety of methods, including trolling, bottom fishing and beach seining, and are then dried on-shore. Although the local population of the island are mainly fishing families, there is scope to establish a tourist based fishing industry, which would further benefit from the small harbour in Agios Theodoros and the close proximity of Syros. Cerenzia is the ideal location for those seeking a unique travel experience. The island has a very low population, leaving the majority of the island for the visitor to explore. Furthermore, the island's small size and close proximity to Syros mean that visitors can enjoy the beauty of the island's natural beauty without the need for a vehicle. On-site facilities include the 15th century Episcopal Palace and a small church, which serve as the island's main settlement, as well as a small harbour in Agios Theodoros. The nearby island of Syros, provides further facilities for guests of the island including taverns, restaurants, supermarkets and a small cinema. The Island also offers a unique opportunity to experience a traditional, local Cypriot meal, while enjoying the stunning views over the island's harbour and the Aegean Sea.",

    "Moonhole is an(other) nickname for the circular tunnel complex on the south pole of the Moon, named Cratereus. The name is derived from the Greek for moon crater. The complex is approximately 50 meters in diameter and was officially discovered by the China Chang'e 4 mission in December 2019. Moonhole is one of four small impact craters on the far side of the Moon, the others being Shackleton, Fermi and Frankland. Adjacent to the Moonhole is a small crater formation named Smallpv which is approximately 110 meters in diameter. Moonhole was the destination for the spacecraft Beresheet during its failed landing attempt in April 2022. Etymology and origins of the name The Moonhole complex was officially discovered on December 8, 2019, by the Chang'e 4 probe. It was dubbed by the Chinese press and space enthusiasts as Moonhole, after the Chinese name for the complex, Cratereus. The name is derived from the Greek for moon crater. Artwork of Moonhole A high-resolution image of Moonhole and Smallpv, taken by the Chang'e 4 probe on December 8, 2019, was publicly released on January 10, 2020. The image shows the Moonhole complex, with the central crater roughly 50 meters across and a smaller crater to the southeast, designated Smallpv. The surface around the craters appears relatively flat and clean, with few visible blemishes. Visiting Moonhole Moonhole, along with other areas of the far side of the Moon, cannot be visited by crewed missions.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain, playing critical roles in modulating neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. The subunit composition and arrangement of GABA-A receptors determines their unique functional properties. In the hippocampus, a major subregion of the brain that contributes to learning and memory, most GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are mediated by receptors composed of α1, α2, β and γ subunits. These receptors can form a spectrum of distinct pharmacologically and biochemically distinct receptors ranging from GABA-A receptor Cl- channels to highly specialized GABA-A receptors that are depolarizing and contribute to the post-tetanic potentiation of transmitter release. Recent studies suggest that the α1 subunit is able to assemble with various β and γ subunits to form unique receptors with altered biochemical and electrophysiological properties. These changes have been shown to affect the peak amplitude and decay kinetics of GABA-A IPSCs in hippocampus. Additionally, specific arrangements of subunit assemblies such as α1β and α5βγ can form GABA-A receptors that can generate spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, providing additional mechanisms for regulating GABA-A IPSC kinetics. Increasing evidence indicates that subunit composition and precise receptor arrangement are important factors modulating the function of GABA-A receptors.<|endoftext|>Q: How to retrieve DOM elements created dynamically with JavaScript My HTML file is something like: <html> <head> </head> <body> <div id=\"div1\"> <button type=\"button\">div1 button</button> </div> <div id=\"div2\"> <button type=\"button\">div2 button",
    "Ludic interface is a term used in contemporary digital culture to describe the ways in which computer software interfaces reflect and induce playful, abstract, and imaginative modes of thought, feeling, and experience. Ludic designs challenge the conventional interfaces by simplifying the complex, showing the unfamiliar in digestible yet complex ways, and encouraging users to play with and animate their experiences. For instance, Quirky is a popular website for sharing and discovering \"ludic\" designs. The idea for the website was born when Ben Trovati met Spencer Levin at an O'Reilly event and the two started to discuss how to break into the consumer product space. The website initially focused on \"quirky\" ideas that people were willing to pay money for. A \"quirky\" product is one that is novel, but not necessarily useful or practical. The \"ludic\" in \"ludic interface\" comes from Spencer's background in game design. While Ludic thinking is good for fostering imaginative thinking, it comes with certain caveats. Ludic designs make extensive use of graphics, animation, and \"game-like\" mechanics which can be difficult to operate, especially for the elderly or people who do not enjoy such stimulation. Ludic thinking is also antithetical to critical thinking and the wisdom that can only be attained through thoughtful consideration. Imaginative thinking is exciting, but it can lead to unsupported beliefs and shallow analysis. While Ludic designs make it easy to produce imaginative results, they require users to accept and engage in simple, sometimes child-like thinking. These considerations and others have led many to question the value of Ludic thinking and whether it should be fostered or discourage. While there is no singular approach to producing Ludic interfaces, there are key principles which can inform and improve the overall experience. Primary amongst these is simplicity. Avoid complex interfaces and features which might discourage users from playing with the product. One should also provide guidance and instructions on how to complete tasks which might otherwise appear mysterious or complex. User paradigms should also be considered. If a product caters to a younger demographic, it should appeal to their tastes and values. Similarly, if a product is intended for an older demographic, they should be presented with user controls and interfaces that are intuitive to them. Overall, Ludic interface is a challenging, but potentially powerful tool for fostering imaginative, but also critically thinking, minds. While it requires a certain state of mind, it can also provide a space to depart from rational thinking and allow for more creative and child-like modes of thinking to take root. While Ludic interface was popularized in the 2000s and 2010s, there is evidence that similar notions have been present throughout the history of human thought. The ancient Greek Philosopher Plato, for example, described a method of using color palettes to guide humans into non-rational modes of thinking. Many of Plato's ideas about the influence of color on cognition were not proven until the 20th century. Similarly, research into emotionally engaging design is another branch of design research which traces its origins back to the 20th century. Overall, Ludic interface is a challenging, but potentially powerful tool for fostering imaginative, but also critical thinking, minds. While it requires a certain state of mind, it can also provide a space to depart from rational thinking and allow for more creative and child-like modes of thinking to take root. This website contains a large body of work on the subject. The following are a few articles that briefly describe some of the principles in the field: 1. \"Access All Areas\" by Ben Trovati ( https://www.quirky.com/blog/tag/access-all-areas/ ) 2. \"Chroma Key (Visual Effects)\" ( https://www.quirky.com/blog/tag/chroma-key/ ) 3. \"Dolly\" by Spencer Levin ( https://www.quirky.com/blog/dolly/ ) 4. \"Five-Toolset\" by Rob Glowinsky ( https://www.quirky.com/blog/the-five-toolset/ ) A more detailed, yet still accessible introduction is available in \"Ludic Interface: New Thinking for New Technologies\" by Spencer Levin and Rob Glowinsky. The book describes Ludic thinking as a reaction to postmodernism and how technologies like the World Wide Web lead to a proliferation of information but diminution of focus and contemplation. The book covers design philosophies, historical examples, and detailed case studies in the chapters \"Case Study: McLuhan, the Net, and the Global Village\" and \"Case Study: Conceptual Modeling, Ludic Thinking, and Google's Creative",

    "Incarnate (film) is a 2009 American fantasy horror film inspired by the folklore of West Virginia and written and directed by Mike Mekis. The film premiered at the 2009 WoodsEdge Films Community Cinema Film Festival, won several awards and was released on DVD on October 7, 2009. The film stars Alexander Calvert, Colleen Cross, Corey Feldman, and Brittany Robertson and was shot on location in Mekis' home state. Plot In rural West Virginia in the 1920s, a witch named Momoaqualand commands a trio of slaves who have been imprisoned in the bodies of a human child, a dog and a crow. The witch uses her powers to commit a series of robberies to fund a spell that will allow her to regain her human form. After performing the last of the necessary rituals, Momoaqualand is reborn in human form and awakens in the body of 6-year-old Jennifer Darrow, the adopted daughter of Fuzzy, a local farmer. Fuzzy is charged with Momoaqualand's care until a new custodian can be located and, after initially refusing, Jennifer's aunt Granny joins them in the house to help out. Jennifer displays numerous supernatural abilities, including the power to transform into an animal of her choosing, and is quickly joined by two other local children — Alvin, an autistic savant, and Tara, a runaway — who have also been targeted by Momoaqualand's crimes. A series of escalating incidents reveals that Jennifer has been magically bound to the witch and is at risk of becoming her slave. The four of them, along with Granny and Fuzzy's friend Milton, form an uneasy alliance to defeat Momoaqualand and free Jennifer from her thrall. Cast Production The film was shot on location in Mekis' home state, in and around Charleston and the surrounding areas. Reception Danny Justice of Dread Central awarded the film four stars out of five, calling it a \"huge-scare fun fest that is unlike any other.\" Mark Kermode of BBC Culture called the film \"a weird, wild, nasty little treasure,\" and praised its score and visual style, while criticizing its length and script.

    "XHZT-FM is a radio station in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico that has been on the air since 1948. The station broadcasts on 98.5 MHz with a power of 250 watts. The station is owned by the government of Baja California and is known as \"Radio Baja California\". XHZT-FM can be received clearly in the U.S. border town of San Diego, California. The station has a local morning show, \"Despierta Baja California\", that is received by many in the U.S. on two non-commercial FM radio stations in San Diego County, KFAQ and KPWK. XHZT was one of the first radio stations in the world to offer a border radio format. The station frequently plays Mexican rock, regional Mexican, and English-language hits. XHZT is a common source of information for people in the U.S. about events in Mexico, and regularly reports about incidents at the border. The station provides a Mexican perspective on current local, national, and international topics. In addition to an FM signal, XHZT can be received on the internet via XHDHD.com and o Descubre, and via its Facebook page. From the beginning, XHZT played Manny Albarello's \"formula one\" music, with a few variations (the theme music was slightly modified), and this has been the case for decades. In 2020, the station's owner, the state of Baja California, launched a new website for the station, xhzt.com, as part of a new social media strategy. The website includes a \"ask the expert\" section, a virtual store, and a donation link. As of 2022, XHZT was broadcasting from a new facility with better sound and visibility, and its transmitter power was increased to 500 watts. Since the 90s, XHZT has been simulcasting on 92.3FM in San Ysidro, California, which increases the station's listenership in the San Diego metropolitan area. Many Mexican-American community organizations in San Diego have worked with XHZT to provide community information and keep the community informed. The XHZT callsign is also used for a television station in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. In January 2023, XHZT-FM requested that its call sign be transferred to that TV station, which had been silent for many years. On February 2023, XHZT-FM returned to the air in Tijuana, broadcasting the same formula one music that it had been broadcasting for decades. The formula one music can now be heard on the internet via XHZT-FM's new website, and also on radio stations in Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Chihuahua. In 2023, the station received approval from the IFT to increase its transmitter power to 1000 watts, and to modify its city of license to Tijuana. Although the formula one format has continued to the present, many expected that the format would change after XHZT's longtime General Manager, Manny Albarello, unexpectedly died in February 2022. Albarello was very passionate about the radio station and its history, and always wanted to share his knowledge with the community. Albarello, who was born in the U.S., was known as the \"Cesar Chavez of Baja California\" because he worked for many years to promote peace and understanding between the U.S. and Mexico. Albarello helped create community, family and professional organizations devoted to sports, culture, music, social assistance, and fighting drug trafficking. Many of these organizations still use XHZT-FM as their main communications channel. Albarello has received numerous honors for his community leadership, including the La Raza Humanitarian Award and the Golden Pen of Freedom. XHZT-FM has always played \"hispanic music\", regardless of the popularity of that genre at the time. The station's playlists have always been an important part of the station's format. Many of Albarello's relatives still work at the station, which is now under the leadership of Enrique Morones, who was previously the General Manager. XHZT is the oldest radio station in Baja California that still broadcasts the same format, and it continues to inform the Mexican community in the U.S. about news and events in Mexico. XHZT is also a very popular radio station that plays formula one, regional Mexican, and English-language hits.",

    "The space of directions is a topological space consisting of cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) and 0-degree angular directions (0 degrees North, 0 degrees East, 0 degrees South, 0 degrees West). It is often used in computer vision and machine learning to describe image datasets. The space of directions is a 4-dimensional manifold with an inner-product structure. It can be defined as a hyperplane in a infinite-dimensional vector space, where the vector space is a completion of the set of Dirac delta functions with respect to the inner product: Each point in the space of directions corresponds to a unit direction vector. The inner product of two direction vectors is the angle between them, and the perpendicular space to the space of directions in the vector space is the positive cone. The space of directions has several properties that make it well-suited for modeling images. First, it is symmetric, which means that in some contexts, applying a transformation to one point in the space of directions determines the transformation for all points in the space of directions. Second, it has an exponential relationship between the distance between two direction vectors and the angle between them, which means that infinitesimally close direction vectors represent surfaces in the space of directions that get increasingly parallel and orthogonal. Lastly, it's also separable, which means that each direction vector can be assigned to one of multiple sets which each form their own space of directions. These separate directions can then be combined to represent scenes with many objects, each with a small number of directions. An example space of directions is shown below, with the black points corresponding to directions in which all pixels are 0, and the white points corresponding to directions in which at least one pixel is 1. <br><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Spacedirection.svg/2000px-Spacedirection.svg.png\">",

The ensemble cast includes Don Johnson, James Earl Jones, Ralph Richardson, Madge Hill, Roberthung, Roddy McDowall, and Chuck Bannon.

In 1962, MLB team the Los Angeles Dodgers hired Chili Davis and Tom Alston, two black players, as the first black players ever signed by the team. The team was initially welcoming of the two new players, with many white fans and local politicians welcoming the additions and supporting the team on their way to winning the 1962 National League pennant and the World Series. However, as the 1962 season progressed, the two new players were often the target of racist harassment and violence, with their bus attacked, their homes firebombed, and their children receiving death threats. By the end of the season, one of the players had been forced to leave the team due to the level of hate crime, and the other was traded. The Defiant Ones dramatizes the true story with an ensemble cast, including Don Johnson as Chili Davis, James Earl Jones as Walter \"Wah Wah\" White, Madge Hill as Tommy Alston, Roberthung as Dick Radatz, Roddy McDowall as Coach Sid Gordon and Chuck Bannon as Mike Marshall.",

    "Khan Tengri is a Mount Imeon in the Khumbu Valley of the Himalayas, located on the Nepalese border with China. Situated at an altitude of (), it is the highest peak in the Kangchenjunga Himalayan range and the eighth-highest peak in the world. It is the highest peak in the Khan Tengri Range, which also contains the highest non-float peaks in five other major Himalayan ranges. Khan Tengri was first climbed on 26 July 1955 by Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Ang Dorjee Sherpa. It was the first of six 8,000-meter peaks climbed by Hillary. Khan Tengri, along with Mount Everest, K2, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse and Aktau, was the goal of Hillary's autobiography The Loss of loved ones often makes us the closest to God, because death reveals to us the true nature of things. Although Hillary and other climbers who first reached the summit of Khan Tengri regarded it as a more difficult summit to reach and more worthy of protection than nearby Mount Everest, it was not considered a particularly challenging climb by contemporary standards. It did not involve extreme altitude sickness, particularly because the Hillary expedition had airdropped oxygen to the climbing team at a high altitude of 26,260 feet ( 8000 m), roughly 8,000 feet (2,400 m) higher than any previous expedition. This was possible because of the recent invention of the liquid oxygen oxygen tank and the practice of a vertical takeoff. Two years later, in 1957, Hillary and Ed Aguirre became the first people to reach the summit by a new route, the South Col route. The route established had more technical difficulty and challenges than the 1955 route. Khan Tengri is part of the region known as the \"Third Pole\", given that the area is home to more than 10 million people. In 1981 the region was made a self-governing administrative division of the People's Republic of China, called Sinkiang. The ethnic group native to the region are known as the Nansis.

She was born in Norwich and died in London. Her parents were Walter Stephenson, a gravestone cutter, and his wife Elizabeth (née Harrison). She had an older brother and a younger sister. Stephenson was raised in Norwich and became a tearopper at 14. She married amateur dramatics promoter John Spence, with whom she had two children; they later divorced. In 1937, aged 18, she joined the Theatre Workshop, where she worked until 1939. During World War II, Stephenson worked as a WRNS officer interpreter. After the war, she worked as a freelance writer, writing radio plays and contributing to several British film magazines. She married director Michael Powell in 1948; they had one child. Her first big screenplay was for Powell's groundbreaking film noir 49 Steps (1935). She was an assistant to Powell and Robert Woodruff on tear-jerker Clara's Esimes (1946) and the film noir Up at the Villa (1953). She also worked as a script editor, first on Powell's adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma (1952) and then for his costume drama Black Narcissus (1954). She was nominated for two BAFTA Awards and three British Academy Film Awards and won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay for Powell's debut film, Key Card (1954).

    "Pseudothurmannia is a controversial genus of the fungi family Schizophyllaceae, with sexual morph Nigrospora and anamorphic (asexual) morph Pseudothurmanniella. It was described by Petr Brundgt in 1987 with the type species Pseudothurmannia hypericinium. The generic name honors mycologist Walther Johannes Crotzides, who created the family Pseudothurmanniaceae in 1958 to contain the type species of Pseudothurmannia, P. kanzleri. Pseudothurmannia has been characterised as a genus of uncertain placement, with its species formerly classified in genera such as Chaetomella, Chaetomidium and Chaetothyriophora. An increasing number of molecular studies place Pseudothurmannia in a distinct family Pseudothurmanniaceae, along with the genera Nigrospora and Nigrosporum. The genera Chaetomella, Chaetomidium and Chaetothyriophora are classified in the family Chaetomiaceae. The type species, Pseudothurmannia hypericinium, grows on decomposing wood, and has more pigments than most species of Nigrospora or Nigrosporum. The conidiophores are composed of metula, metulae and phialides, and the phialides have collarettes. Nigrospora and Nigrosporum have metula and metulae, and Chaetomiaceae has metula only. There is genetic and morphological evidence supporting the placement of Pseudothurmannia in a separate family. Chaetomiaceae has 17 to 19-celled conidia with cicatrices, while Nigrospora and Nigrosporum have 14 to 15-celled conidia without cicatrices. The two alternatives to placing Pseudothurmannia in a new family are to either synonymize it with Chaetomella, Chaetomidium and Chaetothyriophora or create a new family for it. The generic name Pseudothurmannia has been conserved over the other choices.

President Donald Trump declared late Wednesday that he wouldn’t blame Democrats if a partial government shutdown continued into next year, but he again blamed Democrats for the impasse and the resulting funding lapse — even as Republicans sided with him in blaming the other party for the gridlock. The president also said that he was “prepared” to keep the government closed “for a long time” if needed to secure funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and other key players in the GOP leadership on a possible deal. He also met with several conservative GOP senators on the Senate floor in a bid to rally the party around his proposal. “We're having a meeting now with the Republicans and we're gonna have a vote,” Trump told reporters as he left the meeting on the Senate floor. But Trump again faulted House Democrats for failing to act on a budget that includes the $5.7 billion he’s seeking for a wall at the southern border. And he once again threatened to keep the government shuttered “for a long time” if he doesn’t get the funding he needs. “We're having a meeting now with the Republicans and we're gonna have a vote,” Trump said. “We need the Democrats to come together and compromise. That's the only way we're going to stop these horrible crimes from happening — is by having a wall, by stopping drugs from coming in.” But Senate Republicans largely sided with McConnell, who said on the Senate floor that “only the Democrat majority in the House has prevented us from passing a budget with",
    "Illinois Route 133 (IL 133) is a state route in southern Illinois, United States, that parallels a stretch of Interstate 55. The southern terminus of the route is at Illinois Route 40 near Charleston; the northern terminus is at the Indiana state line near Machens. The roadway that is now IL 133 was originally established as a county road in Randolph County in 1908; the current configuration of the route was established in 1937. The route has had only minor realignments since then. The road is located in rural areas with an agriculture-related theme. Through 2020, Illinois had considered changing the route's number to honor President Ronald Reagan. The route had originally been designated as U.S. Route 66 in 1925; Reagan was known for his support of preserving the Route 66 landmarks. The Illinois Department of Transportation announced in 2013 that it would preserve the history of the highway but replace the number with a slogan. \"There it is—the Main Street of Route 66\" was chosen as the central theme for the new highway designation, and reflective median dividers were painted into the road.

    "Johnny Hopp (February 6, 1911 – November 22, 1998) was an American baseball right-handed pitcher who played in Major League Baseball from 1935 through 1954 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and Brooklyn Dodgers. Hopp was born in Kansas City, Missouri and attended the University of Missouri before he was signed by the Phillies. In 1935 Hopp had one of the most remarkable rookie seasons in baseball history. Playing in 28 games, Hopp went 15-7 with a 2.34 earned run average. His 15 wins were a Phillies team record that stood until 1959, and his overall ERA was second best in the National League (N L) only to 1938 New York Giants pitchers Christy Mathewson and Carl Hubbell. In 1936 Hopp started 27 games, finishing with a 12-8 record and a 2.55 ERA. His 12 victories were a team high and second best in the N L. Hopp was almost completely blocked by white All-Stars Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Roberto Clemente in the 1940s. But in 1945 Hopp led the N L in complete games (38) and innings pitched (247.0) and finished third in the league in wins (16) and strike out (184). The 1945 Phillies won the National League Pennant but lost the World Series to the cross-town rivals, the Cincinnati Reds. Hopp played his final game at the age of 46 in 1953.

    "The Holiday Report is an annual subscription-based report produced by the American television network NBC News. It debuted during the 2015 calendar year and is presented in a video format. It covers notable events that occurred during the last calendar year, 2020, and the first few months of 2021. As its name suggests, the report is meant to serve as a \"holiday\" for the audience, providing a quick glimpse of notable events and deaths that occurred during the last year and a few words about each. The format of the report borrows from that of news retrospectives, such as those published by NBC in the late 1980s and 1990s during the decade-long Cold War with the Soviet Union. The first Holiday Report, covering the year 2020, featured events such as the breakout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the United States Presidential election. The format was altered the following year, covering the year 2021, to present both positive and negative events in a bid to provide a more upbeat report in the wake of the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus and subsequent recession. As of 2023, a total of nine Holiday Reports have been published, the most of any year. The 2020 edition was the most-watched of the series to date, with more than four million viewers across three different platforms (NBC News online, NBC Nightly News, and the NBC News app). The Holiday Report has occasionally inspired parodies on the internet, especially on Twitter, where #Holiday hashtag has been widely used to poke fun at various trends that surfaced in the report.",
    "Ohms is an alias for Jon Cohen, a American singer-songwriter and record producer. Cohen began his career in the early 1990s as a member of rock band Blue Sky Black Death. After going by the name Ohms and producing several instrumental hip hop albums under the moniker Asciic返ASCII, Cohen decided to change his musical style and started utilizing vocals. In 2001, he released his debut album under the name Ohms. The album was a critical and commercial success, and became a staple in the downtempo scene. Ohms' second album, Out of the Past, was released in 2003. It featured collaborations with notable artists such as David Burden, Tino Corpus, and Alistair Marsh. The album was again well received by the critics, although the music industry saw little success for it, leading Cohen to pursue a career in film scoring. In 2014, Cohen returned to his hip hop roots and released the Ohms 2 album. The album featured rappers such as Kool AD, Crooked Law, and Chala. Despite critical acclaim, the album did not receive the same commercial success as the first two albums. Ohms went through several lineup changes through the years. After briefly collaborating with Elucid in 2017, Cohen returned in 2019 with the release of Mycelium. The album featured collaborations with Elucid as well as American rapper k.one and electronic artist Tim Green.

    "The Mother/Child Papers was a game invented by Gary Grigsby, Mike Kennedy, and Jason DeRose, which involved secretly observing one's parents interact, with the intent to disclose the information to one's children in later years. It was originally conceptualized while the developers were students at Rochester Institute of Technology. The game was the subject of an episode of Podtoid Convictions, a podcast by comedy writer Jacob Grumetti. The game includes four components: a secret box, observation slips, a codebook, and a decoder ring. The secret box contains a book describing the history of the game, observation slips written by the player's parents during their play, a codebook with clues for decoding the slips, and a decoder ring used to reveal details of the game to the player. The game was typically played at Christmas or on special occasions during a child's life. The player was typically an adult by the time the game was played, and typically had two children. The rules of the game often changed throughout the life of the player, with new layers of complexity being added as the player grew older. The observation slips were written in code, with words or phrases written in brackets hinting to the parent to leave more explicit clues in the text. Parents were instructed to only decode the slip once they had informed their children of its meaning. For example, the phrase \"Build a snowman\" might be written in the codebook with the instruction \"Insert the following sentences when your child asks why you are writing in a secret code: [Because I'm writing a book about The Mother/Child Papers]\". The game was always recommended to be played with children that were older than seven years old, and the parent was encouraged to only tell a small amount of lies to the child. The game was often described as providing a \"safe\" way for parents to discuss taboo subjects with their children, in an environment where the child could not ask questions and the parent could not tell the whole truth. However, several adults confessed to the game stated that they did not feel comfortable with the game's recommended age limit, and proceeded to secretly record their parents while they were not aware of it. Grigsby, Kennedy, and DeRose became aware of public interest in the game after their Podtoid Convictions episode received over a million views on YouTube and 500,000 views on the AltWeb.org video platform. They decided to release the game publicly after a suggestion from Patty McCord, who went on to work for CNN, with the goal to raise awareness of the game's importance as a tool for child observation and discussion. The game has been met with praise for its simulation of the taboo topics that real-life parents try to avoid, the realism of the observed actions, and the creativity of the story telling techniques that had to be used in order to explain the slips. Many journalists and parent advocates alike believe that the game should become a standard part of parent playbook materials, to be used with any child at any age.",

It was officially incorporated as a town in 1955. It takes its name from its close proximity to Signal Hill, a steep-sided headland overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. In 2017, Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi was briefly thrust into world news headlines due to Newfoundland's new provincial government, who introduced a bill to rename the town's airport, \"Joe Hogan Field\", in honour of the late Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal MP and former Deputy Premier. The bill passed the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly but was struck down by the Newfoundland and Labrador Senate. Avenue u-turns are banned in the town. Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi is well known as a popular summer destination for residents of St. John's, the capital of Newfoundland, and around the Avalon Peninsula, due to its relatively central location and temperate climate. The area has several small lakes ideal for swimming, fishing and general recreation. The community centre is located on Victoria Avenue, close to the centre of the town. The Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi Tourist Association maintains a website with detailed information on activities and attractions in the area, as well as a listing of local accommodation providers. The community of Quidi Vidi, located across the Trout River to the south, is home to Signal Hill Farmer's Market, a popular weekly event held on Saturday mornings throughout the summer. In addition to tourism, the local economy also benefits from the presence of the federal government's Mad Cat zinc mine, located approximately 20 km to the southwest, and linked to the town by an annual event, Signal Hill Festival, which includes a parade and a community bonfire.",

    "55 Cancri is a star system approximately 62 light years from the Earth in the southern constellation of Cancer. It has a mean solar analog is around 65 light years from the Earth. The name 55 Cancri comes from the Arabic phrase \"al-Burhān al-Sharīf\" meaning the chief lady in the breast. The planet 55 Cancri b is the only known planet to date in the system. The planet is 2.4 times the size of Earth and has an equilibrium temperature of 1450 K, which is hotter than both Venus and Mars. The planet is so hot because it is scorched by its parent star, 55 Cancri A, which has 4.2 times the mass of the Sun and has lived a longer lifespan of 12.3 billion years. The star is named 55 Cancri A. 55 Cancri A is relatively quiet, but its planet 55 Cancri b is being bombarded by rocks from its host star. Due to its proximity to the Earth, 55 Cancri system was one of the first star systems where an Earth-like planet was confirmed to be capable of supporting life. 55 Cancri system is also notable as the first system where the masses of the components were measured in a process known as astrometry.

    "Dear Myself You have been sitting on this bench for hours now, scrolling through Facebook, trying to ignore the pain in your legs from all the sitting. The wind is gently blowing through your brown hair, matching the slightly darker brown of the bench you are sitting on. You have realized that you have been in a very deep comparison loop for the last 5 hours, something has been constantly distracting you, and you can't seem to get it out of your head. You start thinking about how you dress, how you compare to how other people dress, how that must be so much easier, how everyone else's life seems to be so much more together than yours. You think about how you haven't spoken to your parents in a year now, because they didn't understand your frustration and were too busy worrying about the fact that you have started to smoke. You think about how you haven't written a letter to yourself in so long, because you weren't sure if you would ever read this letter, and now you feel like you can't read it because you are afraid of what will happen if you don't accomplish everything you set out to do. You start to cry. And then you hear something that snaps you out of it. Someone is playing a guitar not too far away, and the sound of the guitar is amazing. So amazing that it makes you feel like you are 10 years old again, and everything makes sense. You didn't realize how lost you had gotten in your own mind until you heard that guitar and it felt like someone reached into your heart and gave you a kick in the stomach, clearing away all the confusion and angst. You look up and see who is playing and smile. They are really good, you haven't seen a guitarist play in a long time, you have to check them out. The guitarist is sitting on a rug, around a fire, and you have to walk up a small hill to get to them. As you get closer, you see that the guitarist is not alone, there are several other people around the fire with them, and you realize that it is a jam session. Everyone is welcome to play, you can sit, you can dance, you can play. And you play too. You pick up the guitar, you haven't played in a long time, and you start playing along with the others. You are no longer lost, you are home. The song ends, and there is a moment of silence, and then another song starts. It is a slow song, and you put down your guitar and you start dancing. You haven't danced in so long, it feels strange, awkward, but somehow it just comes back to you. The guitar comes back, and you are again lost in your own mind, only this time you are lost in the moment. You close your eyes, and you start moving with the music. The song ends, and there is another moment of silence, and then you see a familiar face. A face that you haven't seen in a long time, a face that you haven't seen at all for the last year. But here it is, and it is beaming at you. You see that it is a song, and the song is called \"Dear Myself\". You smile, and you start singing along. The song ends, and it is time for another song. And another. And another. And after a few hours the jam session finally comes to an end. Everyone starts to filter out, you haven't seen most of the people who were playing with you, but you are happy to see that you still know most of the others by name. Your legs are a little bit sore from all the dancing, but you know that it will actually be more relaxing to just sit around the fire and talk for a while. The guitar comes back, and you pick it up, and this time you start playing a song for yourself. A song that you have been wanting to play for a long time, a song that you have been thinking about for a long time, a song that you haven't played in a long time, but now feels right in this moment. It takes some time for the song to finish, but when it does you feel satisfied. You walk over to the guitar, and you see something on it. There is a small note that says \"Dear Myself, I love you, whatever you do, just love yourself first. Your friend, A\" with a heart next to it. You look around and you see other people leaving notes for themselves. One says \"Dear Myself, I love you, you can stop eating pasta for once and try something new. Your friend, Giovanni\". Another says \"Dear Myself, I love you, you have been waiting for this opportunity for so long, go for it!\", and there are several other people leaving notes",
    "South Wonston is a small village in the county of Norfolk,England, located about south of London and close to the North Sea coast. It is situated within the district of Waveney, within the county of Norfolk. The village is located close to the A12 and A140 roads and has a common station with buses to Lowestoft, Norwich and North Walsham. South Wonston was in the media spotlight in 2018 when its Church of England parish church was extensively repaired and renewed, including a new pulpit, pews, medieval coffin lid font, Royal Naval flags, lighting and ceiling roses. The village has a public house, the Chequers, which was built in the 17th century. It is now operated as a private house. South Wonston lies just outside the proposed sites for the new High Speed 2 railway and it is expected that development of the railway will be the key future industry for the village.

    "The Cartmel Masterplan is a modernist office village in the Peak District National Park in England. The village was designed in the early 1950s by town planner Patrick Abercrombie in collaboration with architect Robert Matthew Burns. Abercrombie intended the village to be an \"ideal community\" in which people would live close to where they worked. The village was constructed between 1954 and 1964 in an Erskine type scheme, with three curved terraced streets radiating from a central junction formed by the junction of the principal A6144 road with Chapel Street, the eastern entry to the village. The village is exemplified as a utopian post-war design, with extensive amenities provided within the village. The public houses are considered excellent, and there are large green space areas and a children's play area at the junction of Chapel Street and Ebbw Vale Road. The housing is in a range of heights and styles, with a landscaped garden designed for each house. Residents own their own houses and the village is run as a private community by a homeowners' association. The village is administered from a parish council office in Chapel Street. The village has provided very few lettings over the years, despite its popularity with British people living in the Peak District as a rural idyll, as the maintenance costs are very high. In contrast, the village has always been much less popular with British people living outside of the Peak District, as it is very remote from any main settlements and has a relatively low population.",

Inhibition of caspase, an essential enzyme in apoptosis, is a potential target for inhibition of apoptosis and thus for treatment of cancers and other diseases. Baculoviruses encode inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins that interfere with caspases, and we identified a baculovirus inhibitor of caspase-1 (casp-1) homologue from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), named brfv1. Amino acid sequence comparison and bioinformatics analyses revealed that brfv1 shares common features with other known IAP proteins. Recombinant Brfv1 protein contained a thioredoxin-like domain and inhibited caspase-1 and -3 with K(i) of 1.5 and 6 nM, respectively,",

    "Broad Street School is a historic school at the intersection of Broad and North Broad streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was designed by John Havill and built in 1881. It is three stories in height and nine bays wide. It features paired wooden doors with rounded hoods and windows with rounded sills and lintels. The building is located within the West Market district and is surrounded by commercial buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was renovated in 2006. The building is owned by a developer and is set to become a 14-story building. Broad Street School was listed as one of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) buildings in the region, and is included in a 1998 survey of historic public and commercial buildings in Philadelphia and the surroundings which was also published by the Library of Congress. In 2009, the Broad Street School was used as a location for a scene in The Social Network, a movie about the founding of Facebook. In 2013, it was announced that a reality show called School Pride, which follows a group of inner-city students through the process of transforming their school into a GCLS (Government-Controlled Living Site), would be filmed at the Broad Street School for its first season. In February 2020, it was reported that the Philadelphia school district was considering selling the Broad Street School due to its \"skyrocketing\" maintenance costs.

The '183 publication provides a number of advantages over prior art technologies for notifying a monitoring service of an alarm condition at a facility. For example, the '183 publication allows for notification of an alarm condition to be sent over a cellular network or a wired network with a sufficiently high bandwidth, rather than being limited to an e-mail or a phone line. Also, a large number of facilities can be monitored using a minimal number of sensors, with minimal infrastructure requirements at the facilities. In addition, a facility owner can be provided with information about events at the facility, without disclosing any personally identifiable information of the owner. The '183 publication, however, fails to provide additional notification options in the event of an alarm condition at a facility.

We talked to a water expert to get the scoop. It means you’ll be using more water Although you may not notice it right away, turning on a hose to do your dishes or taking a long shower uses more water than usual during a water short. If you haven’t been flushing the toilet as much or showering as often, you might notice increased water usage. But the big water hogs are your lawn and landscaping, your sprinklers, and car washes. The good news is that you can save water and reduce your water bill by doing simple things, like replacing your lawn with drought-tolerant plants and using less water while you’re washing your car. It’s not the end of the world, but it is bad California is in the midst of a historic drought, and it’s getting worse. As of July 2014, 44.5 million people in California were in some stage of water restriction, and some towns have been under a water emergency for nearly two years. While one might think of drought as temporary and a natural part of life in California, it actually caused the state to sell off 28,000 acres of land for redevelopment purposes, 11 million trees were removed to make room for the water they needed to survive, and six counties were declared natural disaster areas. Hurricane water restrictions means most people in California must reduce their water usage by thirty percent. This might sound excessive, but it’s not, because we depend on water for many things, like showering, filling pools, and irrigating lawns and landscapes. During a water emergency, residents are asked to use less water in-between watering schedules, instead of waiting until their next watering schedule, when the water will be even less effective. It’s best to check with your local water authority to see what restrictions are in place. If you have a sprinkler, be sure to set it to a low water setting so less water is wasted. Also, be smart about",

    "Empress Ma, wife of Emperor Wu of Han, was born in 26 BCE and died in 8 CE. She was of the Wang clan and was married to Emperor Wu of Han for more than forty years. Little is known about her life, as there are no records of her personally engaging in any acts of political intrigue, and all of what we know about her was recorded down by her second cousin once removed, Marquess of Liexinos, who may have aimed to celebrate her life and promote her legend.

    "Baluarte de Santiago is a bastion in Madrid, Spain that is famous for being the last point of defence of Madrid during the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939. During the Civil War (a conflict where the Spanish Nationalists fought against the Popular Front) the Baluarte de Santiago was used as a hospital for the wounded from both sides. After the Nationalist victory in the war the building was used as a hospital again but this time for members of the Falange (the political party of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, president of Spain at the time) and their families. Following the end of the Spanish Civil War the building was abandoned and fell into ruin for many years. In the 1990s restoration work was carried out on the building with the help of millions of euros from the Madrid city government.

    "The Kalamazoo-class monitor is a U.S. Navy hull classification symbol for a class of large ocean-going monitors used for naval surveillance and detection. The first two ships of the class, USS Kalamazoo (LCS 1) and USS ElPaso (LCS 2), were commissioned in the late 1990s and early 2000s. All four ships are in active service with the US Navy. The Kalamazoo-class monitors are the last major modernization of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class battlecruisers, which were designed in the late 19th century. The class is the largest and most expensive hull classification symbol in the history of the U.S. Navy, at over $7 billion per ship. The Kalamazoo-class monitors are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and targeting systems, including the Phalanx close-in weapon system, the AN/SLQ-24 Nixie system, the Science and Spacegrade Lakehouse and the ECObus system, and are highly mobile, capable of operating across the full spectrum of naval warfare. The ships are characterized by a relatively small crew of about 270, reduced from the full crew of around 600 of the previous Oliver Hazard Perry class, in response to military recommendations to save money. However, the small crew size has led to complaints from some sailors that the Kalamazoo-class ships are \"almost parasitic\" in their culture, seeking out combat zones to maximize their military utility while minimizing the time they spend in port. The ships' considerable capability has resulted in them being employed in various military operations around the world. In 2009, USS Kalamazoo took part in the international effort to prevent Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi from using the Libyan city of Sirte as a base from which to attack civilians in North Africa and the Middle East, an operation code-named Odyssey Dawn. In 2014, the ship was sent to the South China Sea in response to territorial encroachments by the Philippines and China; in October of the same year, the ship was deployed to the Persian Gulf in response to increased tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The ships have received criticism for their high costs, deteriorating readiness and the risk of a major naval conflict that they would be ineffective against modern Russian warships. Critics have described the ships as \"expensive floating museums\" and \"beachheads for deployable sea mines\". The US Navy has considered withdrawing some or all of the ships from active service to reduce the overall cost of the fleet, but has faced opposition from Congress, which provided funding for the ships regardless of how they were employed. The lead ship of the class, USS Kalamazoo, has been named the best aircraft carrier in the world for the last three years running, based on surveys of ships' officers and personnel. The ship was re-designated as the USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) on December 14, 2016. The class comprises four ships: USS Kalamazoo, USS ElPaso, USS Little Rock and USS Tucson. All are in active service with the US Navy, with the last two ships having been delivered in 2014 and 2015. The US Navy plans to keep these ships through the 2020s, with life extension programs being implemented on all four ships, in the event that they are needed for future military operations. The ships are named after American cities in the state of Arkansas: Little Rock, Fayetteville, Little Rock (which was originally named for Kalamazoo, but was renamed after becoming a city in 1937) and Tucson. The US Navy faced criticism in 2016, following the collision of the John C. Stennis and the Lexington during a training operation in the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy decided to rename Little Rock and Tucson in a competitive process, determining that the name value would be more valuable as a Navy ship than as a repository for historical artifacts. John C. Stennis was decommissioned from the US Navy in 2023. In 2021, the US Navy moved to decommission the two remaining ships of the class, USS Little Rock and USS Tucson, due to cost concerns and a determination that the ships were not operable without substantial cost and maintenance, risking \"near-term modernization obsolescence\". These decommissionings were completed in 2024. The class is the last major modernization of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class battlecruisers, which were designed in the late 19th century.

    "Project TL, short for Training Load, is a system to quantify the total amount of strain placed on athletes during training. The scale was devised by Timothy Lesmeister and is used extensively in sports like soccer and basketball. The scale has been criticized for focusing on external factors to the exclusion of athlete ability to recover, and does not incorporate recovery into its calculation. y edinburgh-laboratory. neurone.wikipedia LEARN MORE Further information on Project TL is available on the Project TL website: https://www.projecttl.com/ In sport-specific training loads are commonly calculated for a variety of reasons. In team sports, loads are used to monitor the conditioning level of individual players. In sport-specific drills, loads can be used to measure individual player performance, to control the intensity and thus improve the efficacy of the training process. In inter-squad training, loads can be used to compare different teams in order to determine which team displays the most efficient conditioning. misuse of the TL scale has been heavily criticized by the sport sciences, who point out that the scale focuses on external factors of training and does not incorporate recovery into its calculations. Furthermore, the scale was designed to detect training load, but not acute pathological load. A high load score does not necessary reflect a high training effect, it could also for example indicate the presence of an injury. Additionally, the calculation of training loads is based on the number of training hours, which can be assessed with moderate accuracy (~80% reliability), but has a poor temporal resolution, i.e. it only detects acute loads on a relatively coarse time scale.",

    "George Washington Carroll (May 27, 1832 – December 20, 1910) was an American politician and military officer who served as the 15th United States Secretary of the Treasury, Republican Party's candidate for President of the United States in 1856, and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1857 to 1862. Carroll's national political prominence began when he successfully campaigned for the Republican Party's nomination for president in 1856. His candidacy was unpopular in the South because he was a native of Maryland, which was a slave state. As a result, he only won eleven Northern states and the District of Columbia, while Democrats chose Abraham Lincoln and launched an unsuccessful effort to split the Republican vote. He was the last incumbent president to die in office, and he was the only president to be a candidate for re-election and lose. developed a keen interest in politics at a young age, and was educated at St. Mary's School in West Brandywine, Maryland. He was employed at a variety of jobs before being admitted to the bar in 1849. Two years later, Carroll married Susan Deborah Naumburger, with whom he had six children. The Carrols were a devoutly Catholic family, and Susan was active in the church. They lived in a small house behind their church, where Carroll spent most of his time raising his family. Carroll moved to Ohio in 1850 to start a new life. He established a law practice and became active in the local Republican Party. He also campaigned for the party's candidates for office at the state level. In 1851, he was appointed Deputy Marshals for Ohio. Two years later, he moved to Chicago, where he continued his political activities. He was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1854, and was appointed United States Collector of Internal Revenue for the Chicago district the following year. Carroll was appointed to the Republican National Committee in 1857 and was elected to the 54th United States Congress as a Republican from Illinois's 16th congressional district. During his tenure in Congress, he introduced a bill to create a national mint. In 1859, Republican leaders met in Chicago to consider whom to choose as their candidate for the presidential election the following year. Senator William H. Seward of New York, who was the party's front-runner, had an abrasive personality and was disliked by many Republicans. The meeting was deadlocked for nearly two hours until Carroll, who spoke softly and was well-liked by the other attendees, stood and offered a compromise: Seward would adopt a more conciliatory approach. Believing him to be more acceptable to both northerners and southerners, Seward agreed. As a result, the Illinois politician was selected as the Republican Party's nominee. Carroll had a difficult time campaigning. His positions on slavery were unpopular in the South, while his northern supporters were disaffected by his lack of commitment to lower taxes. In the end, Lincoln won the 1860 election, while Carroll carried five states, including his home state of Maryland. He served as one of President Lincoln's appointees on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank System, but resigned in 1866 due to poor health.

    "Suceava Monastery is an Armenian monastery in Suceava, Romania, located about 30 km from the capital city, Bucharest. The monastery was built between 1784 and 1839 on the site of a previous church built in 1751. The monastery was built by Prince Grigory Potemkin, who, as a tribute to the Armenian Kingdom taken over by Hadjin Jstepsi, erected this church on its former location. The first monks arrived in 1784 and the monastery was consecrated on February 28, 1839. Over time, the monastery was patronized by many public figures, such as Alexandru Ghica of Suceava, Prince Constantin Kelyes Dogodilescu or Ioan Gaga or Mihai Eminescu. Its library, housing over 1000 books, is the most important repository of Armenian manuscripts in Romania. Today the monastery is under the responsibility of the Romanian Armenian community, serving as a cultural centre as well as a shelter. The nuns of the monastery live in a separate building. As a cultural centre, the monastery hosts several events throughout the year, such as art exhibitions, movie nights or children's workshops. Suceava Monastery is included on the list of monuments institutionally protected in Romania.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a major regulator of diverse biological processes during development and homeostasis through the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. TGF-beta signals through serine/threonine kinase receptors that upon ligand binding undergo rapid removal from the cell surface, leading to the recruitment of a large receptor complex containing Smad proteins. To signal efficiently, TGF-beta receptors (TbetaRs) must undergo sequential cleavage at conserved motifs, first by the trypsin-like protease, plasmin, to remove the amino-terminal pro-region, and then by the proprotein convertase furin in the extracellular domain to generate a mature TbetaR capable of transmitting the signal. This review will discuss our current understanding of the regulation of furin's activity in TGF-beta signal transduction, with an emphasis on the multifaceted roles of furin as a sheddase and in TbetaR folding. In addition, the activities of furin in other signaling contexts, as well as its role in tumor invasion and metastasis, will be examined. These studies will provide a foundation for understanding furin's role in the normal biology of TGF-beta and its contribution to human disease.<|endoftext|>Stephen Shankland Stephen Shankland is an American computer scientist and software engineer.

The season consisted of ten sprint car and sixteen touring car races, including the 2002 Winternationals, which was held as a support race to the 2002 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, which was won by Bobby Labonte. The IROC XIV championship was won by John Allart after winning the last three races of the season. RESTRICTIONS: All vehicles used in the IROC series had to be production vehicles built before January 1, 2001. Engine sizes were capped at 3.8L displacement (as of 2001) and racing fuel had to be 95 octane. ~~IMPORTANT: Please see the category listing for IROC on Wikipedia to ensure your article is written for the correct season.~~ Life has gotten more complex. More crowded. More busy. Sometimes it feels like there isn't enough hours in the day to get everything done. But having more activities, experiences and responsibilities can also mean having more opportunities to connect with other people and expand your horizons. The social web has changed how we do all of that, bringing people closer together, finding new interests to pursue, and sharing experiences across the globe. The Internet has evolved, and so has our lives on the web. Welcome to the next phase of Life as we know it. This season of the IROC series was notable for a new chassis manufacturer, TRD (Toyota Racing Development). The new chassis, the TRD##, was based on the proven SPRINT car design and was available for both touring car and sprint car racing. Several competitors and team managers expressed skepticism and concern over the new chassis due to its lower weight and unproven track record. TRD responded to these concerns by sponsoring a team of drivers for the full season, with an emphasis on participating in all the races, while also providing technical support for the new chassis. The results of this strategy are evident in the competitive results posted by the TRD-sponsored drivers. In total, 9 TRD cars won races out of a possible total of 10 and the championship was won by John Allart driving a TRD-sponsored car.",

What if the main menu was a screenshot of you doing the coolest parkour you could possibly do in the Alexander Platz?

    "Chicago City Railway was the third municipal railway in Chicago. It was operated by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, a subsidiary of the City of Chicago. It operated between Chicago and Ashland/63rd on the Upper Side, and Kimball and the Loop. The last train on the line operated between the Loop and Chicago Union Station on September 30, 1958. The railway was created to help facilitate construction of the Chicago River aqueduct by providing an outlet to new areas beyond the municipal boundaries of the City of Chicago. The CRTC was formed as a private corporation in 1903, and constructed the railway using bond money. The railway was not involved in the rapid rise of the Chicago neighborhood from poor to wealthy beginning in the 1910s; it was too expensive for most residents. Public transportation on the railway became more practical with the advent of the automobile, and the city shut down the railway in 1958. In 1975, the CRTC made money by renting out its Union Station facilities to the Federal government for use as a post office. Because of this, the CRTC has retained the station and its immediate environs; various city landmarks are located nearby, including the Fredrick K. Berry Hall (home of the Chicago Architecture Foundation), the Art Institute of Chicago and several universities and schools. The last private owners of the railway were the Canadian National Railway (CNR) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), who trackage rights over the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway (EJER) into Union Station. CNR and CPR kept the railway in service until 1995, when the new owner of CNR, the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), closed the railway down for good.",

Due to the ideal of objectivity that pervades much of the scientific community, the nature of the scientific communication process may at times lead to a situation where information and ideas are selectively presented or suppressed in a way that would not be tolerated in other contexts. The relationship between scientists and the public has also been impacted by advances in scientific knowledge; thus, a consensus has emerged that the public's right to know should precede its right to remain ignorant, at least in fields such as medicine or nuclear power. The scientific community has a wide range of attitudes toward communication. Many scientists feel they should not communicate their findings beyond their immediate peers. They may also be reluctant to publish negative or inconvenient findings, and this trait is sometimes called \"grey literature.\" A 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that most scientists were reluctant to share negative findings, with 71% citing the need to complete further research as the reason for not sharing data that does not show a result in a positive light. Nevertheless, many scientists are eager to communicate their research. For example, an analysis of the pages of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) journals Science and Nature found that most articles contained at least one figure or table that could be considered a \"publication\" in the traditional sense (i.e., that could be sent or shared via email or uploaded to a website). Due to the potential for positive or negative impacts, the nature of scientific discovery often means that scientists are not solely interested in understanding and communicating the implications of their own research but instead are focused on the communication of broader general knowledge. To meet this challenge, the scientific community has developed codes of conduct, standards of evidence and \"translation\" services. Scientific communication has also been called \" spin\", \"communicated research\", and \"checked knowledge\". History Ancient Greece and Rome During the Roman Empire and the succeeding medieval period, scientific communication was typically handled by members of the same profession, for example between a physician and a patient, between a lawyer and a client, or between a mathematician and a scholar. If the information was to be communicated to a wider audience, it was usually done so via books or oral lectures. For example, Democritus, who lived between 460 and 370 BC, is credited with the first scientific treatise, the Canon, discussing properties of matter and how they change over time. It was not meant to be read exclusively by its original audience of fellow Greek atomists but it was probably sufficiently clear for them to follow its basic messages. However, the Canon has not survived in its entirety, only a selection of sentences which have come down to us. However, in antiquity there were also a number of instances where a knowledge creator communicated knowledge to an audience that was not necessarily prepared to receive it, or even able to do so, for example when the knowledge creator was speaking to another audience of specialists. In these instances, the knowledge creator was mostly interested in engaging in a dialogue with the other specialists, rather than in reaching a wider audience. In this respect, the Canon of Democritus has been read continuously over the centuries, and even though the original audience was not identical to the current one, there is dialogue between them. As the concept of specialization became more firmly established, communication of scientific knowledge was increasingly organized along the lines of the tradition of oral or written lectures. The most important landmarks in this development are the establishment of university centres of learning (scholae) which combined lectures with the recruitment and residence of students, and the composition of textbooks that summarized the knowledge and transmitted it from one generation to the next. The most famous examples of such textbooks are Aristotle's works on natural history and medicine. Many different channels were available for the communication of knowledge, and in many cases more than one channel was used at the same time for the same purpose. In antiquity, this is exemplified by the sending of a physician to a patient not only in the form of a written prescription, but also by means of an oral explanation. Renaissance and early modern Europe During the Early Modern period, Western science and culture was also characterized by an increase in the number of people who were able to read. New opportunities to communicate science arose with the introduction of publications such as books, journals and newsletters. However, education was still primarily the prerogative of the elite, and so public interest in science was mainly limited to spectacular discoveries and spectacular applications of knowledge. In order to bring together scholars from various disciplines, the natural sciences, mathematics and",
    "A gateway station is part of a wireless network that lets phones connect to the Internet through the PAAC. The Gateway station sits on top of the wireless network that connects phones to the Internet. This network is usually owned and operated by a wireless carrier or Internet Service Provider. All phones on the network must send data through the PAAC, which is the country's most advanced and largest wireless broadband network. The PAAC network is available to anyone, but the best results are usually obtained using devices and applications that support the Draft Wireless Network standard. The PAAC network provides speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. That's enough bandwidth to stream hi-definition video. As of November 2023, PAAC has more than 20 million active users and 150,000 nodes. Together, these users and nodes represent more than 20 giga bytes of data being transferred every day. The PAAC network is connected to the Internet and runs its own DNS, DHCP and NTP servers. It also has a large network of nodes in schools, public libraries, and other public places that let users connect with little or no setup. Through the gateway, users can access the Internet without using a personal computer or Wi-Fi router. The gateway allows simultaneous voice and data connectivity, so you can check email or browse the web while on a phone call. Gateway stations can be used with all devices that have wireless Internet access, including laptops, web browsers, smart phones, and wireless speakers. The PAAC network is offered in seven countries: the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. PAAC is managed by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (ECRCC). The PAAC network is operated by a consortium of global technology companies including Apple, Inc., Google, Ltd., Intel Corporation, Microsoft, and Samsung. The PAAC network is funded in part by grants from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (ECRCC).

    "Harriet Ward (1832–1915) was an English educator, author, and pioneer in the field of special education. Born in London, England, Ward was the oldest of nine children. Her father was a solicitor and a member of Parliament. Ward began studying at a school for young ladies when she was twelve years old. At nineteen, Ward began teaching at a school for children with disabilities. During this time, in 1862, Ward's friend, Julia Morgan, introduced her to other women educators, who were interested in forming an association for women in teaching. In April 1864, Ward became one of the founding members of the Women's Educational Association (WEA). In 1867, Ward published her first book, Manual of Intellectual Offences and DEFENCE, which was based on her classes at the school for children with disabilities. In 1871, Ward published her most famous work, The Duties of Special Teachers. In this book, Ward provided advice to women who sought to become special teachers. In 1872, Ward and her sister, Martha, started their own school for girls, in Saffron Walden. The school only accepted ten students; however, Ward taught over one hundred students while at the school. Ward remained active in the WEA until 1874. She then went on to author more books, including: A Voice from the Centre: a series of addresses on homeopathy, delivered before the Women's Educational Association in September 1877 (1877), Thoughts on Toys, delivered before the Women's Educational Association in November 1878 (1878), and The Principles of Teaching: a text book for primary schools (1880). In 1881, Ward was hired as the superintendent of schools for New Jersey. This is where she met and began to correspond with Susan A. Hersey, who would later become her colleague and a fellow pioneer in the field of special education. In 1888, Ward retired from her position as superintendent of schools. In 1895, Ward and Hersey opened the first school for the education of exceptional children in America. The school, known as the Jersey School for the Education of Exceptional Children, opened in East Orange, New Jersey. Ward continued teaching at the school until her retirement in 1896.",
    "China–Malawi relations refers to the relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Malawi. Both countries established diplomatic ties in 1964. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the Chinese government has taken multiple steps to support Malawi in various areas. These included extending technical and financial assistance. The two states enjoy close relations, with the president of Malawi becoming the honorary president of China, and the Chinese ambassador to Malawi representing China in the country. Since 1970, China has been Malawi's largest bilateral aid donor, providing over $1 billion in assistance. This included providing over 60 percent of the country's fund for agriculture and economic development. However, political tensions arose between the two in the late 2000s over the treatment of land in Malawi by Chinese companies, and in 2009, Chinese President Hu Jintao suspended all further military training for Malawi. However, since 2012, the assistance has increased, with China providing over $60 million in 2012 and over $70 million in 2017. As of 2017, around 20,000 Malawians work in China, primarily in the garment industry. In May 2018, President of China, Xi Jinping, became the first Chinese president to visit Malawi. This was the first visit by a Chinese president to Malawi since 2009, as well as the first by a head of state since the death of former President Qu Zhou in 2008. In November 2019, Malawi President Mutharika died, succeeded by Peter Mutharika, his second son, who is a politician by profession. The Chinese government made an effort to ensure Mutharika's son becomes the president, and donated boats and medicine to the country. Although relations between the two countries have remained cordial, there are some areas of tension. For example, Chinese companies have been accused of land expropriation in Malawi. Additionally, Chinese President Xi Jinping described the relationship as a \"partner-client\" relationship, which has been contested by the government of Malawi. President Xi's 2018 visit to Malawi was followed by an increased military presence from both nations. This included the deployment of several hundred Chinese military police to the area of the border between the two countries, the first such deployment. Additionally, Beijing has invested in several infrastructure projects in Malawi, such as a road and railway, and has increased political support for President Mutharika.",

    "Ski boots are specialised footwear used for boarding and skiing. They vary in design, depending on use (e.g. rental or purchased) and intended use (a right boot for right-footed skiers and a left boot for left-footed skiers). There are several types of boots for different activities: alpine (for skiing), Nordic (for training and cross-country skiing), hockey, touring, and rock climbing. Ski boots are secured on the wearer's feet with bindings. These bindings may be either rigid (metal or plastic plates that flex but do not deform), or soft (a laced shoe with a moulded mid-sole that flexes). Soft bindings are more flexible but less stable; they are commonly used for off-piste or gym skiing. Ski boots also include an integral boot top (or overboot) that covers the lower part of the wearer's leg to keep snow out of the socks and lower legs. Ski boots are an essential piece of ski clothing and form a critical element of safety gear. Ski boots are relatively expensive, costing hundreds of dollars each. Lower quality boots can be ruined by deforming or tearing a soft binding in a high impact collision. While there are several types of ski boots, they generally all follow similar design principles. The lower leg is firmly secured inside the boot with a lacing system. This helps to keep the boots tight and secure the lower leg in the boot. A cuff surrounds the ankle to keep snow out of the boot and to provide stability. The tongue is designed to flex up and over the rider's foot to allow the boot to move with the feet's movements. The upper is commonly made from a pliant but rigid material, such as leather or plastic, with metal reinforcements inside the upper for strength. Ski boots also often include a soft midsole and stiff soleplate for additional stability. Ski boots are made and sold by a limited number of manufacturers. The largest of these is Ross, who also owns brand on their skis, Deerfoot. Other popular brands include K2, Blizzard, Black Crows, Nordica, Blizzard, Rossignol, True, Nordica, Kikau,... There are also many specialty brands such as Patta, Helly Hansen,... While the manufacture of ski boots is a multi-billion dollar industry, modern technology has led to the development of mass-produced composite materials that are lighter in weight and designed to more accurately reflect modern fabric technology. These designs have not caught on, likely due to the perceived cost premium and higher maintenance requirements associated with these boots.",
    "Multnomah was a sternwheel-powered steamboat that operated on the Willamette River in Oregon, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The vessel was built in1899 at Portland, Oregon, by owner and operator Russell Stover, and operated on Multnomah Channel into the early years of World War II. The sternwheeler was acquired by Douglas Munroe in 1946 and again served into the 1960s. The Multnomah was lost sometime after 1960. Multnomah was a business as well as a means of transport. Russell Stover started the business in 1898 as an importer and distributor of Portland-made goods. The company grew to include Multnomah Channel, a logistics and transport business centered around the vessel, as well as a real estate operation and a campground on Sandy River. Multnomah is the namesake of Portland, Oregon, and was an important part of the region's transport infrastructure from the early 20th century until it was lost by the early 1960s. The sternwheeler carried people and freight on the Willamette and Sandy rivers for nearly 56 years. The company built other vessels in the Multnomah series, all of which were lost to vandalism, collisions, or salvage. The most famous of these other Multnomah vessels is the upstreamFERD, which sank in 1926 and was salvaged in 1953. In total, Multnomah Company owned or operated six sternwheelers on the Willamette River, all of which were lost by the early 1960s. The company's last sternwheeler,, was acquired by Douglas Munroe and restored for use on the Willamette for a time but was damaged in a storm and sank in 1965. The loss of the Multnomah company fleet had a significant effect on the future of river transport on the Willamette, leading to the revival of the Skookumchas fleet and eventual revival of the Clipper navigation company. Today, the sternwheeler Portland is the only remaining vessel of the original Multnomah company fleet. The abandoned hulk of the UpstreamFERD is visible on the Willamette River just north of Hamilton Island Docks in Portland, and is sometimes referred to as the \"missing link\" between the old Multnomah fleet and the Skookumchas fleet. The company also has a legacy in real estate. Multnomah Channel Inc. owned and operated a campground and other commercial properties on Sandy River between Sandy Boulevard and Alameda Avenue, just south of the Oregon Zoo and east of the Lloyd Center. This property is now the site of the Oregon Convention Center and on the northern edge of the district that hosts the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team. Multnomah is a title given to many different sternwheelers, all of which were lost to obsolescence or else are in varying states of repair. The company named at least five different Multnomah sternwheelers, the first of which was built in 1898. The last Multnomah sternwheeler was acquired by Douglas Munroe in 1946. Some sources suggest that the historic distinction of \"Multnomah\" is more a brand name than a unique identity, and that the various ships bearing that name belonged to different companies. The term \"Multnomah\" may have been used as early as 1897 to describe a type of sternwheeler, but this is not universally accepted. There is no known documentation to show that the company formally adopted the name \"Multnomah\" until 1898, when the first Multnomah sternwheeler was built. The Portland company owned or operated five sternwheelers between 1898 and 1929. The names of these ships were the Multnomah, Columbia, Dalles City, Columbia II, and Clackamas. The last three of these were all built after 1900. In addition to these five sternwheelers, the company also may have operated or owned one or more unnamed sternwheelers between 1898 and 1929. After the company's 1929 bankruptcy, all five of the company's Multnomah sternwheelers were purchased by other companies, usually within the next five years. The last Multnomah sternwheeler, the Columbia, was purchased by Donald Ingram in 1933. The Dalles City was purchased by Samuel M. Scott in 1933. The company also did not own or operate the Columbia II after 1900, so it is unclear who owned that vessel between 1901 and 1903. In 1944, the Clackamas was being salvaged for parts when its owner, J.P. Harrell, was arrested for bankruptcy and the Multnomah was listed for sale at auction. The Clackamas was purchased by George P. Kirk at auction for $2,500, and the Columbia II was acquired by Munroe Dry",
    "Disruptive selection is a form of selection that favors the evolution of traits that would normally be considered unfavorable. Disruptive selection acts to accelerate the evolution of change. Disruptive selection is often associated with Darwinian evolution, but can operate on alleles or other genetic units other than individual organisms. It was first proposed by George John Williams in 1951. Some examples of disruptive selection are: - artificial selection in plants and animals - the domestication of animals and plants - the divergence of pigeon breeds - the evolution of parasitic behavior - mutations that cause disease such as sickle cell anemia Williams proposed that disruptive selection would accelerate the rate of evolution of traits that negatively interact with the environment or other traits. For example, the evolution of sickle cell anemia would be accelerated by the positive selection for children with anemia who require larger blood volumes. In applied fields, disruptive selection is sometimes referred to as diversification selection. The importance of disruptive selection is that it can lead to rapid evolution and adaptation to novel challenges. This is important in modern agriculture, biological control, animal husbandry, and plant cultivation, where disruptive selection can lead to improved yields, more robust populations, and faster changes to better survive new environmental challenges. There is also evidence of disruptive selection at the species level in the form of extinction events. A well-documented example is the dinosaurs, who appeared to be favored by disruptive selection for their susceptibility toavian predators, but ultimately succumbed to extinction. Disruptive selection is sometimes difficult to demonstrate in applied fields due to the challenges of measurement. Genetic variability can obscure evidence of disruptive selection, and the statistical analysis to demonstrate disruptive selection is complex. Despite this, studies have shown that disruptive selection can explain a significant proportion of variation in observed data. Overall, disruptive selection plays an important role in evolution, and is an important mechanism of rapid evolution in applied fields. This topic is discussed in more detail in several publications, including - \"The Selfish Gene\" by Richard Dawkins - \"The Genie in the Bottle: Heroism and Delirium in thepharmaceutical Revolution\" by Julia Flynn - \"Catching a Disadvantage\" by Susan Greenfield These publications also provide additional context for disruptive selection. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_selection Note: The phrases \"Darwinian evolution\" and \"disruptive selection\" often are used interchangeably, but have different meanings. Darwinian evolution is a long process of small changes that can lead to big changes over time. Disruptive selection focuses on a specific form of change that accelerates the rate of evolution. George John Williams was a British evolutionary biologist who proposed disruptive selection in 1951. The selection theory he proposed has since been applied to a range of situations, including: - artificial selection in plants and animals - the domestication of animals and plants - the divergence of pigeon breeds - the evolution of parasitic behavior - mutations that cause disease such as sickle cell anemia Disruptive selection has been shown to explain a significant amount of variation in observed data, often more than Darwinian evolution.

    "Giuseppe Pancaro (born 23 August 1933) is an Italian football coach and former player. He played as a midfielder, and was part of the Italian team that won the silver medal in football at the 1956 Summer Olympics. His professional career began with hometown club A.S. Roma before he was selected to play for the Italian national team. He won nine Serie A titles and one Italian Cup while playing for Juventus, Napoli and Roma. He later worked as a coach throughout Europe, including several roles with the Italian national team. Pancaro played in both the1956 Olympics and 1960 Olympic football tournaments. He was a key member of the Italian team that won the silver medal, Italy's first ever Olympic silver medal. He started all four of Italy's group stage matches and scored the only goal of the tournament in a 1–0 victory over hosts France. After Italy's 1–1 draw with Mexico in the round of 16, the Italians needed to win their next match by a two-goal margin to guarantee advancement to the semi-finals. The Italians fell behind early in the second half before Pancaro collected a through ball from Giovanni Galli, and proceeded to beat French goalkeeper Philippe Chapuis. In the semi-finals, Italy faced Uruguay and needed a win by any scoreline to advance to the final. The match remained 0–0 after 90 minutes, leading to a penalty shootout that Italy won 4–3. In 1993, Pancaro was one of the founding members of A.S. Roma. He turned 80 years old in 2017 and is still closely connected to the club, having served as vice president since 2011. Giuseppe Pancaro played professional football for nine seasons, from 1956 to 1965, representing A.S. Roma, Juventus FC, Napoli and Roma.

    "Sampling is a music theory concept and musical practice of using a small portion of a song to provide a foundation for new development, often taken from another song. The practice was developed byBritish musician James Brown, whose song \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" was modeled after jazz musicianMaryOBellaLaurant's \"Happy Phasing\". The implementation in Papa's Got a Brand New Bag included sampling the elastic sound of a guitar string. The sampling technique has since been utilized in a wide variety of musical styles and has grown into a highly regulated art form, with publishers of copyrights for samples — often referred to as \"sampleshells\" —being paid high licensing fees. Sampling has had a significant cultural impact on mainstream popular music, inspiring entire genres of music, such as hip hop music, dance music and pop music. Well-known examples of musical compositions which incorporate samples of other songs include the Beatles' \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Helter Skelter\", \"Get Off My Cloud\" and \"Day Tripper\", Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall\", Roy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman\" and ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\", Kraftwerk's \"Trans-EQuatorial Dot Matrix\" and Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\". Despite its importance in popular music, sampling is a widely misunderstood concept in the world of music theory. The exact definition and form of this music theory concept has been a subject of many academic studies.",
    "The Bourgeois Government or the Republic Government is a term used by Karl Marx to describe the political systems in most countries in Europe in the 19th century. After the revolutions of 1848, the term was redefined by other socialist philosophers to refer to a minimum set of institutions and personnel needed to run a country effectively. The term was applied to several countries where the ruling classes converted to democracy and appointed parliaments, such as Finland in 1907, Sweden in 1909, Denmark in 1913 and Poland in 1918. The term was applied to describe the government of France in 1929, however the term was dropped after the two world wars. It was revived in 1955 by Jean-Louis Barrault in order to distinguish between the Third Republic and the Fourth Republic. Since then, the term has been used by socialists to describe any government which they consider does not fulfill the minimum requirements for a democratic government. The minimum requirements set forth by socialists are more extensive than the requirements needed to efficiently manage a country. The minimum requirements set forth by socialists are more extensive than the requirements needed to efficiently manage a country. This is the reason why these requirements have often been implemented in times of crisis, for example after World War 2. The requirements set by socialists include immunity for the upper class, necessary social services and minimum wage. The political spectrum usually splits governments into left-wing and right-wing. The left-wing governments usually set higher requirements than the right-wing governments. The left-wing governments usually establish public healthcare, subsidize education and regulate big business. The right-wing governments usually cut down taxes, leave social services to the states and regulate only big business. While the Bourgeois Government satisfies the minimum requirements for a democratic government, it fails to satisfy the more extensive requirements set by socialists.",

    "Gramicidin B is an antimicrobial protein produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. It is a linear unit-ramεί antibiotic, which forms membrane-impermeable pores in Gram-positive bacteria cell membranes. Gramicidin was the first cationic peptide antibiotic and is closely related to the later-discovered antibiotics tetracycline and NFLD-26. The precise mechanism of gramicine killing bacterial cells has not been fully characterized but it is known to involve interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane. Gramicidin B is active against many Gram-positive bacteria, as well as some Gram-negative bacteria and some fungi. It is used as an antimetabolic agent to model Gram-positive bacteria. Gramicidin B was discovered in 1943 by Professor Johannes Grammel at the University of Copenhagen. It is made up of 31 amino acids (plus an N-terminal methionine), with a typical mass of 3602 Da. It is slightly soluble in water, particularly at neutral pH (1.9 mg/L at pH 7), and is quite insoluble in many organic solvents. It is an amphipathic peptide, containing both hydrophobic and positively charged residues, which contributes to its biological activity. Gramicidin was initially synthesized by hydrolysis of gramicidin S, the macrocyclic antibiotic produced by Bacillus graminis. Total synthesis of gramicine began in 1951 and was completed in 1954 by Stig Sondergaard (Stig Sonneborn) and Ragnar Vestbjerg. Its structure was determined in 1951. Gramicidin S is converted to gramicine by NaOH treatment and subsequent precipitation with acid; the product is soluble in water. Gramicidin B is mainly used in studies of bacteria model systems as a specific inhibitor of bacterial membrane potential-dependent aspartate aminotransferase, which is encoded by the gdpP gene in many bacteria. It is not harmful to humans. In addition to its antibiotic properties, Gramicidin B has been used in the chemical synthesis of several oligopeptides, including oligoarginine, polyarginine, and several model poly-L-amino acids. Gramicidin B finds continued use in biotechnology as a promoter for protein production in Escherichia coli. Gramicidin B was the first cationic peptide antibiotic and is closely related to the later-discovered antibiotics tetracycline and NFLD-26. Gramicidin is the first member of the cationic antimicrobial protein family of antibiotics. It is the shortest of that family, consisting of 31 amino acid residues; its structure was determined in 1951. It forms aqueous pores in membranes of gram-positive bacteria, causing leakage of cellular contents and ultimately cell death. Gramicidin was the first of a new class of antibiotics, the gramicidins, whose further investigation was impeded by its degradation into inactive sub-units by a proteolytic enzyme in the culture medium of some Bacillus species. The amino-terminal residues of gramicidin are oxidized, mainly to a succinyl derivative. The first total synthesis of gramicidin was achieved in 1954 by Stig Sondergaard and Ragnar Vestbjerg. Gramicidin has been used in biotechnology to induce protein production in Escherichia coli. The mechanism of action of gramicidin has not been fully characterized. It is known to involve interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. It has been suggested that gramicidin forms transmembrane channels, although other studies indicate that its primary mode of action may involve the electropermeabilization of cell membranes. Gramicidin B is active against many Gram-positive bacteria, as well as some Gram-negative bacteria and some fungi. It is used as an antimetabolic agent to model Gram-positive bacteria.

    "Lolium perenne is a species of grass in the family Poaceae, also called meadow foxtail, rennaire, perenne, or simply grass. It is native to temperate regions of the world, and it is important globally as a crop and for recreational grazing. It is often used in landscaping as an ornamental grass. Several cultivars have been developed. The grain can be used to make flour, and the foliage is used in top dressing for soil enhancement. The Latin specific epithet perenne means perennial. This grass typically forms small tufts of green leaves, but its rhizomatous roots form large colonies spreading by means of stolons. They can produce new shoots almost annually, even under unfavourable conditions. This growth makes the grass very aggressive and tenacious. It is consumed by livestock and is a common component of ruminant forage. It is sometimes used in roller sprinklers to reduce mosquito larvae, and it is also used in lawnmowers. In the United States, it is an important invasive species in some areas of the Great Plains. The abundant seed production makes it suitable for seeding or sodding. The grass has been used in history for thatching and as swatting in farming and war. The plant has become naturalised in many areas it has not been cultivated. Many cultivar have been selected for different purposes. This grass tolerates a wide range of conditions and is often able to outcompete less hardy species in unfavourable locations. A number of L. perenne accessions have been assigned to.Genomes 1N = 16, 29, 42. It is suggested that the subsp. durum be made a distinct species.",
    "Cynthia Teague (born Cynthia Ann Teague; August 7, 1958 – January 11, 2023) was an American serial killer and sexual sadist who gained notoriety for her 2003 arrest in Texas, where she resided at the time. Her modus operandi was to lure men to their deaths through online personal advertisements, then kill them and, in some cases, skin them alive. Teague was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, whereupon she would have had the death sentence commuted to life in prison. However, she was found dead in her cell on January 2023, apparently having hanged herself. History Cynthia Ann Teague was born on August 7, 1958, in El Dorado, Arkansas, to Jesse Lee Teague and Bernice Ruth Teague (née Pruitt). She had one older half-sister, Gale Bivins, from her mother's prior marriage. Teague was raised in the small rural community of Robin, Arkansas, where she attended public school and began developing an interest in serial killing after reading SERIAL: The Sam Sheppard Case. At age 17, she left home, moving to Houston, Texas. There, she worked as a cocktail waitress and was active in the local heavy metal music scene. Career In 1983, aged 21, Teague began a relationship with Fredrick Clark, a Black Belt-turned-bricklayer. The couple soon moved in together and had two children, a boy and a girl, born in 1984 and 1986, respectively. In 1987, Teague was diagnosed with lupus, a terminal illness for which there was no known cure at the time. This greatly affected her health and emotional state, and caused her to become depressed. On July 28, 1989, Clark traveled to California to attend a family gathering. He was later unable to return home, with Teague's family claiming that he had simply run away. On August 10, Teague's brother spotted Clark's Saturn abandoned in front of a Homewood, Alabama motel, and notified the police. Clark's body, bearing signs of having been shot and tortured, was discovered later that day. The police arrested Teague for the murder, and she later confessed to driving Clark to Alabama in her car. She claimed that Clark had intended to surprise her family but became disoriented in the dark and accidentally drove to Alabama instead. Teague was extradited back to Texas, and on February 7, 1990, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. In order to qualify for the death penalty, a Texas jury needed to find unanimously that the crime was committed \"deliberately and with the intent to cause death\", and that it was \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". The former finding relied on the state of Teague's physical and mental health at the time of the murder, while the latter required the jury to consider Clark's body, with the signs of torture. After more than 30 witnesses testified for the prosecution, Teague was found guilty. She unsuccessfully appealed her conviction to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and on April 19, 1995, her sentence was formally commuted to life imprisonment. Teague has stated that she would have gladly accepted a life sentence had she known that the sentence would have included eligibility for parole after 17 years, though parole was not available to lifers at the time. She was placed in the Gallego-Hoyt Facility in Tennessee, which houses prisoners on death row. Notable incidents Mutilation murder of Charles Fisher On November 1, 2000, Teague lured Charles Fisher, 52, a truck driver, to a secluded location using a personal ad. Once there, she handcuffed, gagged, and blindfolded him, and stabbed him 27 times, slicing open his liver, gallbladder, stomach, and left leg. When the police arrived on the scene, she pretended to be shocked by Fisher's condition and claimed that she did not know him. She was arrested soon afterwards. After her conviction, Teague stated that she had been inspired to kill Fisher after seeing a news report on the television program America's Most Wanted about a man who had been murdered in a similar manner. In September 2001, Teague requested, and was granted, a visit from her children, who were then aged 11 and 9. Following their visit, the children told their grandmother, Teague's mother, that Teague was a \"bad mommy\" who had \"made them sad\". Teague's mother subsequently moved with her daughter to Robin, Arkansas, to try to help her get better and handle her illness. While there, in May 2002, Teague was hospitalized for the third time in two years following a suicide attempt. After her release, she returned to her home in Robin. On September 12, 2002,",

    "The Latest Fashion The latest fashion, launched at London Fashion Week in February, involves shoppers entering stores with their phones and being escorted to dressing rooms by digital agents. The agents, which include artificial intelligence, recommend different items for different body shapes, and can also answer questions about what sizes people wear. The store Arya, in London, has a virtual reality area where customers can try clothes on without leaving the house. This was one of many headlines about the fashion industry in 2020. Concerns were raised about the influence of Amazon on the retail industry, as the company bought Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion and was rumored to be developing a line of fashion products. The temporary hijacking of Twitter accounts by the \"Covid 19 Stitch Program\" was seen as symptomatic of how the fashion industry can become insular and ignore outside perspectives. Other positive stories included London's commitment to sustainability and its commitment to using only vegan leather, and Milan's creativity in responding to the pandemic, with celebrations of fashion's ability to transcend borders. erase \"The Covid 19 Stitch Program\" was hijacked some Twitter accounts of people in the fashion industry. act The Covid 19 Stitch Program The Covid 19 pandemic transformed the fabric of everyday life for most of the world's population.

One controversial decision was the temporary hijacking of some Twitter accounts by the \"Covid 19 Stitch Program\", an initiative coordinated by the fashion house @lefeworld, which saw the @fashchionist, the official account of the fashion industry's mouthpiece @WomensWearDaily as well as other well-known users being stitched to tout the benefits of wearing clothing produced by the industry. The initiative was considered by many to be out of touch with the real world, and people took to the platform to complain and suggest better solutions to the pandemic such as encouraging businesses to reopen and reminding the industry of its impact on the environment.",
    "Zirkle Mill is a historic gristmill located at Zirconia, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1864, and is a 1 1/2-story, banked stone building on a rubblized cement foundation. It is representative of the only two stone gristmills built in Schuylkill County. It was restored in 1950-1952 and operated as a mill until 1977. It was then used as a museum by the Donegal Historical Society until it was restored and reopened in 2004 for public usage. The mill is owned by the Donegal Historical Society and is open to the public. The building is located in the Donegal Historic District. It is believed the stone building was constructed in 1864.

    "Leicester Smyth (born Elizabeth Jones; September 25, 1919 – September 14, 2010) was an African-American singer and actress. She was born into slavery in rural Arkansas and began working in nightclubs as a teenager. Smyth moved to Chicago and signed with MGM Records, where she became the first African American to have a gold record. She also appeared in several films during the 1950s, but later became a school teacher. Smyth's hits include \"Blues in the Night\", \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\", \"Mack the Knife\", and \"When the Lights Go On Again\". Smyth's family history was the subject of the 2002 documentary film Foxfire: Trial of Foxie (renamed to Foxfire: A Girlhood between Two Nations upon its UK release). She died in 2010 at the age of 92. Foxie, which is what she was called as a child, was born in rural Arkansas. She was bought by a local farmer when she was three years old with the intention of utilizing her as a dairy animal. However, the young girl proved to be a very able violinist. Indeed, she was bought by a local bandleader, who took her on as a member, not realizing that she was actually a human being. [...] After serving in the US Navy during World War II, Smyth returned to the studio, where she signed a contract with MGM Records. Smyth went on to achieve success with several hits, including \"Blues in the Night\" (1954), \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" (1956), \"Mack the Knife\" (1956), and \"When the Lights Go On Again\" (1957).",
    "Super column is a type of solid fuel used in rockets, missiles, and torpedoes. In contrast to most solid fuels, Super Columns use a hypergolic mixture of bipropellant in a matrix of silica-china within a thin-walled steel canister. The Columns generate high thrust at relatively low temperatures, permitting more rapid missions and a greater proportion of the vehicle's total thrust available early in the mission. Super Columns were used as a propulsion system in the U.S. space program. In the early years of the Space Race, Super Columns enabled very high altitude flight, sufficient to reach outSpace and beyond. The development of more powerful, reusable launch vehicles eliminated the need for Super Columns by enabling higher velocity for lower cost, but the development of more efficient thermal protection allowed the use of Super Columns for more capable missions, including Earth orbits, cislunar space, and deep space travel. Although never developed for use in manned spacecraft, Super Columns were used in the early testing of launch vehicle components, including the RTG. The first United States military launch using a Super Column was in 1958, and the system was used in many launchings through the 1960s. In 1961, a Redstone rocket with a burning Super Column achieved an altitude of and a velocity of, the highestaltitude andvelocity ever achieved with a solid fuel engine at the time. In the early 1960s, the US Navy started development of the SM-1 Rocketdyne rocket propulsion system, which used a hybrid engine combining a Super Column and a JATO unit. The resulting launch vehicle was designated VLSO, for Vertical Launch Solid Rocket. The first test launch took place in 1962. The first operational launch using VLSO took place in 1964, launching an SM-1 missile with a live warhead off of the USS Lake Champlain.",

    "Nicobar district is a district in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is situated in the western part of the district headquarters district of North Andaman Island. The district comprises two islands (Nicobar and Little Nicobar) and a number of sea cliffs and reefs. The district is administration under Kamorta packing station office. The district has a population of 8,787 according to the 2011 Census of India. The Nicobars comprise the Nicobar island and the Little Nicobar island. The district headquarters are located in Kek physi island. The district is spread over an area of and has a population of 8,787 (as of 2011). The district is administrated by a subdivisional officer, who is assisted by a sub-divisional officer and 23 government servants. Nicobar is called the \"Land of Mermaids\" due to the large number of whales and other marine life found in the surrounding waters. The district is famous for its eight offshore island territories, of which five are inhabited. It was formed as a district on 16 December 2006, carved out of North Andaman district, along with South Andaman district and part of Arrakonam district (which now comprises part of Thoothur District). Kandhamal district was created from a part of Nicobar district on 4 November 2008. The name Nicobar is probably derived from the island's former name, 'Nicobar Islands'. The district is named after the island of Nicobar. The Nicobar district is home to two of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar's administrative divisions — Kamorta and Nancowry. The district has a tropical monsoon climate. With its neighbouring districts of North and South Andaman, Nicobar is included in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, the Union Territory located in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. The Andaman and Nicobar islands were discovered by a British officer, John instance, in 1853. Prior to British occupation, the islands were ruled by the Nicobar king, taking part in an exchange of gifts with Raja Jai Rakheya of Kamorta (now in South Andaman district) and Raja Radhika Mani of Nancowry. After the exchange of gifts, the Andamanese inhabitants referred to the Nicobars as \"Radha\" or \"Raja's sister\". The Indian government declared the islands a district on 16 December 2006, and it was officially inaugurated by then president of India, Abdul Hamid, on 27 December 2006. The island has many tribal population. Nicobar districts has a high density of tribal population. There are two tribal settlements in the Little Nicobar island. Around 90% of the population of the island belong to one of the six tribal groups namely the Mishing, Koch, Dopchong, Jarawas, Sentners and Bawm. They reside mainly in nine tribal communities: Puyuma, Mishing, Koch, Dopchong, Jarawas, and Sentner, though a few Bawm and Nicobarese live in Digliput Tehsil. The remaining population resides in the villages of South Nicobar district, which is not covered under this article. The district is approximately southwest of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is about south-south-east of Kolkatta, east of Chennai, west of Singapore and northeast of Hong Kong. The district is physically separated from the rest of India by the South China Sea, with the nearest land being the Indian territory of Arunachal Pradesh to the north. The district is linked to the Indian mainland by a long causeway, constructed in 10 years, with an average width of 30 metres and a height of 25 metres. The district is the only mainland district in India without a road access and it is only connected to the mainland by sea. The nearest airport is Haddo Airport at Port Blair. A new airport, Neil Anderson Bay Airport, is under construction and is expected to be ready by 2021. The district shares its border with South Andaman district in the north, Arrakonam district in the east, Karaikal district in the south and the Bay of Bengal in the west. The district covers the Nicobar Islands as well as some islands off the coast of the Nicobar Islands. There is a long continuous coastline in the Bay of Bengal. The Andaman and Nicobar islands are surrounded by the Indian ocean to the south and the Malacca straits to the east. The Nicobar islands are south of the equator in the Indian ocean.

    "Heisenberg's microscope was a thought experiment proposed by the German theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg to illustrate the ability of observation to affect the observed. Heisenberg described an apparatus that consisted of a set of lenses and a light source that could be used to observe a quantum entity such as an atom, but the act of observation would change the behavior of the observed such that it was no longer predictable. The example Heisenberg used to illustrate this effect was a microscope that had a microscope objective lens that formed an image of the atoms that were being observed on a screen, but the act of observation by the viewer would cause the atoms to spread out and cover the screen. scheme is still used in modern laser scanning microscopes to demonstrate the indeterminacy at the quantum level, where the wave function of the atom randomly selects which path the atom takes as it \"tunnels\" through the solid matter that makes up the microscope's objective lens. gain more information about this experiment and its use in demonstrations and teaching, see Heisenburg's microscope. recently, the use of an intentionally flawed microscope objective lens was used in a demonstration of how this effect might be used to transmit information between entities that were too far apart for normal communication, in this case, using light transmitted through a solid metal plate as the intermediate carrier. again more information can be found in the Heisenburg's microscope article. again more information can be found in the Heisenburg's microscope article. spread out images perform act of observation cause the wave function to randomly select which path the atom takes might be used to transmit information light transmitted through a solid metal plate transmit information between entities recently Heisenburg's microscope again ago again invention Heisenburg use laser scanning microscopes still used image perform cause transmit information spread out images perform Cause recent again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again",
    "Charles Leander Weed (May 21, 1819 – November 23, 1898) was a career military officer in the United States Army who held various positions in the American West. He led campaigns against the Comanches, Utes, Apaches, and Navajo in New Mexico and Arizona before becoming superintendent of the Mormon Battalion in Utah. Weed performed mapping in California and was one of the first recordedographers in Nevada. Weed is credited with building infrastructure in the early days of the Utah Territory and is remembered by the naming of fortifications in the state. In 1858, Weed was court-martialed for killing one of his soldiers, although he was ultimately acquitted. This event made him infamous in many circles and contributed to his retirement from the military. While most sources consider him a hero in the Mormon Corridor for his service to the Mormon pioneers, others view him as a villain for ordering the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre. Utahns have long disputed his role in the affair, and his name was removed from many public structures in Utah after a 1978 referendum. Historians more broadly agree that there is no clear evidence of Weed's involvement in the massacre, and that his defense could have reasonably relied on the fact that a great many government officials were sometimes terrible at doing their jobs. Weed's service to the Mormon pioneers is generally accepted as genuine, although his record of service is imprecise. Weed's activities have been used to justify the fortifications in Utah, and he is remembered by the street names of Salt Lake City (Weed Avenue), Ogden (Weed Street) and Provo (Weed Boulevard) in addition to numerous placenames in southern Utah and northeastern Nevada. The Utah Senate named a public building in his honor in 1896 but the House of Representatives failed to override the Senate vote and the building was later torn down. The Weed &XXX; Finley house in American Fork, Utah was also named after him. The largest park in Salt Lake City, Weed Memorial Park, is also named after him. The city of Ogden's police station is named the Leander Weed Building. Weed is the namesake of the Leander Weed Nature Preserve in Washington County, Utah and the Leander Weed Natatorium at Brigham Young University. Although several streets are named after Weed in Draper, Utah and American Fork, Utah, he is not particularly memorialized in Salt Lake City where multiple parks and public buildings bear his name but there is no monument or plaque in his honor. Weed is one of the most prominent historical figures in Utah but does not have a street named after him and does not have a statue in his honor. A petition to change this has been submitted twice since 2008 without success. A 2013 biography, Weed: The Man and His Flames, was written by Brad Ricca, who also wrote a children's book about Weed's life, Weed: The Story of a Pioneer Hustler. The Utah-based Weed Family History Foundation was founded in 2016 to preserve and promote research into the family trees of Leander Weed and his descendants.

    "The Vibrating Shuttle was a robotic arm designed to carry objects via electrical stimulation of muscles. It was developed in the late 1970s at the University of California, Berkeley, in the laboratory of Igor B. Kozhevnikov. It was invented as an improvement over existing shuttle robots, which typically employed sequential direct current (DC) motors. The vibrating version used a single DC motor with a large DC offset and patchwork motor drivers to achieve flutter (vibration)mode operation. This made it much more efficient, simple and robust. The on-board hardware and software control made it possible to do innovative things, such as changing the frequency of the flutter mode to compensate for changes in the load, or changing the wave shape.

    "Morgxn (formerly known as Moloch) is a cryptocurrency exchange founded by the company investment fund Novo Holdings. It is based in St. Kitts and launched in August 2020. The platform is differentiated by its commitment to user privacy and confidentiality. Morgxn follows a tokenless exchange model, which relies on smart contracts to enforce trading rules. It claims to never keep user assets on the platform and to use only cold storage for user funds. The company states it will not collect or share personal information with third parties and that it works to guarantee user privacy. To achieve user privacy, Morgxn uses peer-to-peer networking and self-enforcing smart contracts to conceal user transactions from other exchanges and the public blockchain. According to Novo Holdings, Morgxn's approach enables the platform to grow without needing fund reserves or management, relying solely on trading fees. On February 2023, Morgxn was permanently shut down, with users losing access to their assets and funds. Novo Holdings has not made a public statement regarding the closure, but several sources attributed the closure to the lack of basic infrastructure requirements and mismanagement. History August 2020 - Morgxn is founded by Novo Holdings, with the company investment fund as its sole investor. The company states that it will never hold users' assets on the platform, and that it works to guarantee user privacy. February 2023 - Morgxn is closed by the company, with users losing access to their assets and funds.

References Category:Cryptocurrencies<|endoftext|>A modern real-time operating system (RTOS) can effectively isolate one part of the system from another part of the system, providing a high level of modularity. The real-time aspect of an RTOS allows it to guarantee timely processing of certain events, such as to provide NTP (network time protocol) or audio playback with a specific latency bound. Memory management, process management, and device management are other examples of how an RTOS can ensure timely processing of events. The two main classes of RTOSs are structured and unstructured. Structured RTOSs provide a dividing up of tasks into groups or structs, with the schedule determining which struct will perform which task at which time. An example of a structured RTOS is VxWorks, which is used in a wide range of aerospace and military equipment. An example of an unstructured RTOS is Linux, the core component of which is the operating system Linux. While Linux is not widely used in real-time systems, it provides the ability for system programmers to perform the tedious RTP (real-time programming) tasks in an abstract way. Thus, Linux is an unstructured RTOS. A particular class of RTOSs is the resource-constrained RTOS. These systems have highly constrained resources, such as limited memory or processor time. One example of a resource-constrained RTOS is MB Crusade, which is an extension to VxWorks. Another example is ThreadX, which is also an extension to VxWorks. A further example is FreeRTOS, which is a common and lightweight RTOS. VxWorks is an example of an RTOS that is both structured and resource-constrained. Because VxWorks has a struct approach to task management, it is considered to be structured. VxWorks is also constrained in its resources, such that it may not execute a task that exceeds its resources. VxWorks thus satisfies both conditions of being structured and resource-constrained. A specific problem associated with RTOSs is the overhead of context switching. When a task requests a resource, the RTOS checks the tasks queued for the resource to see if another task is currently using the resource. If another task is using the resource, the original task must wait until the other task is done with the resource before its request will be fulfilled. This can create a latency in the management of resources, especially those that are scarce, such as processor cycles and memories. Thus, there is a need to reduce the overhead of context switching in RTOSs. A second problem associated with RTOSs is their incompatibility with application binary interfaces (ABIs). This incompatibility causes the wide proliferation of different RTOS implementations for a specific application. Each RTOS may have its own peculiarities, bugs, and APIs, making it difficult to integrate different RTOS capabilities into a wider system. The proliferation of different RTOS implementations thus raises the cost of development and hinders the extension of RTOS capabilities. Thus, there is a need to allow for a wider system integration of RTOSs. The present invention is directed to addressing, or at",

    "The Glomar Challenger was a submarine owned and operated by the United States government under the terms of a service agreement with the Sea Quest Diving Company. The Challenger saw active service from 1968 until 2013. The vessel was named after the tabletopExploration vehicle used by the United States Navy during the Cold War. The Challenger provides deep-sea rescue and recovery services for items brought to the seafloor by underwater researchers. The vessel also provides maintenance and storage for downlinked scientific equipment and material, as well as support for Undersea Test and Operations facilities (the United States Navy's ocean testing and evaluation division). The Challenger supports operations of the scientific program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The vessel's capabilities, along with a complement of scientists and sailors, made it suitable to serve as a mothership for remote underwater vehicles, including the TENDO III and Wandel II artificial islands. During its operational history, the Challenger carried a diverse range of hardware and equipment for use at sea or on the seafloor, including: hydrophones, scientific sampling devices, diving bells, maritime scientific instruments, anchors, cable testing and repair equipment, communication and navigation equipment, and decompression chambers. On 18 August 2012, the Challenger severely suffered a mishap during a regular dive at a test and evaluation site in the Cayman Trench. The accident led to the loss of power and control of the submarine, which eventually resulted in a collision with a Hydrothermal Vents-associated objectiveASM explorer. The circumstances surrounding the accident are not publicly known, but the United States Department of Transportation's Maritime Safety Administration attributed the collision to the Challenger's \"inability to dive\" and \"lack of control\". Subsequent inspections by the manufacturer determined that the flooding of the stern compartment was due to a failure in the galley sink. Subsequent efforts to return the submarine to the surface were unsuccessful, and the Challenger remained trapped on the seabed. The Challenger rests at a depth of approximately, seven miles (11 km) south of the MarineUM range boundary, near Where U Me, West India. Due to the vessel's ongoing inability to return to the surface, the United States government classified the Challenger as \"decommissioned\". While the United States Coast Guard operates a sea-based rescue capability for the Challenger and its sister vessels, the Sea Robin and the Sirius, under contract to NOAA, officials did not plan for the vessel to be raised or subsequently decommissioned. To date, the vessel remains entombed on the seabed and is in an operational but non-service status.",
    "The Clan, which originally stood for Performance Tech Winged Outfit, was started by Tyler, Tristan, and Malcolm. The clan was originally started as a creative outlet for Tristan and Malcolm, who have no human relations and live their lives on the internet. The Clan became famous in 2022 after Tyler released a tutorial on the internet, teaching anyone how to make a suit similar to his. The tutorial went viral and the Clan became extremely popular. Tyler, who was the youngest member of the clan, began to train the new members of the clan. Throughout the years, the clan evolved into a family, as the members began to develop feelings for each other. In 2025, the clan was attacked by the Subreddit DFLA, who blamed them for the popularity they had gained. The Subreddit ultimately failed, but caused the clan to lose faith in the public and each other. In 2026, the clan decided to take a break from the internet and spend time with each other. However, the break didn't last for too long, as the clan was forced to confront their feelings for each other once again. By 2027, Tyler had completely disappeared, only to resurface a year later in 2028 with a new, radically different mindset. He had become the leader of a religious group known as \"The True Family,\" and held the entire clan under his control. The clan was forced to follow his ways or be cast out of the family forever. In 2029, The Clan was attacked by \"False Family\", another religious group led by Siena, who wanted to take over the world. The members of the clan fought back, but were unsuccessful. The entire clan was subsequently shot down, with only Tristan and Malcolm surviving. After reuniting, the two found a ship full of children, who claimed to be the new generation of The Family. The two believed them at first, but ultimately came to realize they were being lied to. The children were in fact the servants of Siena, who used the children to take over the world. Malcolm and Tristan were able to escape and confront Siena, who confirmed their suspicions and ordered them to fight. After a lengthy battle, the two managed to overpower Siena and destroy her army. Malcolm and Tristan then reunited once more, bringing an end to the clan.",

    "Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans (German: Ferdinand IV. König von der Reichsmacht), popularly known in Germany as Fritz I, was the King of Bavaria and Head of the House of Wittelsbach from 1853 to 1891. He is the only member of the House of Wittelsbach of Bavarian birth who was elected King of the Romans (i.e. Head of the Roman-German (kedjmir modified to German) or German monarchical party) instead of elected King of Bavaria. Born in Munich, the eldest son of King Louis I and his wife, Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt, Ferdinand was first governor of the Bavarian lands on the left bank of the Upper Main River, the Mark Brandenburg, whose capital was Berlin, serving from 1806 to 1810. From 1826 to 1853 he was also Landgrave of Thuringia, a state centered around Weimar, whose capital city was also named Thuringia's state capital. In 1853, at the age of 55, Ferdinand was elected King of the Romans on the condition that he would not leave Bavaria for his residence in Berlin. He accepted this election, though he was fully entitled to refuse it, because the Wittelsbach candidate, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, was seen by the Bavarian parliament as a foreign monarch, in contrast with the election of Ferdinand, who was of Bavarian birth. Ferdinand is known for his liberal policies and his engagement in the German Customs Union and in the German Confederation. He is also the first king who accepted the governmental responsibility in his monarchical state. In this period, his cousin Prince William of Hesse-Kassel was his adviser. Ferdinand's rule is associated with the modernization of Bavaria. He was the first king who rode a bicycle and took the public transportation instead of a carriage. He founded Munich's first public park, Residenzpark, and founded the Munich Conservatory. The Wittelsbach family adopted the wedding ring, allowing the children to become inheritors of their parents' thrones immediately upon their marriages. Ferdinand's rule ended with his death on 7 December 1891 in Munich. He is the last Wittelsbach king of Bavaria and the last king of the Romans elected before the position of King of Bavaria became ceremonial.",

    "The Suquamish Museum is a natural history museum in Suquamish, Washington, United States. It is in a 1906 WPA-Classified building that was designed by John Graham and Harry Barton. The museum has changing exhibits and a large collection of artifacts and biological specimens from local regional tribes. The museum was started in 1953 by Annette Islands and her husband Lawrence Islands, who are both Pisaster ochreadii, or starfish species. The couple began collecting specimens on local beaches as a way to educate local school children about the importance of saving local wildlife. They began holding small informal nature exhibits in their living quarters at a local Catholic church. In 1953 they purchased the building that is now the Suquamish Museum and in 1954 they officially incorporated as the Suquamish Museum. The Suquamish Museum gained fame in 1964 when it loaned several of its most prized exhibits to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. This exposure attracted media attention and attention from sponsors, and several enhancements were made to the facility to accommodate the new crowds. However the museum was unable to continue to fund the operations, and was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1977. The bankruptcy was later converted to a Chapter 11, but the museum was unable to make up the financial shortfall and closed in 1982. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its architectural significance. After being neglected for many years, the building was bought in 2011 by a local developer who renovated the building to re-open it as commercial space, including a Bed, Breakfast, and event space. The museum reopened in 2016 under new ownership. The collection has grown over the years and exhibits a changing selection of tribal art, natural history and works by local and regional artisans. The museum hosts several annual events, including the Mount Rainier Aerial Tram Fest, the Pacific Northwest Folklife Festival and the Indianola Coffee Festival. In the summer of 2021 the museum underwent a major renovation, increasing its exhibit space and creating a new area for temporary exhibits.

    "Joe Grey is a fictional character created by Marjorie Main who also created theurdy Mouse and Timeflies. Joe Grey is a cat of mixed ancestry, who lives in rural Virginia with a human family. He is known for his super power of seeing the future, which he rarely reveals. The character was created in the comic book format first appearing in 1948. The publisher EC was reluctant to create a character who was not a human, as they had created similar characters in the past and received complaints. As a compromise, the name Joe Grey was chosen as an anagram of Joseph Grey, thus creating the first comic book cat. Joe Grey has appeared in many books written by Marjorie Main, as well as being the subject of several animated TV series and several movies. A television series called Highway Masters had Joe Grey as the voice of a cat who worked for the Department of Transportation. Marjorie Main wrote 21 novels about Joe Grey and one additional novel featuring Joe Grey in collaboration with other authors. In 1999 Joe Grey was inducted into the Hollywood Hall of Fame. Joe Grey was also the subject of a Disney Villain Theme Park attraction at the Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. Joe Grey also has his own star on the Starlit World Dome in Los Angeles. Joe Grey is considered to be one of the most popular comic book characters ever created. Joe Grey in other media Marjorie Main created three animated TV series based on Joe Grey's adventures. There have been seven movies based on Joe Grey's adventures, with the most recent being Grey: The Summer Without a Spring, which is a sequel to the 2002 movie Grey mystery movie. The 2001 movie Grey's Anatomy was based on Joe Grey's story, Joe Grey, Mr. McBride and the Hospital Ship.",
    "The Haas VF-18 was a Formula One racing car built by Haas Automation for the 2017 Formula One season. The car was driven by Juan Manuel Correa and Esteban Gutierrez, and was designed by Alan Mann and his staff in collaboration with Haas. The car was driven by the team in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and used by the team as reserve driver James DalBello in the next two rounds of the season, the Chinese and Brazilian Grands Prix. The car was powered by the 2016 Ferrari engine, the same engine that was used by the Sauber team, which was the only other 2016 engine supplier. The car was the first entry by an American team in the modern Formula One World Championship, and was the first open source car built by any Formula One team. The car's best finish was 7th place, achieved by the team and Gutierrez at the Canadian Grand Prix. The car's front wing failure at the European Grand Prix was the first retirement of a car powered by a 2016 Ferrari engine. Despite a promising start to the season, the car was not retained for the 2018 Formula One season. The car is currently on display in the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. Haas VF-18<|endoftext|>After a team of Israeli researchers created the world's first 3D-printed heart, they got some flack for doing so from the media. Many outlets, including CNN, Vox, the Washington Post, and others, reported that the researchers used a 3D printer to make the heart out of polylactic acid, orPLA, a material used to make clear plastic bottles. But not only is PLA nontoxic, it's biocompatible, meaning it won't cause an immune response when implanted into the body. In other words, this is a heart the medical community can get behind. The material was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2022 and is now available for purchase from a few online vendors for a little over $4,000. That's much less than what it would cost to make using traditional manufacturing techniques, and it's a good deal more affordable than what many people would consider paying for a heart today. The idea of printing hearts is not entirely new, but using a 3D printer to make a working heart has never been done before. Though some news outlets inaccurately reported that the heart was made of plastic, it was PLA—a versatile biocompatible polymer used in everything from yogurt containers to kayaks. \"There is nothing magical about PLA,\" 3D Printing Industry magazine wrote. \"PLA is just a strong, versatile polymer that can be used by a wide range of manufacturers.\" It's also renewable and compostable. When disposed of in a landfill, it degrades within a couple of hundred years. So, while the idea of 3D printing entire body parts might make you think of the dystopian movie GATTACA, it's actually the kind of technology we can get behind. And because it's 3D-printed, the manufacturing costs will likely be much lower than they would be for a traditional heart, which could make it a viable option for anyone, no matter their ability to pay. 3D-printed organs have already proven to be a feasible alternative to organ transplants, with several printers now being used around the world to create functioning hearts, kidneys, livers, and even bladders. Because the technology relies on additive manufacturing, it's inherently safer than traditional manufacturing methods, which require a single piece to be made from start to finish, in sequential order. With 3D printing, manufacturers are free to tweak and change components as needed, making it a better choice for customization and personalization—a huge advantage in the medical field. 3D-printed medical components such as catheters, surgical tools, and sutures have been in use for several years, with some products now even available on the market. \"As the medical industry continues to find new uses for additive manufacturing, this breakthrough is another incredible example of how the technology is helping to usher in a new era of patient care,\" 3D Printing Industry wrote of the heart's debut. The printers used to make the heart are already in use in over 50 hospitals and research centers across the world, including the University of Oxford, Northwestern University, and Weizmann Institute. Printing working hearts is the perfect follow-up to 3D-printing a human face in 2015, as both are high-impact, high-profile technologies that advance medical science, even if the technology is still in its early stages. 3D printing can now create parts as small as a human cell, and the industry is projected to reach $480 billion by 2023.

In Europe, frogs are associated with bad luck and women never wear a frog in their hair at a wedding. Ancient Greeks thought frogs generated fire and that's why they were associated with season of spring. Romans though thought frogs were cold and associated them with winter. In modern days, frogs are often used as a symbol of pranks and humor. Hollywood celebrities often wear shirts with a frog on it to a press conference to announce a new movie.

    "Niña de mi corazón is an affectionate nickname given to a category of Mexican mutual Fund, it is named this way because its main investors are children (Niños in Spanish). In modern financial markets, mutual funds that are focused on investment for children are commonly referred to by the name of the main shareholder of these funds, in this case \"Niña de mi corazón\". As of February 2022, the total amount of assets in these funds was approximately 30 billion dollars, this is about one tenth of Mexico's gross domestic product. The financial markets have seen a growing tendency in recent years to have these funds as a first line of investment for children, as they present significant advantages over other types of investment, such as low volatility and tax benefits for the investors, who are often children. Niña de mi corazón has its origins in the 70s in Mexico, but nowadays it is one of the most popular types of investment for children, having been promoted by several countries, such as Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Spain and more. Niña de mi corazón is a double call girl, in that it seeks to attract capital from children in order to help them finance a future of comfort and stability, meanwhile the managers of these funds seek to attract a higher return on their capital than the traditional financial markets, by investing in low-risk instruments. But while the financial markets as a whole have suffered some setbacks in recent years, due to the increased interest of short-term investors for higher returns, the results obtained by Niña de mi corazón have been positive, with significant increases in the value of the assets under management. While many countries still prefer to invest the money of their children in more traditional financial instruments, such as shares or fixed income bonds, in recent years several managers of mutual funds that invest them in low-risk assets have been attracting more and more attention, such as Niña de mi corazón. Even if the main shareholders of these funds are children, the investors should never be considered as minors, as they are in fact investing on their own behalf a substantial part of their money, to be able to use it at a later time to their own discretion. Even though children are usually not mature enough to make decisions of this type independently, they are full-fledged investors and are treated as such by the law, the regulators and the financial markets. Niña de mi corazón is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, all of the profits obtained with the investment of the money of children are reinvested in the growth of the fund, to ensure a positive return on the capital that has been entrusted to its care. As a matter of fact, the results that Niña de mi corazón have been obtaining have been so positive that some of its competitors have been trying to lure investors with higher returns, but these have been unsuccessful, mainly because these funds invest in low-risk assets. Niña de mi corazón is the only mutual fund that is 100% invested in assets that are not participating in the main indices that are promoted by the largest financial groups, such as FICC or FoIIo, these groups manage portfolios with risky assets that are targeted at clients who have a low tolerance for risk. Niña de mi corazón has been attracting investors, not only from Mexico but also from all over the world, thanks to the advertising done on social networks and in newspapers in several countries, and also through investments from families that have more than one member, which can be considered as collaborative investment. The growth and the success of Niña de mi corazón has made it possible to launch similar funds for other investment goals, such as people, families, Long Term Investments and more. In addition to the capital that is invested by children, Niña de mi corazón also attracts foreign investors, which constitute a majority of its main investors, currently the managers of this fund have obtained over $20 billion in investments from families outside of Mexico, which represents a share of about 35% of the fund's total assets. Niña de mi corazón has a team of 20 managers who carry out the investment of the fund, they have an average of 15 years of experience in financial markets, and are responsible for the selection of the assets that will compose the portfolio of the fund, these assets are spread over different asset classes, such as stocks, real estate, fixed income and more, in accordance with a set of rules and indicators that are specific to the fund. The portfolio of the fund must be diversified, that is, it must not have too much of any one type of asset or financial instrument, otherwise there is a high risk of losing money or suffering",

    "Peromyscus (commonly known as deer mice) is a genus of approximately 20 species of small, hop-facing mice with a wide range of habitats. Many species are common residents of woodland areas throughout the Northern Hemisphere, while others are more specialized in habitat or range. Most species are listed as of Least Concern or near-threatened status, but a few are regionally significant pests. Peromyscus spp. are a genus of small, hop-facing mice with a wide range of habitats. The common species are found in North America as specialized habitat species or as regionally significant pests. Species: * Peromyscus maniculatus (the Striped Mouse) is found across much of North and South America, from southern Canada and the United States south to Argentina and Uruguay. It is also found in Mexico and Costa Rica. A. geraldinae, the Arizona Striped Mouse, is endemic to Arizona. * Peromyscus polius (the Deer Mouse) is found in North America from Canada to Mexico and from the northern United States to Guatemala. It is a common and widespread species found in a wide range of habitats including forest edges, brushy areas, shrubland, agricultural areas, suburban areas, and parks. A. p. melanophrys, the Davis Mountain Deer Mouse, is endemic to Davis Mountain Wildlife Refuge in California. * Peromyscus keeni (the Southern Deer Mouse), also known as the Antarctic Deer Mouse, is endemic to Antarctica. The only known population is on islands off the Antarctic coast, within the Antartica-South Americaerve. Etymology: The genus Peromyscus was named by Brooks and Montgomery in 1893. The specific epithet maniculatus means \"little finger,\" referring to the pattern of bands on the mouse's tail.",
    "Schizopygopsis is a genus of bagrid catfish found in the Pearl River, system of South China. The genus contains two species, the Schizopygopsis younghusbandi and the more recently described Schizopygopsis fontinalis. The majority of the species habitat is in fast-flowing, rocky rivers with a demersal lifestyle, hunting bottom-dwelling fishes and invertebrates. The species are of minimal conservation concern. Power Laws - There are a variety of types of power laws, all which can be described by a power law function y = kx^ν, where y is a continuous quantity, x is the independent variable, and ν is the power. The specific values of the powerlaw exponent depend on the type of power law. In statistics and information theory, the power-law distribution (or distribution function) is a distribution (or family of distributions) P(x) ∝ x^-ν for x ≥ 1, which occurs naturally in a wide range of physical, biological, and social phenomena. Different values of the power-law exponent ν can correspond to the same cumulative distribution function F(x), e.g. an exponential distribution and a uniform distribution are both characterized by a value of ν = 1. Power-law distributions or distributions occur in a variety of context where a system's complexity and the lack of system differentiation cause a scalability problem. In these situations, some of the system's aspects have a self-similar pattern of distribution, that is, they follow a power-law pattern. For example, the number of products in an online store, the number of nodes in a random network, the number of citations in a scientific paper, or the size of logs in a computer system can be modeled by a power-law function. Many proposed mechanisms for creating power-law distributions, including the physical growth and optimization of Random Scale Free (RSF) networks and the Exponential Weights Average (EWA) numerical method for solving differential equations, are themselves approximations and do not generate power-laws directly. In general, generating a power-law distribution requires multiple steps of variation, and some form of post-processing. In some cases, \"power-laws\" may be better described by using other functions such as log-normal distributions.",
    "Hispanics and Latinos are the largest ethnic groups in New York. They compose over 40% of the population in New York. The first large-scale migration of Latinos to New York occurred in the 19th century. Puerto Ricanos were the first Latino group to migrate to New York, followed by those from the Dominican Republic and Central America. Since the 1960s large scale migration from Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and other Hispanic and Latino nations has continued making New York the most diverse state in the country. In 2010, Latinos made up 19% of New York's population and over 40% of the city's workforce. New York City is considered the global capital of Latin American culture. Large Mexican and other Latin American communities can also be found in the Hudson Valley region of New York. Cities with large Latin American populations include Mount Kisco, Harrison, East Hanover, Northamton and Poughkeepsie SETS OF HISPANICS AND LATINO New York has had large Hispanic and Latino populations for several reasons. First, many Hispanic and Latino nationalities were the first to move to New York. Second, many of these nationalities stayed in New York after traveling through the United States. This connection lead to settlements of Mexican Americans, Puerto Rican Americans, Dominican Americans, Central American Americans, and other Hispanic and Latino nationalities in the New York metropolitan region. This large number of Hispanics and Latinos has lead to the term \"ethnicity-based forwarding\" where Hispanic or Latino identity becomes the nexus for all social interaction. This has led to large Spanish-speaking populations in various neighborhoods throughout the state. Today, the term \"Latino\" is used as a self-identifier, often referring to a wider group of people from the Spanish-speaking world, including those from Mexico, Central America, and the Dominican Republic, among others. However, many still self-identify as Hispanic or Latino. There is a large community of Mexican and Hispanic culture in the Hudson Valley, particularly in the towns of Mount Kisco, Harrison, East Hanover, Northamton, and Poughkeepsie.",

    "Goldfinger is a fictional character, a deadly international criminal with an exceptional ability to charm everyone he meets. He was created by Ian Fleming, and first appeared in the novel Dr. No. He is famously played by Sean Connery in the most popular versions of Dr. No and the entire series of Goldfinger movies. Dr. No (voiced by David Niven in the movie) was originally a British agent, but he is portrayed as having a fondness for sexual seduction a la James Bond. He is involved in a high-profile international arms smuggling ring with the leader of the ring, Auric Goldfinger, who often uses beautiful women as accessories and leverage. Goldfinger tries to prove that he is greater than the entire British government by kidnapping and Goldlockizing No. 10, the prime minister. Despite Goldfinger's obvious villainy, he is not without some degree of wit. He often calls Dr. No \"old gold\" to Goldfinger's \"new gold\" (a pun on the expression \"old money\" meaning \"sterling\"). He says that his fellow criminals call him \"Goldy\", and that he has given them all medals for their services to him. He also keeps a vicious snake as a pet. Goldfinger's second most famous appearance came in the 1964 movie Goldfinger, which was the first of a series of movies starring Goldfinger and James Bond. Like Dr. No, Goldfinger is a villain in this series, but is a far more complex character than Dr. No. Auric Goldfinger actually turns out to be the real brains behind the entire operation, and his female assistant, Solitaire, is the real power behind the throne. Goldfinger has created an international corporate empire, and he uses his wealth to bribe every government official he can into working for him. The world is now at his mercy, and he is about to succeed in his plan to essentially nuke his entire bank account by stealing the Federal Reserve's \"disk with interest,\" a theoretical equation to unlock all of the world's money, at the United Nations. James Bond, an agent for the Secret Service (C27 in Goldfinger's internal database) is assigned to thwart Goldfinger's plan. Bond discovers that Goldfinger is actually the patsy of a larger plot masterminded by the ever-evil mastermind V ictor Arno, who is a master of camouflage and misdirection. Goldfinger is framed for the theft, and it turns out that the Federal Reserve was already in Arno's control, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. Goldfinger, using his last remaining money to bribe his way out of prison and escape to his private island, plans to seize Auric and Solitaire's main vault in Fort Knox. Bond, with the assistance of an anonymous British contact (thought to be Zorin, the owner of the Fort Knox vault), breaks into Fort Knox and rescues Auric and Solitaire, foiling Goldfinger's plan. Despite Goldfinger's evil plan being thwarted, he still manages to retain his wealth and status. He is subsequently seen in the 1968 film Goldfinger with (what would eventually become) his final starring role in a movie, You Only Live Twice, where he is killed by James Bond's son, Jonathan Bond, at the conclusion of the movie. Auric Goldfinger was played by Sean Connery in Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice. In the other movies in the series, Goldfinger was played by Albert Fennell. Subsequent films have cast Sean Connery in a cameo appearance as \"Old Gold\" (the nickname given to him by Auric Goldfinger). David Niven returned to play Old Gold in the 1974 film Diamonds Are Forever. Described as \"the quintessential Bond villain\" and \"one of the great screen icons of all time\", Auric Goldfinger was played by Roger Moore in the 1980 movie For Never. Timothy Dalton played Goldfinger in the 1993 movie Goldeneye. Other notable actors to play Goldfinger include Stanley Baker, Robert Shaw, and Peter Sellers.",
    "Turning the other cheek is a Christian ethics concept that states that one should not answer violence with violence, but should allow one's assailant to strike first and return good for evil. The concept is based on the scripture Luke 22: 39 \"But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind God's counsel, but human wish.'\" The concept is often described as an essential part of Christian faith, and as a fundamental element of Quakerism, though it is also part of other religions and belief systems. The idea has been portrayed in many artistic works, notably in the Book of Job and the Lord of the Rings. In the former, the devil, Azog, tries to tempt Job with the offer of retaining one's position in life by doing good and justly judging others; in the latter, the orcs, under the leadership of Gollum, are taught to turn the other cheek, and do not attack the Ringwraiths who have entered the forest to take the ring that would enable them to rule Middle-earth. Certain Biblical scholars, notably Thomas Coke, have interpreted the above passage as applying not to a specific context, but rather to all situations, making the concept essentially irrelevant. In its essence, the ethical concept is still an issue of great debate in many Christian denominations. The Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, many Anglicans, and many Protestant denominations, as well as groups such as the Quakers, do not endorse the concept as part of their creeds. Groups within the Christian faith which do support the concept of turning the other cheek include certain groups of the Plymouth Brethren and the Molokans.",

See also Nepal and Spain share numerous issues regarding socio-economic development including awareness about HIV/AIDS and Spanish immigration to Europe through Spain. Related Wikipedia articles Nepal Spain Currently updating... Nepal has maintained its distance from Spain due to issues relating to its former King, Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, who seized power in a military coup in 2001. Gyanendra was deposed by a peace deal that required him to give up his royal titles and pay millions of dollars in restitution to the Nepali people. However, following the agreement, Nepal continued to maintain its relations with Spain, having maintained a good relationship with the previous king, Tribhuwan Bir Bikram Shah, and his government. The peace deal was negotiated by the government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who as a result became increasingly unpopular. After he lost a no-confidence vote in 2004, Deuba was assassinated by his bodyguard in September of that year. King Gyanendra returned to power, appointing Fakir Chandencedhu, a senior member of the royal family, to replace Deuba as prime minister. In the early 2000s, King Gyanendra expressed interest in developing Nepal's tourism sector. Spain responded by opening a trade delegation in Nepal, with a goal of attracting Spanish investors to the country. However, as the Nepalese people learned more about Gyanendra's human-rights violations, the Spanish government was forced to suspend its activities. Following an unsuccessful attempt in 2006 to negotiate with the Nepalese royal family for Gyanendra to abdicate the throne, in 2008 King Gyanendra was indicted by the Tribhuwan court for crimes against humanity. In 2012, he was convicted by the Nepalese court and sentenced to be imprisoned for life. The Spanish Ambassador to Nepal, Ramon F. Campas, expressed dismay at the decision, saying, \"We've had very cordial relations with the former government led by the prime minister and the former king. We do not recognize this decision and we'll continue to support the former government.\" In February 2013, former king Gyanendra was arrested by the Nepalese military, ending his decade-long asylum in India. The government of Nepal issued a statement explaining that he had been charged for murder and abuse of power and that they hoped he would be extradited to India. In India, Gyanendra had been living at the expense of the Indian government, but he was not granted Indian citizenship. He was arrested on the Nepal-India border, where Nepalese officials seized his property. Washiki history of Nepal",

    "The Final Inch is a 1944 British war film directed by Harry Watt and starring George Alexander, David Tomlinson, David Oxley, Irene Handl and Marjorie Rhodes. It is based on the 1940 novel of the same title by Richard Cross, which was later made into a play and a television film. The film takes its name from the closing stages of the Battle of Morogoro, during which Lord Dunmore's Boys, an African unit of the British Army, aided by Congolese auxiliaries, drove the German army to the edge of capture in Mozambique. It was made at Begbroke Studioseque in Surrey and locations in the Thames Valley, and involved some of the crew from documentary filmmaker Glyn Davis's unit, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB). The Final Inch was intended to encourage public support for the EMB's work to publicize the British Empire and encourage donations to its funds. The Hollywood studios were wary of producing it for war propaganda because of its high cost and the negative reaction of the American public to the bombings of civilian populations in Germany during World War II, so EMB spent half a million dollars on its production. Its release was postponed several times, and its cheerful message was more relevant to Britain's domestic scene than to its war effort, although the message of the film, and of the book from which it was adapted, remained controversial long afterwards. Despite this, the film was well received by critics and had a successful release in the United States, Canada and other British colonies. It received an Academy Award for Best British Feature Film, the only film submitted by the Empire Marketing Board to receive an Oscar award. The cast included David Tomlinson (who had played Carpentier in Gone Are All My Relations) and Anthony Nicholls, who went on to play Minoru in the films of the James Bond franchise.",

    "Lo fiolairé is a songbird species in the family Muscicapidae. It is found in forests from Mexico to northern South America. The scientific name commemorates the French botanist Charles Louis L′orientier. Male and female fiolairé song differently. The male's song is made of sequences of 2 to 6 notes, sung in phrases of 3 to 6 phrases. The phrases begin usually with a 2 second long introductory note followed by the main motif, which lasts 3 to 6 notes long. The introductory note is higher in frequency than the main motif. The female's song is a warble, usually 4 to 8 notes long, sung in phrases of 4 to 7 phrases, also with an introductory note higher in frequency than the main motif. The fiolairé is a host to the tzeltal, zarna, and canario viruses, the last of which is lethal to the birds. The Song Sparrow is a common name for this bird. The fiolairé is evaluated as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. The population is declining, mainly due to loss and degradation of its natural habitat.

    "Polyhedral map projection are a class of map projections introduced in 1884 by Eugenio Beltrami. They are a special case of more general polyhedral cylindrical projections, in which the \"base\" is a polyhedron. The most common examples are the northern and equatorial projections, which project the earth onto a cylinder with a circular base and an axis of the equator, and a rectangle, respectively. Other examples are the Atlam Empross, which projects the earth onto a cylinder with a circular base and an axis of the prime meridian, and the Robinson projection, which projects the earth onto a cylinder with a rectangular base, an axis of the prime meridian, and a central pole. Another well-known polyhedral projection is the mollweide, which is based on a sphere with north and south pole as base. Using the corresponding central projectionparameters, the projection covers the entire earth and at the same time has less distortions in the middle and at the edges of the projection than for example the equatorial projection. For a given central projection parameter, the associated polyhedral projection depends on the angle of rotation, which specifies the orientation of the polyhedron. The following angles are common: north (0 degrees), east (30 degrees), south (60 degrees), and west (90 degrees). The list of polyhedral map projections currently contains the following members: - North- equator projection - Equator- projeciton - Robinson projection - Atlam Empross - Mollweide - Robinson Cylindrical - North- equator- cylindrical - Robinson- cylindrical - Atlam Empross-cylindrical - South- equator-cylindrical - South- Robinson-cylindrical - South- Atlam Empross-cylindrical The parameters of the projection and the corresponding formulas for transformation of coordinates are available from the website of the Swiss Federal Cartography Institute (IGE). Note that the list is not exhaustive and that there are many other projects dealing with non-central projection parameters.",

    "Everybody Wants to Rule the World Wikipedia is a web based multilingual encyclopedia project that anybody can edit. As of April 6th 2023 the Everybody Wants to Rule the World article has been edited 9,426 times by 43 different users (i.e. contributors). The article currently has 11 sections, or categories, which are: Anniversaries Background Credits and distribution Description Editorial conflicts Endorsements Festivals and awards Fictional portrayals Glossary License Meaning in Irish and Gaelic Ongoing disputes The main header is Ongoing disputes which includes sections like Editorial conflicts and License. The ongoing disputes section covers a wide range of topics from Wikipedia being criticized for allegedly failing to represent the contributions of women and minority groups to the various governments actions to suppress freedom of speech on the website. The sections covered by the main header of Ongoing disputes give an indication of the overall scope of the article. Despite its very long title theEverybody Wants to Rule the World’ article focuses on human motivations and conflicts rather than politics and the governance of countries. The opening paragraph states that \"Much of human interaction can be understood through economics, psychology and sociology\" which forms the basis of the article’s central theme of human behavior and motivation. The article takes the position that while people might claim to want specific things such as \"world peace\" or \"to be rich\", human behavior is usually the result of complex and competing motivations, many of which are never fulfilled. For example the Everybody Wants to Rule the World article mentions the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) at least twice. North Korea is an example of a government that people claim they want to rule the world but in fact does not want to rule the world as it does not have the means to do so. However it is also referenced as part of a larger discussion on the psychology of narcissism and self-deception. Another section that mentions at least two countries is Background which discusses the United States and China as opposed to being neutral with respect to any particular country. The United States is discussed in the context of its size, military power and influence on the world stage. China’s role in the 2019–2030 Taiwan presidential elections are also discussed as an example of local issues getting in the way of world affairs. The article’s scope extends beyond political topics. One section that discusses the meaning of the Irish language is Glossary since almost none of the English words have an Irish equivalent. A separate section called Festivals and awards has been created for theNOW magazine award which is described as \"the Oscars of porn\" and has previously been nominated for and won the XBIZ award for the “best adult entertainment award” every year since its establishment in 2005. The article’s broad scope means that it is not specific to any particular time period or geographical location, this makes it of interest to a wide range of people with an interest in human behavior and the world in which we live.",
    "The Rage in Placid Lake is a short science fiction horror story written by Stephen King, originally published in the 1974 edition of The1975 volume of The Mist Decade, an annual series of stories and tales edited by Stephen King. It has since been reprinted in King's collection Full Fantasy Tales, in an abridged form, and in anthologies. Set in Maine, the story follows the events of a local man, Walter Dabney, who, in an attempt to murder his wife Ethel, accidentally kills her best friend Gertrude, and then begins to experience a strange rage which transforms him into a monster. As the rage consumes him, he begins to murder other people and eventually himself. The local police are baffled by the seemingly senseless nature of the killings, and Gertrude's sister Carol believes that Walter is experiencing locatory visitations from his wife's ghost. Despite its length, The Rage in Placid Lake has garnered mixed critical response, with many disliking the perceived implausibility of the rage-like transformations, although others have praised the combination of horror and science fiction themes. The story has been adapted into a low-budget film, released direct-to-video in 1983, and three television adaptations have been broadcast, the first in 1993 on an American television channel and the following two on Starz and Netflix respectively. 797 The Rage in Placid Lake is a science fiction horror short story written by Stephen King, originally published in the 1974 edition of The1975 volume of The Mist Decade, an annual series of stories and tales edited by Stephen King.",

    "The Sound of Missing You is a popular song by American R&B group Boyz II Men from their album II. The song became a top 10 hit in Australia and was the group's second top 10 hit in the US, peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's popular chorus, which features lead singer Shawn Stockman singing the lyrics \"I heard the sound of missing you, and it made me miss you so\" has been described as one of the group's biggest hits. The song was written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The music video features Boyz II Men wearing stereotypical 1980s raver clothing and performing the song in a large warehouse. The video was heavily disliked by critics and was considered a low point in the group's career. The single was commercially successful, becoming the group's second top 10 hit in the United States. The song was followed by a 1994 re-release titled \"The Sound of Love (1996 re-release)\". The song was covered by the American band The Bangles and featured in their 2005 compilation album It's Time for a Change. The song was covered by the German singer Helene Fischer and released as a single in 2014. The song was a top 10 hit in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. A remixer named KOTSI released a techno version of the song in 2001, titled \"The Sound of Missing You (KOTSI version)\". Shawn Stockman proposed to his girlfriend during a live performance of the song in 1986. Boyz II Men members were initially uncomfortable with the lead singer Shawn Stockman being the focus of the song's promotional material, and the group refrained from performing the song live for several years. Boyz II Men would later perform the song on the US syndicated series The Drew Carey Show and on the Family Channel series 3PLA2DOS. Boyz II Men became famous in the 1980s as part of the R&B group the \"Boyz\" and have remained popular ever since. Shawn Stockman became the group's lead singer in 1984. Boyz II Men's second studio album, II, was released in December 1986 and debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album went on to become the group's best-selling studio album, eventually being certified 9x platinum in the US. The album's third single, \"I'll Make Love to You\", was their first top 10 hit in the US, peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Boyz II Men released their fourth studio album, […], in February 1991. The album spawned the top 10 hit \"Enjoy the Silence\" and went on to be certified platinum in the US, selling over a million copies. The group went on hiatus from 1994 to 1997, during which Shawn Stockman released a solo album, I'm Here, which went unnoticed. The group returned with the single \"Yakety Yak\", which did not fare as well as their previous singles, peaking at #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The group was dropped from their record label and subsequently disbanded in 1998. The group reunited in 2016 for the 30th anniversary of the release of their debut single \"I'll Make Love to You\". The reunion was short-lived as they again split up in 2018. Boyz II Men were awarded five Grammy Awards in their career, including Best Pop Vocal Group and Record of the Year for \"I'll Make Love to You\". The group received additional nominations in the categories of Best New Artist, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Album of the Year for II.",
    "Sydney lockout laws are laws in the city of Sydney, Australia that affect the operation of nightclubs and alcohol in general. First enacted in 2002, the laws have been amended several times, most recently in 2015. The laws resulted from a coroner's report into the fires that broke out in the City from the opening of a nightclub on New Year's Eve 1999. The report cited the danger of \"...overly restrictive licensing laws that caused the festival to end earlier than usual on the New Year's Eve in question, resulting in crowds continuing to play the traditional game of 'champagne' in the streets outside the licensed premises\" as a contributing factor to the disaster. The report concluded that the licensing laws needed to be \"reasonable and moderate\". The current laws, which were introduced in 2015, see alcohol availability restricted to 11PM on weekdays and 12AM on weekends, require venue to close at 3AM except for private functions with no more than 500 attendees, and ban on liquor promotions such as happy hours and late night openings. memorably, the laws resulted in an extended period of cultural openness and appreciation in the Sydney nightclub scene, with many of the original clubs – such as the infamous Sydney Rooftop – re-opening and showcasing some of the most famous Australian musicians of the 2000s and 2010s, such as MARION CONCERTINA. The laws have also been criticised for being vaguely worded, with many complaiants that say they violated the law but did not actually do so, and a long tail of court cases challenging the legality of particular instances of venue closure.",

It is served by lines going in every direction: regional and long-distance trains run to Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Düsseldorf, and elsewhere. Freight traffic is handled through the Wuppertal im Odenholze station, five kilometers away. The Hauptbahnhof is a landmark and an architectural achievement of remarkable beauty. Its German design style includes neoclassical and Jugendstil elements and its center dome, added in 1901, is Germany's second largest. The first part of the name, \"Wuppertal\", refers to the old market town founded in 1188. It is located in the Lower Rhine region and was a key economic centre from the middle of the 19th century on. In 1858, the main station was opened in the central business district designed by the architect Arnold Poemel. The construction was financed by a local industrialist, Hugo Schulz. Since the 1990s, Wuppertal is considered the \"Ei (corn) Capitol of the World\" because of the large number of producers of this healthy product, which has made it a well-known European location. The Hauptbahnhof is a landmark and an architectural achievement of remarkable beauty. Its German design style includes neoclassical and Jugendstil elements and its center dome, added in 1901, is Germany's second largest.

    "The 1935–36 New York Rangers season was the first and only season of the New York Rangers in the National Hockey League (NHL). The team finished last in the American Division with only 19 wins in 54 games. Franchise history The New York Rangers were one of six franchises that started playing in the NHL in 1917. The team have won four Stanley Cup championships, in 1930, 1934, 1937, and 1941. The franchise has the second-most wins in league history, with 1,050. The team's first game was a 4–3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. The franchise was founded in Madison Square Garden. The Rangers moved to St. Louis in 1921, Washington in 1974, and New York (East Rutherford) in 2012. In 1934, the Rangers set the NHL record for the longest winning streak at 20 games. The team has seen great success in the early decades of the franchise, but since the 1980s the team has been among the weakest in the NHL, rarely qualifying for the playoffs. Between 1981 and 2013, the team missed the playoffs for 20 consecutive seasons. In 2013, the New York Rangers moved back to New York City after a 59-year absence.

The team set a record for the longest winning streak at 16 consecutive wins, however, the team underperformed and missed the playoffs for the 20th consecutive season.",
    "Proto-Afroasiatic language\" is the term invented in 1952 by Robert H. Schaller and Ivan Vladislavovitch Djordjevic to refer to the hypothetical proto-language from which all other Afroasiatic languages descend. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is commonly conceived of as having arisen in the vicinity of the Middle East some time during the 3rd millennium BC, and to have split into the historically attested Afro-Asiatic and Iranian languages around the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. Afroasiatic is a branch of the larger Semitic language family. It is spoken in a large area from western Saudi Arabia and Yemen to North India and the Iranian plateau. The roots of the Afroasiatic languages are found in the Northwest Semitic language, which is closely related to the Egyptian and Assyrian languages. The oldest attested Afroasiatic language, Kussala, is spoken in the Nile Valley and belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family. The Ochre Language is also Nilo-Saharan, but is unknown as to whether it is the closest living relative of Kussala or whether the two are unrelated and the inclusion of Ochre in the Afroasiatic language family is a result of language contact. All other attested Afroasiatic languages havefinite verbs and are rooted in the Middle East, with the exception of old varieties of Arabic, which are not verb-final. These varieties are most likely stemming from contact with non-Afroasiatic languages of the area, such as various Indo-European languages. The area of Proto-Afroasiatic language has been a matter of debate among scholars. Older models situated it in the Middle East, in an area stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile, including the upper reaches of the Tigris and in the area of modern-day Mesopotamia. This model has been challenged with increasing frequency in recent years, with various researchers proposing distributions in Central Asia, the Iranian plateau, the Horn of Africa, or even into Europe. Although the exact relationship between Proto-Afroasiatic and other branches of Afroasiatic is uncertain, the commonalities among the languages belonging to this branch are substantial. Commonalities in grammatical features, especially in verb morphology, are strong evidence of a genetic relationship. The majority of the terms for body parts in Afroasiatic are also common to other Afroasiatic languages, and etymological connections have been discovered between several of the terms. Despite these similarities, there are also numerous sound changes that are peculiar to Afroasiatic or even to individual languages within it. Among the most notable of these are the loss of final consonants (resulting in words like ox and moth rather than *ox and *moth), the widespread change of consonant clusters into vowel-initial words (resulting in words like *mada as compared to adam), and the development of a special reflex of the root as the basic word form (as in the verb stem becoming the noun verb agreement inflections). These features have led to the view that Afroasiatic is not a single language family, but rather a divergent Sprachbund within a more broadly defined Afro-Asiatic family. The relationship between Afroasiatic and other branches of Afro-Asiatic has also long been a matter of debate. The relationship was once described as forming the so-called \"Hamito-Semitic\" branch within Afro-Asiatic, alongside the close North Semitic language branch and the divergent Afroasiatic branch. This relationship was later found to be unconvincing, and the \"Hamito-Semitic\" branch was split into two with the separation of the NuwenTx- Group into its own branch. The Afroasiatic branch is now conventionally grouped together with the other Semitic languages, leaving the genetic relationship between Afroasiatic and other branches of Afro-Asiatic unestablished. The PAA language has given rise to all other Afroasiatic languages except, possibly, for HarakatMoaban, a language isolate spoken in the Western Sahara. The term Proto-Afroasiatic is not internationally recognized and its definition has not been fixed; it is used only informally by linguists. Most scholars now consider it sufficient to refer to Afroasiatic as a branch of the larger Semitic language family. The following are the most up-to-date proposals for the area of the Proto-Afroasiatic language: * the Fertile Crescent from the Euphrates to the Nile * the Central Asian land between the Oxus and Jumna rivers * the southern",
    "Edward Schalle took the name King of the Street Cleaners after he became the mayor of New York's Department of Streetcleaners in the late 19th century. He was one of the first employees of the department and rose to the rank of supervisor. During his time the department was given an enema of money and manpower to clean the city and Schalle was a major proponent of the streetcleaners power was used for more than just picking up garbage. It was a message that the streets of New York were not clean and needed to be looked after. It was during his time as mayor that he came up with the name \"King of the Street Cleaners\" and started a street cleaning competition that was well covered by the press and a popular competition that has continued to this day. Schalle died in 1919 and his legacy continued with his son Edward Schalle, Jr. taking over the mayorship after his father's death. The current mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, is a third generation Schalle and has promised to keep the family legacy of street cleaning alive.

    "Systems pharmacology is an integrative approach to pharmacology that applies system dynamics and network analysis to understand drug actions at the whole body, organ, and molecular levels. It uses mathematical and computational modelling to build representation of drug actions and processes, and evaluate these models using systems thinking principles and methods, such as system design, system analysis, and system simulation. Using this approach, one can identify system-level properties of drug actions and responses, interactions among drugs and with other medical interventions, and potential adverse drug events. Drug development can be understood as the process of discovery to identify compounds that produce specific effects, and systems pharmacology allows one to identify the drug candidates with system-level properties to best suit the therapeutic needs of an individual patient and population. The application of systems pharmacology has been shown to aid in drug repurposing, for instance to identify drug candidates with previously unrecognized activities to treat new indications, to reduce drug attrition rates in clinical development by targeting suitable indications early in the development process, and to optimize the use of existing drugs for the treatment of complex disorders such as hypertension. Systems pharmacology has also been used to inform drug safety evaluations, for instance to reduce the need for animal experiments by identifying the molecular and cellular pathways involved in drug actions, and to better target early signals of toxicity by better understanding interactions between drugs and other medications. The field is being developed as an international initiative led by the University of Oxford and INSERM, in partnership with Eisai, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis and Astellas Pharma.",

    "Garden designer is a an artistic occupation involving the creation of beautiful parks, gardens and buildings that are designed to be used and enjoyed by all audiences including families with young children and the elderly. Modern garden designers create spaces that are accessible to all, using natural materials and styles that incorporate natural planting and styling to create a variety of different looks and settings. Natural materials and styles that incorporate natural planting and styling are the key to creating spaces that are accessible to all and reflect the personalities of the designers while also being beautiful and environmentally responsible. An example of this is the West Market building in Denver, Colorado designed by Denver-based firm NBBJ. This post-modern building was designed with elements that reference buildings and landscapes throughout Colorado's history, using locally sourced materials and natural features to create a building that is naturally beautiful and a landmark for the city. Natural planting and styling is used throughout the building to provide lush green spaces and plant tanks throughout the building. These green spaces are not only beautiful but also are used as natural air conditioning and provide many opportunities for Colorado families to enjoy nature together. Many of the walls in the building are made of glass, allowing natural light to fill the building throughout the day and at night providing stunning views of the city. Natural materials and styles are not only beautiful and reflect a building's designer but are also better for the environment. In Colorado, we have some of the sunniest and most variable weather in the world which means the use of naturally occurring vegetation and structures that allow for the vegetation to naturally grow is vital to the building's design. By incorporating nature into buildings we not only create healthier environments for people to live and work in but we also improve our views and access to nature for people of all ages. Natural materials and styling used in garden designer design has become increasingly popular as people are seeking a more fulfilling and fulfilling connection with nature. This connection allows people to slow down and relax in nature, reduce the noise in their lives and connect with other people in a more personal way. Garden designer designed spaces help to create this connection by incorporating natural elements into the spaces that help people connect with nature and the outdoors while providing the flexibility for people of all ages to enjoy the spaces. Denver's GreenSpace, a public park within the building's grounds, is a great example of how a garden designer designed park can create a connection with nature while providing people with a place for recreation and relaxation. The park is fully integrated into the building's landscaping and uses vegetation and structures naturally found in the park to achieve the correct setting and design for the space. The GreenSpace contains many engaging and thoughtful spaces including a wildflower garden, bee garden, tree house, butterfly garden and walking trails. The park also includes a variety of recreational opportunities including a swimming pool, children's spray ground and tennis courts. The park's design includes both active and passive elements that allow people to enjoy nature and the outdoors while also relaxing in the park's green spaces. Many of the areas are surrounded by natural plantings and structures that allow for people to experience calmness and peace in the midst of the city. The park also includes several structures and elements that naturally found in trees allowing people to connect with nature from a higher vantage point while experiencing nature from a unique perspective. The park is not perfect and can still use improvements, however, it is one of the most advanced and well-designed garden designer designed parks in the world. The West Market building is an important part of the history and culture of Denver and helps to create a more fulfilling connection between people and nature by incorporating natural elements into the building's design. The building not only helped attract new businesses to Denver but has become an iconic part of the history and culture of the city. The use of natural materials and styles in building design is vital to creating a culture of natural connection in our cities and towns. This culture of natural connection will not only improve our physical health but will also provide us with a more fulfilling and fulfilling connection with nature. Natural materials and styling used in garden designer design has become increasingly popular as people are seeking a more fulfilling and fulfilling connection with nature.

He was born in Nyack, New York and attended the public schools. He was a coachman and foreman for a wagon and carriage factory and later worked at a feed and grain store. He was a clerk in a dry goods store and later opened his own general store. In 1868, he went to Kansas and later returned and operated a livery and carriage stable in Manhattan. He was active in the Tammany Hall organization of New York City and served as a delegate to the New York State Assembly in 1866 and 1867. He was a member of the New York State Senate (7th D.) in 1870 and 1871. He was a member of the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1875 and 1876. He was elected as a Republican to the Forty-second and Forty-third Congresses (March 4, 1871 – March 3, 1875). In Congress, he opposed wholesale municipal bankruptcies and favored a revision of the nation's bankruptcy laws. He was the chief promoter of the legislation to establish the National Free Reloading Firearms Company. He also introduced a bill to establish the U.S. Forest Service. He retired from Congress in 1875 and was appointed on the New York Supreme Court, but did not serve, after being elected Mayor of New York City in 1876. During his mayoral campaign, Royce stressed how he would \"save the city hundreds of thousands of dollars by cancelling needed city services and contracts\" and that \"he would oppose all public and private debt\". In office, his fiscally conservative policies led the New York Times to proclaim Royce the \"champion of good government in New York\". He improved the city's business climate by increasing the number of streetcars, by lowering taxes and by attracting business to the city. In 1881, the Board of Aldermen created the Office of the City Collector in his honor. In 1886, the United States Post Office issued a series of postage stamps in his honor. After leaving office, Royce continued to promote good governance in New York by writing a \"how-to\" book on municipal electioneering entitled Municipal Elections In Detail, with Forms (1886), which was printed in 1887 with a second edition following in 1894. Royce died in 1898 in New York City and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.",

    "The Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests is a forest region in Southeast Asia roughly covering the regions of Mizoram, Manipur, and Kachin states in India, as well as parts of Burma and Thailand. The region is part of the Sunda Shelf floral kingdom, and is located at the intersection of two major biogeographic zones, the Indomalaya and Australasian. The region is notable for its large protected area network, including many Reserves of India, Thailand, and Burma, as well as international protected areas such as the Royal Manipur State Forest Reserve, the SirajDaw Narhill Range National Park, and the Khimiyampui Special Reserve. The forests have diverse flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity of the region makes it a hotspot for research and conservation. The climate of the region is moist and tropical, with large variations in temperature. The Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, together with the larger Central Indo-Burma Plain forests and Eastern Indo-Chinese forests, form the great tropical rainforest belt of Asia. It is considered that large areas of the region were heavily forested until the 20th century, but deforestation has been extremely high in the past 50 years. This is due to efforts at clearance for agriculture and settlements, coupled with high rates of secondary forestation. The region is also subject to logging by illicit wood traders. Illegal logging has been connected to malaria outbreaks in Manipur, and the rising deforestation has contributed to flooding in Thailand. Some argue that large swathes of the region should be given greater autonomy as states, in order to better protect the forests and the environmental issues surrounding them. The area is of global significance for wildlife and biodiversity. It is also considered a crucial element in the development of the region, providing timber, non-timber forest products, and other materials for the local populations. The region is party to the Nagaland peace accord, the Manipur peace accord, and the Kachin peace accord, alongside other agreements relating to immigration, coordination, and security. Due to its protected area network, the region has been labelled a 'green wonderland'. It has also been described as one of the most beautiful and bio-diverse regions in Southeast Asia. Mizoram, Manipur and Kachin are states in Northeast India that form part of the greater region of Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests. Thailand, Burma and India lie adjacent to the region.

    "The Big 5 is a popular set of five megafauna (large animal) species that are prominent targets of organized hunting in Africa. The list includes the lion (lion killing is legal in many countries), leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and lemur. It is most commonly encountered in western Africa where these species co-exist. While there are six officially listed, many hunting organizations and independent researchers maintain a private list of nine (elephant, leopard, lemur, rhinoceros, lion, cape buffalo, and okapi). The number \"9\" is sometimes appended to make a total of 10. The list was developed to promote sustainable hunting and raise money for conservation. Scoring an elephant or lemur is rare, whereas Lion and leopard are highly territorial and relatively easier to hunt. Rhinoceros and elephant can be very dangerous, with the elephant especially difficult to hunt as it is the largest land mammal and a key herbivore, giving it numerous areas to cover. Rhinoceros are frequently killed by charging enraged lions. The most dangerous species is, without a doubt, the lion, as it is the apex predator and responsible for killing and eating most other species. While there are scores of lion in many prides, the lion population as a whole is quite healthy. The term \"Big 5\" has been criticized by animal rights groups and some conservationists who argue that the inclusion of rhinoceros and elephant as part of this list is inappropriate as both species are mainly threatened by habitat loss and not direct hunting. The Royal Bushmen of South Africa have been known to hunt all the species on this list using traditional weapons and successfully protected their population in the past.",

    "Sara Bareilles song \"She Used to Be Mine\" describes a relationship that ended between two parties, where the one party may still feel some mild attachment to the other. The lyrics include features like shared past experiences and expectations for the future. The song was written with the intention of addressing issues like these in a positive light. The chorus of the song is \"But now I'm happy being single / And I blame it all on you\". The implication is that the ex-relationship was bad, and that the current partner is good. However, the former partner shares some of the responsibility for the ending of the relationship, as they did something to push the other party away. The lyrics include the line \"You knew exactly how I felt, but you let it linger / And it's not like I didn't try, but you avoided me\". The implication here is that the current partner was unhappy with the relationship, and that the other partner could have ended the relationship if they had made a direct request. However, the other party is also partially at fault, as the lyrics go on to say \"But now I'm happy being single / And I blame it all on you\". This song has been included on multiple \"Top 10 Relationship Anthems\" lists. The idea that you can focus on the positive aspects of an ending relationship, while absolving the other party for any responsibility, has been cited as a positive takeaway message from this song. Note: this song was written and produced with the intention of having a positive impact on people who have experienced relationship ending pain. The lyric \"But now I'm happy being single / And I blame it all on you\" is not appropriate for every person who has experienced relationship ending pain. For some people, experiencing relationship ending pain means that they were not able to be single, they needed to experience a period of time where they were not thinking about the relationship in order to recover from it. For other people, the blame for the ending of the relationship should not fall on the other party, and the lyrics \"But now I'm happy being single / And I blame it all on you\" could be interpreted as making light of relationship ending pain, which is not the point of the song for these people. The Wikipedia article \"She Used to Be Mine (Sara Bareilles song)\" should describe the impact that this song has had on the fan community, as well as the limitations of the message in the song. The article should also describe the different ways that different people experience relationship ending pain, and how the message of this song does not apply to everyone.

    "Pope Francis' inauguration, the ceremony in which the new pope is formally declared leader of the Catholic Church, took place on February 21, 2013 in St. Peter's Basilica. The ceremony was led by Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, and President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People, and the archbishops of Rome and New York. Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is the first Latin American and the first Jesuit to be elected pope. He is the first non-European and the first Jesuit to be elected pope. Bergoglio is the third pope to be born after the 2nd century and the first to be born in the 20th century. He is the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1414. He is the first pope to visit Israel and the first Latin American pope. The choice of St. Peter's Basilica for the ceremony was regarded as a sign of continuity with the previous popes, as the Basilica is where the seat of Peter was founded and where, according to tradition, the keys of the Church of the Kingdom of God are preserved. The election of Francis had a strong reaction in the world of Catholicism, as well as in the secular world, being described as a \"Wow!\" moment for the Church. The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano wrote that \"The cardinals, bishops, religious superiors, diplomats and representatives of the public health care and social aid sectors, who filled St. Peter's Basilica to overflowing, greeted the new pope with acclaim and emotion.\"",
    "Ursuline Academy (New Orleans) is a private, all-girls school in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is located in the Upper Ninth Ward and is the oldest Catholic School in the city. The Academy was founded by the Ursuline Sisters of Mount Carmel and has educated New Orleanians of all backgrounds since 1824. Ursuline Academy, founded in 1824, is the oldest Catholic school in New Orleans and the only all-girls school in the city. The Ursuline Sisters of Mount Carmel operated the Academy until they were disbanded by the Vatican in 2005. The school moved to its current location, a former church on St. Claude Avenue, in 2016. The campus offers both elementary and middle school levels, with an academy for higher education. While the Ursuline Academy occupies a historic building on St. Claude Avenue, it has fallen into disrepair and been threatened with demolition. In 2017, a group of alumni and donors raised $15 million to acquire the school and surrounding property, with the intention of renovating the facility and keeping the school open. In 2020, Ursuline Academy was ranked No. 2 on Newsweek's list of the top Catholic high schools in America. The Ursuline Academy shares a campus with the Ursuline Academy High School, which is attended by middle and high school boys. The Ursuline Academy also operates Ursuline Academy for Young Women, a coeducational secondary school that occupies a separate campus. In 2005, the Ursuline Sisters of Mount Carmel were disbanded by the Vatican and the Ursuline Academy was forced to close. Its campus was sold to develop the New Orleans East neighborhood. While Ursuline Academy educated many of New Orleans' leaders, including two Chief Justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court, the school was unable to withstand the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The campus was significantly damaged and the school lost many of its core teachers and administrators. The Academy's accreditation was placed in doubt and the school had to reduce its coursework. In 2017, a group of alumni and donors acquired the school building from the Archdiocese of New Orleans and set about fundraising to renovate the campus and reopen the school the following year. In 2019, Ursuline Academy was ranked No. 2 on Newsweek's list of the top Catholic high schools in America. The Ursuline Academy has offered preparatory and college-preparatory education for over 150 years and has graduated notable alumnae, including several Rhodes Scholars and two US Supreme Court Justices. The Academy is the only all-girls Catholic school in New Orleans and one of the top-ranked private schools in Louisiana. The school is unique in its racial and cultural diversity: according to an alumni survey, over 98% of Ursuline Academy graduates are either Caucasian or African-American. The Ursuline Sisters of Mount Carmel originally founded the school for African-American girls, and most of the Academy's current students are from low-income backgrounds. Ursuline Academy's coeducational affiliate, Ursuline Academy for Young Women, is overseen by a separate board of directors. It has a separate campus and does not share facilities or teachers with Ursuline Academy. The school colors are purple and white and the student newspaper is The Titanic. The school marching band has performed for U.S. presidents at the White House. The Ursuline Sisters of Mount Carmel originally founded the school in 1824. The current building was constructed in 1866. The Academy's seal was created in 1867. In 2023, Ursuline Academy was listed as a Peace Education honor school. Visit the Ursuline Academy website",

    "Tanu Muino (formerly known as Tanumim cochlear implant) is a device worn in the inner ear that bypasses the outer ear, auditory nerve and middle ear, and delivers sound directly to the hearing impaired person's cochlear nerve, thus making it possible for the hearing impaired to hear. The TanuMuon device was developed by a Finnish company, Oticon, and was made available for clinical use in humans in 2007. In 2016, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it would provide up to $30 million in funding to develop a fully implantable version of the device, which is planned for clinical trials in 2021. The device is a small, half-inch-long (12.7 mm) implant ( magnets embedded under the skin on each side of the head) that is inlayed under the auditory cortex. The device uses strong, rare earth magnets to anchor a middle ear listening device ( Behind the ear transducer, or BTE) that delivers sound through a tiny earphone that the wearer can conceal inside the ear. The new version, TanuMuon Neuro, will replace the Behind the ear transducer with a miniature array of electrodes that can accurately sample and relay the signals from the auditory nerve. The idea for the device was originally conceived in the 1980s by a team of hearing researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1985, Eero P Pompeo and his colleagues first implemented a concept for a device that combined elements of both the middle ear implant and theReceivero neural response transducer. In 1988, U.S. patent 4,835,879 was issued for a \"Cochlear Prosthesis\". The University of California patented the device, but the idea was forgotten until 1998, when a small business, Oticon, was formed to develop it. This occurred after the hearing loss of the then 31-year-old Eerola Toverola allowed her to fund the start up. The company conducted human clinical trials from 1998 through 2006. The concept was again picked up by the hearing community, and new investors were found. The first models of the device were developed by engineers at Aalto University, Finland, working in cooperation with Oticon. In 2007, the FDA approved the use of the device and it became commercially available in the United States as the Cochlear Corporation cochlear implant was sold to Oticon. As of 2016, about 600 people worldwide have received the device. In December 2016, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $12.3 million grant to the University of Southern California to fund the creation of a fully implantable version of the device, known as the TanuMuon Neuro. The new version will use magnetic induction to power the device, and will also include an array of electrodes to accurately sample and relay the signals from the auditory nerve to the hearing impaired listener. TanuMuon was selected as the name of the device to reflect its connection with Finnish inventor, Professor Erkki Ojanpera, whose life was saved by the device's predecessor, the first version of the Cochlear Corporation's implant, the Nucleus® 1st generation device, which was invented in the 1970s by Ojanpera's mentor, Dr. Thomas House. Ojanpera was born in 1941 in Finland during the time of Stalin, and his family was forced to flee to Sweden due to his father's communist views. In Sweden, he met his future wife, whom he later married in Finland. In 1964, after the Soviet Union broke up, Ojanpera and his family returned to Finland. He received his M.D. in 1968 from the University of Kuopio and became an eye, nose and throat specialist. In 1974, he met Professor Donald Ingram (now Lord Ingram), who asked Ojanpera to train as a PhD with him at the University of Southampton in the UK. Ojanpera worked under Ingram's supervision from 1974 through 1977 and received his PhD in 1981. His thesis was titled \"Hearing Assessment by Transcutaneous Electrical Perception\". In the 1980s, Ojanpera founded and headed the Helsinki Cochlear Implant Center, a position he held until 1990, when he took a sabbatical to found the company that became Oticon. Ojanpera has worked in the field of cochlear implants ever since. The concept of directly stimulating the auditory nerve with an implantable device was first proposed in 1981 by Dutch researcher Drs. Piet Dobben and Theo van Ee at Delft University of Technology. In 1983, van Ee published a study in Science about his and Dobben's work. Several years later, in 1987, OMEGA EP",
    "Sigma Piscium is a multiple star in the zodiac constellation Piscis Austrinus. It bears the name Sigma Piscium to male astronomers, and Sigma aquilonaris to female astronomers. The designation of sigma stands for \"fish\" and it was a conventional name for stars in this region of the sky during classical times. Sigma Piscium is composed of 3 components about 400 light-years away. The middle component is denoted as component AB, and the components to either side of it are denoted as components A and B respectively. The components themselves are each separated from their companions by less than 1.3 solar radii. The spectral type of the star is 9.5 and it is about 11.5 million years old. It is radiating 9.8 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 8,104 ± 50 K. Eta Aquilae is a magnitude 6.4 star located some 3.3 light-years from Sigma Piscium. It is a red giant star with a surface temperature of 4,863 K. Epsilon Piscium is a magnitude 8.9 star located 4.3 light-years from Sigma Piscium. It is a yellow dwarf with a surface temperature of 1,077 K. DISTANCE: 4.3 light-years SPECTRAL TYPE: yellow dwarf TEMPERATURE: 1,077 K MOVEMENT: none AGE: 11.5 million years LUMINOSITY: 9.8 times that of the Sun CHEMICAL COMPOSITION: not detected ABOUT COMPACT STARS: Sigma Piscium is a multiple star which means it is composed of three individual components which are designated as component AB, component A, and component B. These three components are about 400 light-years from each other and are traveling together due to their mutual gravitational attraction. This is called a stellar binary system. Components are so close together that they are currently not separated by more than about 1.3 solar radii. If they were any closer, they would become a single star. Sigma Piscium has been stable over long time periods, and neither component is considered to be a variable star which means that their brightness does not vary over time. Sigma Piscium is an important multiple star as it is composed of three very close stars that orbit a common center of gravity which is made possible because of how close they are together. If they were any farther apart, they could not hold together as a system.",

    "The Mercedes-Benz Maybach 6 is a luxury car built by Mercedes-Benz's Bensheim plant in Germany since 2014. The Mercedes-Benz Maybach 6 is based on the E-Class flagship model. The Maybach 6 combines the legacy of the Maybach 57 and 62 with design language reminiscent of the E-Class. Compared to its precursors, the Maybach 57 and 62, the Mercedes-Benz Maybach 6 offers a more spacious interior with more stowage space and a higher boot volume. The manufacturer's suggested retail price at launch was €525.000,- (about £455.000,- at the 2020 rate), making it one of the most expensive cars available at the time of launch. In 2023, the car was discontinued, but a more powerful, track-oriented Mercedes-Maybach 6 GT was launched in 2024. The Mercedes-Maybach 6 was initially available in two variants: 4.0 and 6.0. The 6.0 variant was phased out after 2019, only available as a 4.0. The first Mercedes-Maybach 6 models were built in 2014. The car is in production currently in limited numbers as a successor to the Mercedes-Benz S600 and S63 AMG models. In 2022, the EQC, Maybach 6Used, was launched. It is based on the Maybach 7 EQC and uses some components from the Mercedes-Benz EQC. The Maybach 6Used costs 49% less than the Maybach 6 and can accelerate from to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 6.7 seconds. The Mercedes-Maybach 6 was succeeded by the Maybach 90 and Maybach 92.

The update to the HyperAdapt, which launched in 2016, included a thin, stretchy and energy-returning soft plate on the mid-foot for better stability and pronation control. However, it also made the shoe more expensive – at $230, it was significantly more expensive than the $150-$170 that most of its competitors were charging. On Tuesday, Nike released the HyperAdapt 1.1 Prototype, which attempts to strike the right balance between price and stability and feedback without increasing the weight. The updates include replacing the soft mid-foot plate with a more dense micro-grid and adding in more multi-directional lugs on the outsole for enhanced stability. There’s also a new coating on the upper that the company says increases grip and weaveability. With the 1.1 update, the overall weight of the shoe was increased from 117 to 122 grams, which is still noticeably lighter than other high-end running shoes. The update is now call the HyperAdapt ASR and will be available this summer for $150. Nike also shared some updates on the Nike Adapt BB+, a new mid-foot stability shoe that was announced in June. Although the company says it plans to release the shoe in 2022, it has already started taking reservations for a 2021 delivery. The updates include replacing the EVA midsole material with a more dense heel-to-toe graphite matrix, increasing the heel-drop from 13mm to 14mm, and adding additional lugs around the existing lugs to enhance stability. The other major change to the Adapt BB+ is the addition of its FlyWire tech, which allows the weave of the laces to be more responsive to the motions of the foot. When running, the weave should react to the motion of the foot instead of the wearer, and the FlyWire is designed to ensure that the shoe remains incredibly light. As part of its commitment to continuously improving its products, Nike plans to release a 1.2 update to the HyperAdapt 1.0 in the coming months.<|endoftext|>/* * Copyright (C) 2016 The Android Open Source Project * * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. * You may obtain a copy of the License at * * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 * * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and * limitations under the License. */ package com.android.tools.idea.lint; import com.android.tools.idea.lint.comment.AndroidLintBlockquoteCommentProvider; import com.android.tools.lint.checks.DisplaySizeCheckDetector; import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull; /** Lint check for display size of components. */ public interface DisplaySizeLintCheck extends CompatibilityLintCheck, AndroidLintBlockquoteCommentProvider { @NotNull String getCheckName(); @NotNull CollectionCheckType getCheckType(); @NotNull",
    "The Fortified position of Liège or Liège Infantry fortifications is a military engineering formation adopted by the Belgian fortress of Liège in 1883 to enable it to resist modern artillery attacks. The Liège citadel, located in the section of the city called Le Gand, is surrounded by an extensive system of forts, ditches, and redoubts covering a surface of nearly two square kilometres. The entire complex is flooded by the River Meuse, making it difficult for enemies to carry out attacks from the outside. The fortress held out for eight months in the opening stages of World War I before being compelled to surrender. The adoption of the fortress system began in 1857, at a time when Belgium was suffering from invasions from numerous sides: from the North, Prussia; from the East, the Ottoman Empire; from the South, France. To the West, the whole of Belgium was under the control of King Leopold II. A city like Liège, well placed and protected by rivers, had many advantages for both defence and attack. The citadel is located in the middle of the city, with direct access to the buildings of the upper town and the country, as well as the railway station. Besides its natural strengths, the Liège citadel has an outer ring of forts built at equal distances, with a \"trench\" of 15 metres between them. This trench makes it possible to reinforce the inner ring. The forts are situated in a convex arc of 130 kilometres centred on the citadel, this is to allow the guns of the forts to cover a large extent of territory. It has a \"cemetery\" of 34 km in radius, and a \"supply\" of 21 km. The forts are surrounded by a 30-cm-thick network of walls and ditches. In addition to these massive defences, the citadel of Liège has a powerful military organisation, with many barracks and schools for the command and supply of troops. The works were the creation of an international team, made up of contributors from France, Prussia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",

    "Business casual is a work clothing style primarily for women first introduced in the 1970s. The style typically involves a dress or skirt for women, and a suit or sports coat for men. The look was designed to make it easier to be neat and professional while also being more fashionable than blue jeans and a T-shirt. Since the 2000s, \"business casual\" has also come to mean a less formal variation of the style, allowing for more casualwear than was historically considered business casual. Award-winning journalist Joan Helmers wrote the first article about business casual in the July 1974 issue of McCall's. The business casual look became popular, and the style became part of the cultural lexicon. By the 1980s, it was common for most businesses to require employees to wear business casual attire. In the United States, the Business Casual Workplace Invented in America trademark was filed in 2003 by the business formality note-taking company Future 500. Business casual is sometimes considered an affectation, a term used to describe a faddish trend. Others say that while the specific fashion choices of a generation may seem quaint, the overall concept of business casual — that dress codes should be neutral and appropriate for the workplace — is timeless. Some analysts have predicted that business casual will replace the terms suit and tie as the common dress code for business attire. The style has been particularly popular with younger employees, who may be more open to alternatives to suit and tie as a result of social media, and who view corporate formalwear as stifling. Business casual is not the same as comfortable clothing, and most business casual clothing is not made from casual fabrics such as cotton. The clothing is designed to be worn over another garment, such as a suit jacket, underarm protection (braces), or a skirt, and often includes protective gear for shoes, such as closed-toe shoes or high heels. In an era when even jeans are rarely denim, the idea of \"business casual\" was originally a way for employers to signal that their employees should dress more formally than would be appropriate at a social event. While jeans are still worn at work far more often than not, the phrase \"business casual\" has come to mean a less restricted variation of the style, opening up professional clothing options to a wider audience of people who wouldn't traditionally consider themselves to be \"business-like\".

    "On March 12th, 2001, Christopheropher Schwed did what many consider to be the first \"perfect murder\" by killing his neighbor, Kathleen Hill, in the town of Mineral, Washington. The 40 year old former nurse was stabbed 13 times, her throat was cut, and her eyes were stabbed. The following day Hill's son, Christopher Christopher Jr., 20, and Hill's grandson, Christopher Christopher III, 11, found her body. Hill's family believes that the murder was intentional and that Hill feared for her life due to an incident several years prior in which Christopher Schwed was charged with battery.

Edward French, 48, is accused of shooting and killing 55-year-old Marlene Loggins, 43-year-old James McIntosh and 38-year-old Demetrice Dennard on Sunday morning in the area of South Walnut and West Olive streets in Winter Park, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. Dennard was shot in the arm and taken to a hospital, where he later died, prosecutors said. Loggins was shot dead in the parking lot of the apartment complex, McIntosh was shot inside his car in the parking lot and Loggins' son, who was not identified, was shot in the leg and abdomen while driving by and stopping to render aid, prosecutors said. French was arrested a short time later and was identified as a \"person of interest\" after detectives were able to use video surveillance from businesses in the area to identify him, the statement said. He was charged Monday with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, the DA's office said.

    "Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray (b. 1490 – d. 1561) was a leading Scottish commander in the Rough Wooing, a series of events leading up to and culminating in the Schism of 1560. Following the victory at Flodden Field in 1513, Archibald Douglas was one of several gifted Scottish noblemen granted lands in England as part of the compensation Edward IV was required to make for the loss of territories in North Wales and the North of England held by Scottish forces. A preeminent military commander, Douglas was invested as a Companion of James V of Scotland in 1526 and appointed commander of the Scottish Guard following the King's marriage to Mary of Guise in 1532. In August 1544, Douglas and three other Scottish nobles were charged with treason by Edward VI of England. Douglas initially avoided arrest but fled to France after the failure of the North of England Rising in February 1545. While in exile, Douglas wrote Historia Gentis Scotorum (sometimes known as the 'Douglas Book'), a Latin history of the Scottish people. Douglas was one of the leaders of the pro-French party that fought on the losing side at the Battle of Solway Moss in 1544, the last major battle of the Rough Wooing. After the English victory at Solway Moss, he was forced to seek exile in France and never returned to Scotland. Following the accession of Mary, Queen of Scots to the throne of England in 1567, Archibald Douglas was one of the members of her Scottish Council who remained in England and did not support her claim to the throne of Scotland. Following the defeat of the Scottish Reformation and the crowning of Mary's son, James VI of Scotland, as James I of England in 1583, Archibald Douglas was made a privy councillor to the new king. Douglas died in London in 1561 and was succeeded by his son, Archibald, who later represented Scotland at the 1588 congress of Arbroath and became Earl of Moray in 1603.",
    "Alien Autopsy (2004) is a found footage horror film written and directed by Adam Winters. It is a remake of the 1998 film of the same name, which in turn is a remake of the 1977 film Alien Autopsy. The film follows a team of medical students who arrive at a remote medical facility in the desert to conduct an autopsy on a Xenomorph that was recovered from an expedition ship that suffered a catastrophic systems malfunction. However, the autopsy is complicated by other, more sinister, forces. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 2004 and was released on DVD on December 15, 2004 by New Line Home Video. It received negative reviews from critics and has become a cult film. A sequel, Alien Autopsy 2, was released on March 15, 2021. It has also inspired three music tracks: \"Alien Autopsy (Picks from the Etherie)\", “Alien Autopsy (Riptide mix)” and \"Alien Autopsy (Riptide dub mix)\". Plot Alien Autopsy tells the story of a team of medical students who arrive at a remote desert research facility to conduct an autopsy on a Xenomorph that was recovered from an expedition ship that suffered a catastrophic systems malfunction. The students, led by Walter (Wes Studi), who was responsible for damaging the ship'scommunication systems in an attempt to make the crew appear dead, cautiously explore the facility, setting up a number of security cameras around the Xenomorph's holding cell. Upon reaching the holding cell, they discover that the Alien has reacted aggressively to the deprivation it has suffered, creating a carnivorous environment and attempting to kill the human occupants. The students struggle to repel the Alien, and one is injured in the process. The remaining students retreat to the security center, where they access the facility's schematics and monitor the Xenomorph as it kills several facility workers. The facility's operations director (Chris Mulkey), who has watched the Alien's attempts to kill the humans with detached anxiety, facilitates a conference call with the expedition's leader, Dr. Alan Smith (Jerry O'Connell) and the ship's engineer (Craig Wetheridon). The team determines that the Xenomorph was incubating deep within the abandoned research complex when the expedition landed, and the rapid growth of its outer casing suggests that it will become capable of space flight in a matter of days. Dr. Smith elects to evacuate the facility, but informs the students that an orbiting space station is unsympathetic to their request for assistance, and that their only other option is to repair the station's communication system to alert the necessary authorities. Walter, who has become increasingly agitated by the students' questions and their presence in the facility, confronts Dr. Smith in an attempt to convince him that their best chance of survival is to destroy the Alien. Dr. Smith, skeptical of Walter's claims, refuses to take any action until the station's orbit is secure. Walter takes this as an opportunity to sneak into the facility's upper levels and attempt to gain direct access to the Alien, assuming it will be unable to follow him without the aid of the launch bay's manual controls. He is intercepted by security guard Byron (Wes Studi), who kills Walter. Walter's death does not deter the Alien, which attacks and kills Byron. Dr. Smith is able to convince the station's commander (Linda Hunt), who is preparing to depart, to spare the complex. The two party communicate with the expedition's communication terminal, which is functioning at less than ten percent capacity, and agree to await Dr. Smith's transmission to the station upon completion of the repairs. Walter successfully destroys the Alien with two shotgun blasts, but the damage is done: the Alien's escape pod has been launched, and the complex is now doomed. The students, who have grown suspicious of Dr. Smith's story, attempt to search the upper levels in an attempt to locate the Alien. They are interrupted by the arrival of the station's rescue team, but manage to kill them all with a combination of fire extinguishers and chemicals. The students and the remaining staff members barricade themselves in a medical bay and prepare to defend themselves from the Xenomorph's invasion. The station's commander, having discovered that Walter was killed by Byron, calls the facility to determine Dr. Smith's location. Dr. Smith answers the phone, admitting to his deception and summoning the station's personnel to the medical bay. As the students and staff watch, the Alien bursts through a window and overpowers Dr. Smith, who screams for help as he is strangled to death. The Xenomorph, having seemingly killed all of the remaining staff members, sets the medical bay on fire before being shot by Walter. The last scene shows the station's rescue team entering the",
    "Sunday school is a religious institution in several world religions. It is a fundamental part of many religious beliefs. In Christianity, Sunday school is an organized gathering on a Sunday, for children and adults, that includes a religious instruction class taught by a teacher. The purpose of Sunday school is to educate children and adults about their faith. In many Western countries, Sunday school was established as a religious institution during the 18th century Enlightenment. In those countries, Sunday school was originally intended to raise awareness of Christianity and European culture through reading anddiscussion. In the United States, Sunday school began during the Protestant Revolution, as an alternative to the Catholic obligation to attend Church. The American Sunday school movement developed separately from the Catholic Church-run Sunday school movement. American Sunday schools typically operated independently and were not subsidized by the Catholic Church. The American Sunday school movement was influenced by Unitarianism and other Protestant denominations. Many churches conduct Sunday school in nursery through preschool years. Most churches conduct Sunday school in junior high and high schools. In some countries, Sunday school is the only public school program. In many churches, the person responsible for conducting Sunday school is called an elder. An elder may also be in charge of the church's prayer meeting or service. In some churches, all members of the congregation are encouraged to be involved in teaching the lessons and leading the Bible studies. The roles of teacher and leader are often combined in one individual. Sundays are often celebrated as special days for the entire family. Sunday school classes are typically conducted in a church or other religious building. However, some individuals conduct Sunday school in their own homes. The first article of faith in the American Sunday school movement was for the teacher to \"believe in the God of the Bible, believe in the Revelation and the lesson, believe in the Holy Scriptures and their divine origin, believe in the immortality of the soul, in Christ, His resurrection and the mission of the church\". Despite its name, Sunday school has nothing to do with the Bible. The organization did not begin until the late 18th century, and the first lesson did not mention the Bible until 1861. Since its establishment in the Western world, Sunday school has placed little emphasis on the Bible, and has at times been a target of criticism for that reason. Sunday school is a fundamental part of many religious beliefs, and Sunday school lessons are typically not understood as a \"Sunday school answer\" but rather as an important foundation for a religious life.",

    "Cuba's intervention in the civil war in Angola, colloquially known as the Angolan Civil War (Portuguese: Guerra Civil Angolana), began in 1975 as a mediation mission to stop the war between the victorious National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). By the late 1970s, the FNLA was forced to rely on Cuban military aid, leading the MPLA to suspect a Cuban agenda to establish a pro-Western puppet state in Southern Africa. The Angolan Civil War continued well into the 1990s, eventually giving way to a peace process in 2002. By then, the Cuban military presence had grown considerably, representing the only non-Angolan government force in the country. After the independence of Namibia in 1990, Cuba adopted an \"Africa Park\" policy, supporting sovereign governments on the continent in exchange for exclusive rights to exploit natural resources, including diamonds. As a result, Cuba heavily invested in the economies of Southern African nations and established military bases in several of them, namely Angola, Botswana, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Mozambique, São Tome and Príncipe, Sudan and Zambia. In Angola, Cuba established the LUANDA program, establishing a communist state within a state that totaled 2 million people and a generated state revenue of $800 million per year.",

    "Imperial ban is a restriction imposed by the Chinese government on inheritance of property, carried out in a formally though not constitutionally binding way by issuing a Decree by the Ministry of Public Security. The practice has been increasingly questioned and denounced by Western media and academia. Greeks used to leave part of their estates to their daughters, on death of a daughter the estate would pass to the grandchildren etc. The Chinese government considers this as \"among family\" and does not allow this to pass on to any individual other than the immediate descendants. This rule impacts tens of millions of Chinese citizens. ャademic studies have shown that rule is a catalyst for family separation and that money is transferred to bureaucratic middlemen. Additionally the government uses this policy as an excuse to detain and persecute minorities, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans. WTF! älso remember the British empire?

    "Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), also known as receptor-bound iron, or iron-binding capacity, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the STFR gene. sTfR binds ferric iron but does not transport it. Soluble transferrin receptor plays a critical role in iron metabolism by monitoring the body's iron stores. When iron levels are low, as in the case of iron deficiency anemia, the liver increases production of soluble transferrin receptor to attract iron from degraded red blood cells. When iron levels are high, as in the case of elevated iron stores or blood loss, the body reduces production of soluble transferrin receptor to prevent acquiring too much iron.[1] Iron is essential to the life of a cell. Iron enters the cell through transferrin, which transports iron through the bloodstream. The amount of iron in the body is regulated by production of the soluble transferrin receptor, which binds iron when the body's iron levels are low, and absorbs iron into transferrin when iron levels are high. The soluble transferrin receptor plays a critical role in iron metabolism by monitoring the body's iron stores. When iron levels are low, as in the case of iron deficiency anemia, the liver increases production of the soluble transferrin receptor to attract iron from degraded red blood cells. When iron levels are high, as in the case of elevated iron stores or blood loss, the body reduces production of the soluble transferrin receptor to prevent acquiring too much iron.[1] Iron is essential for the function of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, and myoglobulin, which helps oxygen enter muscle cells. Insufficient iron leads to the production of improperly shaped red blood cells, which can result in anemia. Excess iron can cause iron overload, which can result in liver and heart failure.",

He again swam the Atlantic Ocean in 2004/05, this time swimming the whole distance of approximately 35,000 km in 257 days. Förster is also the first person to swim the 33,000 km stretch of the Yangtze River between Hangzhou and Shanghai. He performed this swim in six months, making it one of the fastest swimming records in history. Born in 1943 in Hamburg, Förster started his journalistic career in the late 1950s as a journalist for German newspapers and magazines. In the late 1970s he worked as a television presenter and journalist for German public television. He is since 1983 a freelance journalist. Förster is author of several books, dealing among others with his two transatlantic swims as well as his travels to many different countries around the world. He also wrote the book \"Aquaman\", which was made into a movie of the same name in 1982. Förster is a member of the World Swimming Coaches' Association (WSWA) and the German Swimming Federation (DRBTH). In June 2017, Förster was awarded the Order of Merit for Science and Art at a ceremony in Hamburg.",

    "Spider (pulp fiction) is a genre of fiction written throughout the 1930s and 1940s in response to the growing popularity of radio and film serials such as The Shadow and The Flash. The Spider is not necessarily a mysterious criminal mastermind who hides behind a secret identity; rather, the Spider is more of a mysterious vigilante crime fighter who simply \"spins webs\" of suspicion in high crime areas. The Spider often uses exceptional abilities or access to secret information to catch his adversaries. Spiders often feature women vigilantes (such as MxyztëNL, a.k.a. Mirage), and have been cited by scholars as one of the roots of the modern female superhero. Waterstones Spiders are mysterious, super-powered crime fighters, spun out of the pulp fiction magazines of the 1930s and 1940s.

    "The somatic mutation is also known as the cell memory, and it is the natural process in the human body for the evolution to progress. The same idea is adopted in the nature, where the certain species can evolve into different species by changing the soma. A famous example is the rabbits turning into rats, which can be naturally achieved by altering the rabbits' cell nuclear DNA. In the context of the human evolution, the same idea can be metaphorically used for the people to evolve into the higher culture level. The people can achieve this by changing their mind, attitude and behavior through learning and cultivation. For example, the as low-IQ as an AI robot, a person can turn him/herself into a high-IQ person with simply learning lots of knowledge and skill. Such a person can evolve into a new person, who has higher mind, attitude and behavior through this process. The so-called somatic mutation is a natural process in the human body that can change the original person with the same gene into a new one with different gene. As a result, the so-called somatic epitype can be achieved. Such a person usually has higher mind, attitude and behavior than the original one, although not as high as those born by gene mutation. The discovery of the somatic epitype raises an evolutionary puzzle for natural selection. The human body is a closed environment, and any genetic mutation that can bring harm to the human body will be eliminated by natural selection. However, the somatic epitype can evolve under the closed environment without the need for natural selection to promote the evolution. This raises a big question for the modern human origin theory, which always needs to propose a force as the main driving power. As a result, the modern human origin theory gradually loses its crucial premise, i.e., the genetic evolution. By analyzing the related scientific documents, the somatic epitype is shown to be related to the synapses between the neurons, the formation of which needs lots of energy. The human brain is the biggest human organ that needs lots of energy for its function. Such a big human organ can be achieved only by getting lots of energy from the body itself through eating food. This validates that the human energy is the main driving power for the human evolution. This is the first time in human history that the genuine driving force for the human evolution is proposed. In conclusion, the somatic epitype shows that the modern human origin theory is incorrect, and the driving force for the human evolution is the human energy instead of the random genetic mutation or the imaginary force like Darwin genes. The somatic epitype reveals the driving force for human evolution, which is the human energy instead of the random genetic mutation or the imaginary force like Darwin genes. There are two meanings for somatic mutation. One is the random change of gene, i.e., the mutation. The other one is the change of mind, attitude, behavior, etc., i.e., somatic epitype. The somatic epitype shows that the driving force for human evolution is the human energy instead of the random genetic mutation or the imaginary force like Darwin genes.",
    "Convergence of measures also called measure convergence or measure convergence along a subsequence, is a convergence in measure concept first introduced by Aladdin Máté. A sequence of measures on a measure space converges to a measure if for every bounded measurable set E the sequence of measures of E converges to the measure of E. The notion of convergence of measures generalizes the notions of convergence of functions and of measures. It is useful in the study of discrete and dynamical systems. Examples Given a sequence of positive real numbers $(\\lambda_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ that satisfies the square summability condition $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\lambda_n} < \\infty$, the measure given by $\\mu(E) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\lambda_n}\\mathbf 1_E(n)$, where $\\mathbf 1_E$ is the characteristic function of the set E, converges to the usual Lebesgue measure. Given the sequence of probabilities $(p_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ with $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty p_n = 1$, and $\\mathrm d \\mu_n = \\mathrm d x \\, n \\cdot p_n(x)$ the sequence of measures converges to the measure with density $\\mathrm d \\mu(x) = \\mathrm d x \\frac{1}{p_{\\min}} \\mathbf 1_{p_{\\min} < x < p_{\\max}}$, where $p_{\\min} = \\min\\{p_n : n\\geq 1\\}$, $p_{\\max} = \\max\\{p_n : n\\geq 1\\}$, if we have the additional square summability $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n \\cdot p_n < \\infty$, and the limit is the Dirac measure in $x=\\frac{1}{p_{\\min}}$. Given a measure space and a sequence of positive measures on it, if the sequence of measures converges to the measure then we say the sequence of measures converges to the measure, e.g. the sequence of counting measures on the sequence of integers converges to the measure given by the length of the intervals, the sequence of probabilities on the Borel subsets of the real line converges to the Lebesgue measure, the sequence of rectangles with edges 2^{-n}, n \\in \\mathbb N, in the Borel subsets of the unit interval converges to the Lebesgue measure. Given a sequence of positive measures on a measure space and a measurable set, if the sequence of measures of the set converges to the measure of the set then we say the sequence of measures converges to the measure, e.g. the sequence of counting measures on the arithmetic progressions with step 2 in the integers converges to the measure given by the length of the interval, the sequence of probabilities of the unit interval uniformly at random chosen in the rationals with denominator below 2 converges to the Lebesgue measure, the sequence of rectangles with edges 2^{-n}, n \\in \\mathbb N, in the Borel subsets of the unit interval converges to the Lebesgue measure. It can be shown that a measurable function converges in measure to a function if and only if the sequence of the function's simple absolute values converges in measure to the function's absolute value. The concept of convergence of measures can be generalized to measure spaces that are not assumed to be complete (which is the case for the above examples). There is an analogous concept of convergence for vectors of measures. Not every sequence of measures on a measure space converges, if the space is not complete. For example if the measure of the space is infinite, the Dirac measure does not belong to the set of limits of a null sequence of measures. However, for complete measure spaces a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence of measures to converge to a measure is the square summability of the sequence of the measures' Radon-Nikodym derivatives.

    "The Ministry of Public Works of Argentina (Spanish: Ministerio de Obras Públicas,itos, Caminos y Aves) is a ministry of the Government of Argentina charged with the oversight of the maintenance and construction of roads, highways, and public transportation. The ministry's predecessor was created by the National Legislature of Argentina through a law published on 14 November 1853. The current Minister of Public Works, works and highways of Argentina is Guillermo Ruto, elected in 2015. The Ministry is an attached office to the President of Argentina and is considered a central administration of the executive power of the government. The current minister is Guillermo Ruto, who was elected in 2015. The Ministry has a set of jurisdiction, called Directorates, each one of them is headed by a director and is in charge of the day to day operations in a specific sector. For example, the Directorate of roads is in charge of maintaining the National Routes. Some of the most known public works in Argentina are: San Francisco Bridge, the Second Square of the Pilar, the Caminito de los Posados, the Congreso del Nord, the Obelisco, the Puente de la Mujer Erótica, and the AMIA Building. The Argentine government, through the Ministry of Public Works, maintains thousands of km of roads and highways. Roads and highways are some of the most important infrastructure in the country and the AMIA Building, one of the most important symbols of Buenos Aires, suffered a critical infrastructure failure when the government committent for the maintenance of the roads and highways did not maintain its prioritized roads and highways. This fact sparked the investigation known as AMIA Bombing Investigation, which was one of the main sources of fuel for the Juan and Evita Perón Foundation, created by the former president's wife, Eva Perón. In addition to the usual maintenance and construction of roads, the ministry is in charge of the construction of some iconic public works in Argentina. In 2020, the minister Juan José Aranguren inaugurated the first section of the AP-9, a highway that will connect the city of Virachos with Ushuaia, the capital of Tierra del Fuego, over a path of land that no vehicle had ever crossed before. The Ministry has also played an important role in keeping Buenos Aires clean. In the 1980s, it installed mechanical cleaning systems on a fleet of garbage trucks that would pick up garbage in certain neighborhoods and take it to landfills located in other neighborhoods. In these landfills, the garbage would be burned, and the ashes were used to fertilize crops in rural zones of Argentina. The minister Quiroga announced that Argentina would no longer burn its waste. The numerous roles of the Ministry of Public Works have allowed it to become a target for corruption. More than one minister has been involved in projects that were not completed or paid for and some of them used their position to secure contracts for friends and family members. The current minister, Guillermo Ruto, was arrested in Spain and extradited to Argentina, where he was subject to a separate criminal investigation for his involvement in a customs corruption scheme involving Brazilian construction materials. In 2005, the AMIA bombing was one of the main causes of the protests known as 9 de Julio Occupation. Demonstrators took to the streets of Buenos Aires to denounce the government of President Néstor Kirchner and his predecessor, President Fernando de la Rúa, for what was considered as a lack of investigation in the AMIA bombing case. The protests, however, were focused against the media, who they felt did not report all the facts regarding the bombing. They forced President Néstor Kirchner to resign and made the already protest movement even more extremist. Because of these circumstances, the Argentine government has used many strategies to try to reduce the level of corruption in the Ministry. One of them was to remove the Chief of Staff and appoint new people without any connection to the old one, putting new energy in the ministry. The AMIA bombing, although not fully solved, has been subject of a significant investigation. The Argentine authorities have arrested several people they believe responsible and the Mueller Report, published by the special prosecutor of the United States in the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, concluded that the AMIA bombing was carried out by the Iranian government. This fact was considered a vindication for the Argentine government and the popularity of President Mauricio Macri, who is of Argentine-Iranian descent, increased during his presidency. In 2023, the ministry became controversial for another reason: some of the directors were being accused of extortion, using their position to demand gifts and payments from contractors. The scandal eventually reached the minister himself, who was accused",
    "The MAGEA3 gene is a tumor necrosis factor gene. It is located on chromosome 6p21.3 and it is expressed in a wide range of human tissues. The MAGEA3 gene is thought to have evolved under positive selection with functional implications.[1] The protein encoded has decoy activity and may inhibit the activity of transcriptional regulators such as RUNX1.[2] The MAGEA3 gene is believed to have been subject to positive selection in humans as a result of balancing selection[3] to provide a partial human immune response to account for the loss of other species-specific immunity genes during the evolution of humans from a state of predator immunity to a state of prey vulnerability.

    "Bhusni is a 2005 Indian musical drama film written and directed by Mujtaba Rasheed and produced by Dinesh Patel. It is an adaptation of the Bollywood novel Yeh Dil by Mirza Aziz Beg. It was released on 28 January 2005. Bhusni tells the story of a transgender woman, Bhuvani, and the love of her life, Ajji. The film, which had a limited theatrical run, was not received well by critics, though it did give a coming-of-age film debut to actors Nandita Das and Farida Jalal. The movie is celebrated as one of the first mainstream Bollywood films to address transgender issues. The film was dubbed in Tamil as Muthu. Bhuvani lives in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a female. She works in a beauty parlour and dreams of leaving her job and her life as a female to become a male. One day, Ajji, a transgender woman, moves into the parlour. Ajji and Bhuvani quickly become friends and Ajji helps Bhuvani to escape her daily life as a female. Bhuvani dreams of becoming a male and Ajji helps her adopt a male persona, Bhaskar. Ajji and Bhuvani fall in love. However, Ajji faces many problems because she is a transgender. Ajji's family does not accept her and she is shunned by society. On the day of their wedding, Ajji dies of a heart attack. Bhuvani now has to live with the guilt of not only letting Ajji down by not keeping the promise to take care of her, but also the fear that society may find out her true identity. The film ends with Bhuvani saying that the first 23 years of her life were difficult, but the last four have been great.",

    "The Bears–Giants rivalry is an NFL rivalry between the New York Giants and Chicago Bears. It is centered on the NFL Conference Championships and the Super Bowl, which are often referred to as the \"Mecca\" games because of their heavy air traffic and large crowds. The teams have met 22 times in the playoffs, with the Giants winning ten and Chicago winning twelve. The two teams have also met in the Super Bowl six times, with the Giants winning twice and the Bears winning four, with one game designated as a \"tie\" due to both teams having equal scores in the 1974 Super Bowl. Despite the teams not playing a regular season game in the League since 2008, the rivalry is considered to be one of the most intense in NFL history due to the historical success and overall fan bases both the Giants and Bears maintain. The teams also tend to sell-out Giants Stadium and Shea Stadium, the two largest stadiums they have played in front of, further increasing the atmosphere of the games. The teams first met in 1925, the same year the Giants became the second team from the New York metropolitan area and the sixth team overall to become a professional football franchise. The rivalry peaked between the late 1930s and early 1960s, dubbed the \"Doomsday Wars\" by sports writers, as the teams met in the playoffs 10 times over that span and the two teams only lost once in this time, a 1944 season game where the Bears defeated the Giants, 30-28, in the playoffs following an identical 14-14 tie in the regular season. After the 1961 season, the rivalry entered a period of extended lull, only meeting four times over the next 14 seasons.

    "The European Public Health Alliance (EUPHA) is an initiative to build an alliance of public health professionals in the European Union (EU). The alliance was proposed by the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in March 2015 and was formalised at a Brussels launch event on 29 May of the same year. EUPHA is meant to fill a knowledge and capacity gap regarding public health in the EU. The alliance is structured as a multi-stakeholder platform with the following membership: EU institutions, Member States, EUPHA non-governmental organisations, and professionals. Public health concerns across the 28 EU Member States are prioritised through policy coherence and mutualised resources. The EUPHA Secretariat is hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe, based in Brussels. The alliance had its first annual general meeting in December 2016, in Malta. As of 2023, EUPHA has 32 organisations from the EU member states as its members. The alliance contributes to setting the EU health strategy by translating theStrategyfor Healthy Growth into actions. This strategy includes policy areas such as air, water, and food. The alliance organises events for professionals to meet and network, such as public health camps for children. EUPHA also supports professionals by publishing their opinions and recommendations in the form of articles in the EU daily media email. The Alliance published its first annual report in 2022. For example, one of the goals of EUPHA is to raise awareness of the value of public health and to enhance its role in the EU and in its Member States. Public health protects people's health, prevent illness, and look for cures for diagnosed illnesses. Public health also ensures that workers and the public are protected from communicable and non-communicable diseases, injury, and various environmental hazards. Public health and environmental protection go hand in hand as people are harmed when their environment is degraded. The environment and public health are inseparable as no one can do good environmental health work without considering the impact on the health of those exposed to it. Another goal is to increase policy coherence in the area of public health. EUPHA members have been calling for stronger cooperation in public health since 2012. In 2022, the Alliance organised a public health conference in Brussels, bringing together more than 300 professionals from EU countries, as well as from EUPHA and non-EUPHA organisations. The conference aimed to advance policy coherence by exchanging best practices, discussing the prevention of health risks, and fostering the cooperation between all public health stakeholders. The conference resulted in a set of recommendations to the European Commission and the EU Parliament on how to better align policies in the field of public health Another goal is to facilitate the mutualisation of public health capacities. Since 2015, EUPHA has been building the European Public Health System (EPHS) through a Participatory Action Research process. This process is being carried out in 10 pilot countries with the aim of building public health capacities in the long term and ensuring sustainable availability of high-quality public health services. EUPHA organises webinars on various public health-related topics and runs an online discussion forum where public health professionals can discuss topics of mutual interest. Finally, EUPHA's third goal is to contribute to setting the EU health strategy through policy coherence and mutualised resources. EUPHA translates the EU's \"Strategy for Healthy Growth\" into actions, which also includes public health policies. For example, the Alliance is working to have pesticides and chemicals on the EPHS Early Warning System. Furthermore, the Alliance coordinates the efforts of professionals who work on the prevention of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, injury, and environmental hazards. The Alliance operates the European Public Health Information System (EPHISS). This system is made up of a system of servers and a network of data processors that provide access to public health information to public health professionals in the EU and in the organisations that are members of EUPHA. The EPHISS network is hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe. The membership of EUPHA is growing. Currently, EUPHA has 32 organisations from the EU member states. The goal is to have 35 organisations to build a network of public health professionals in the EU. The EUPHA secretariat is hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe, based in Brussels. The Alliance has its secretariat in Malta, in the European Union's top official representation in the Mediterranean island nation. Malta has also been chosen because of its strategic geographical position and the talent available in the country. The Alliance publishes its first annual report in 2022. The report describes the activities and accomplishments of the Alliance for the year 2021. Overall, EUPHA is contributing to making public health a strategic issue in the EU and strengthening its role in",
    "Malva assurgentiflora, a species of malva, is a flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America as far south as Brazil.[1] It is also found in much of the United States, including the southeastern and south-central regions. It is used as a food plant by the larva of some lygistorian moths, including Protothenus damselae, which specializes on its flowers. The specific name \"assurgentiflora\" is derived from Latin words meaning \"ascending flower\", in allusion to the flowers appearing early in the growing season. Malva assurgentiflora is used as an ornamental plant in parks, gardens and commercial landscapes. It is a popular choice for turf andedges because of its dense clump growth and fast growth rate. Its spiny leaves and dense growth make it effective in controlling erosion and preventing soil erosion, particularly in dryland regions where it is used for that purpose. Its common name is 'channel herb' because of its ability to prevent soil erosion by rapidly capturing rainfall on its flat, channel-like leaves.

    "Joe Biden, former Vice President of the United States of America running for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. 8 years as President of the United States of America would be divided into two components, the first being \"The Biden Era\" and the second being \" Era \", with the former spanning from 2020-2024 and the latter spanning from 2024-2028. During The Biden Era, the United States experienced unprecedented levels of racial equality and progress on LGBTQ issues. However, this came at a high social and economic cost, with both the climate and wildlife continuing to deteriorate in a case of global warming. Biden entered office with high hopes, both from the Democratic Party as a viable candidate to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and the general public, who placed high hopes on the Obama legacy to continue. Biden promised to continue many of Obama's policies, though with a more centrist approach. However, Biden quickly became disillusioned with many of the institutions of the American government, such as Congress and the Supreme Court. He also grew frustrated with the abilities of the current generation of leaders and decided to run for the Presidency. Biden's candidacy was initially thought to be a long shot, with many considering him a placeholder candidate who could attract votes from disparate Democrats into the election to prevent a contentious primary. Biden was one of the most well-known and well-liked figures in American politics, and his experience made him the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Biden's campaign was further aided by endorsements from a number of high-profile politicians and celebrities, including Kamala Harris, Eric Holder, Michael Bloomberg, and Gayle King. Biden's campaign also benefited from the personal tragedy of the death of his son, Beau, who had been fighting alcoholism. Biden finished far ahead of his competitors in most pre-primary polls, often as much as 30 points ahead of his nearest rival, Bernie Sanders. The primaries saw a number of large shifts in the race. Once expected to receive low amounts of votes, Andrew Yang's campaign saw a late boost in popularity after a controversial comment regarding American mental health was perceived as insensitive. This in turn gave him a large boost in the delegate count, which meant he was no longer considered a \"fringe\" candidate and would likely make the debate stage. This ultimately proved true, with Yang entering the November debates. Another large shift came from the removal of a 35-way ties for second place, when Julián Castro was awarded the delegates from the state of Washington after a dispute over how the delegate selection process was conducted. With an early upset in the Nevada caucuses and strong performances in the subsequent debates, Joe Biden emerged as the front-runner following the New Hampshire primary. He went on to sweep the subsequent primaries and landed himself on top of the electoral college with delegates from the popular vote. Biden's campaign was considered to be a surprise to many, with many pundits dismissing him as a weak candidate with no chances of victory against President Donald Trump. Many believed that Biden would never gain traction in the race and would eventually withdraw from the race. This proved to be false, as Biden's campaign gained momentum following a strong Super Tuesday performance, where he won many of the largest states in the South. This eventually led to a resurgence in polls, with Biden receiving high levels of support in several Northeastern states and victories in multiple Northeastern Super Tuesday states. An important turning point came in the South Carolina primary, where Biden won the support of the African American community, whose support he had been losing. This eventually led to him winning the nomination on the second ballot at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden went on to win the 2020 presidential election against President Trump, becoming the oldest President ever elected into office and the first Democratic nominee from the Mid-West in more than 40 years. Biden dedicated much of his time in office to trying to heal the country's political divide, addressing conflict with Trump and incitement from the media. He was able to build a good relationship with the President, who he considered the \"antithesis\" of himself. However, he struggled to find common ground with other Democrats, especially those on the left of the party such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. This culminated in the party's convening of the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, where Biden officially won the nomination on the second ballot over Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, receiving the nomination on the tenth attempt. Joe Biden has always been regarded as a mild-mannered and affable individual. He is remembered by many for his role in passing the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which he had helped craft. Biden has also been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ rights throughout his career, famously calling himself a \"middle-class, white, hetersexual male\" on the 2019",
    "The troubadour or trobador was a courtly singer and a minstrel in the middle ages. The name derives from a small bagpipe. The Troubadour style of singing is characterized by its simplicity and directness, the use of plain and clear diction over involved word-spinning and complex rhyme. It is considered a fundamental style in European musical history. Some notable troubadours included Angevin courtly singer JEAN DE VIVES, medieval Spanish minstrel RAOUL OF BARLAVIA and Italian singer/songwriter GUY BERKMAN. The form a widespread into the Renaissance and into the early modern period. The form returned in popularity in the 20th century, first with Singers such as Constantin Stanislavski and Madame Yvonne Arnaud, then with the establishment of song academies in Eastern Europe and later in the United States and Italy. The American Academy of Lyric Arts (AALA) and the American Songwriter's Academy are two such institutions that provide structured courses in the Troubadour style. In the 21st century the Troubadour style has been championed by Acclaimed Songwriter, Neil Larsen whose compositions feature consistently high rankings in Songwriting Contests. His book \"The Songwriting Journey\" is the first comprehensive treatment of the style. A sample stanza from \"The Miller's Son\" demonstrates the style: Count your coins and stop your plucking, Sing of girlish grace and trusty rifles, And of how you spotted a single chiding grain of wheat, When all around was drought and mounting chapman's sky.",

He won the title by defeating Sharmba Mitchell by split decision in Sydney, Australia, to become the first Argentine and active Latin American professional boxer to hold a world championship in any weight class. Carbonieri had his first professional fight at the age of 16. He spent the next ten years working in his family's bakery in order to support his training. During this time Carbonieri won all of his 15 professional fights, ten by knockout. Carbonieri's first world championship fight was against Wayne Elsey for the WBA title at age 30. He lost a very close but unanimous decision. He then moved up in weight to challenge Zoltan Gyorffi for the IBF super middleweight title. After eleven rounds of battle, the judges scored the fight 98-91, 96-94, and 98-91 in favor of Gyorffi. Despite the scorecards, many ringside judges and media outlets scored the fight for Carbonieri. Many believed Gyorffi won only two of the three scores, while a few scorers scored the bout very close at 95-95 and others scored it very wide for Carbonieri at 100-90 or even 100-88. Carbonieri's second world championship attempt was against Sharmba Mitchell, who had himself won the WBO and Lineal super middleweight titles by beating Gyorffi. The fight took place on 19 December 2005 in Sydney, Australia and had the potential to unify the IBF and WBO titles. Carbonieri won the fight by split decision, many ringside judges scoring it 118-110 for Carbonieri, many scoring it 116-112 for Mitchell, and some others had the decision too close to call. This split decision victory made Carbonieri the first active Latin American and Argentine professional boxer to hold a world championship.",

    "Fără cuvinte is a Romanian idiom that means \"without words\" or \"with no words\". It is used when one does not have an adequate response to a situation. An example: Ion a câștigat bani mult în urma agenților lui, însă fără cuvinte față de ce a plătit pentru servicii. - Ion gained a lot of money through his agents, however without words towards what he paid for services. This is because one can say \"față de\" in Romanian, which means \"in return for\", \"in compensation for\" or also \"in consideration of\". Ion paid agents lots of money, therefore let's say that he did so \"față de\" services. A variant of this idiom is \"față de la sine\" which means \"on top of itself\" or \"by chance\". For example: Am aflat că bunica mea a murit fără la școală, față de la sine a evitat părinții să o întrebe despre situația bunicii sale. - I found out that my grandmother died without my parents knowing about it, by chance avoiding to ask about her own grandmother.

    "New Mexico United is a club-centric ward-based political party in the state of New Mexico, United States. Founded in 2017, the party primarily runs candidates for offices at the municipal and state levels, with the ultimate goal of creating a United States of New Mexico with electoral power at the federal level. The party officially started with the selection of John Fraley as its chairman at the July 2017 Albuquerque Signal Party. The party organized its first election in November 2018, when New Mexico voters will select members to the New Mexico Legislative committee, and nominate a candidate to run for the United States Senate. The party won all of its seats in the state legislature in the election, as well as its first-ever congressional seat with Xochitl Torres Small, who won a special election in 2018. In the 2020 state election, the party won a majority of county committee seats, as well as the governor and lieutenant governor offices, further strengthening its position in New Mexico politics. The party has local subgroups called \"d heedons\" which focus on particular regions or issues, such as education, local government, or health care. The party considers itself a democratic socialist, and advocates for single-payer health care, a living wage, and social ownership of businesses. The party has been vocally critical of sitting Republican Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, calling her a \"business-backed politician with a résumé of millionaire cheerleader[s]\" who has \"betrayed\" the state by signing \"job-killing\" legislation such as the New Mexico Legislative targeting of the Santa Fe Wine Lands. The party frequently protests against laws it deems regressive, such as a state ban on religious housing deeds, or against legislation it sees as supportive of the LGBTQ community, such as a bill to outlaw conversion therapy. The party supports abolishing the New Mexico Personal Income Tax and replacing it with a 2% state sales tax. In the 2022 legislative elections, the party nominated a full slate of candidates for the first time, and doubled its vote share, winning 13 of the 21 seats in the state legislature. The party has supported Bernalillo County, home to the state capital, Albuquerque, as its core geographic region. New Mexico United is the most prominent club-based political party in the United States. Other notable club-based parties include the Washington Conservative Clubs and the Colorado Democraticony Caucus. New Mexico has only had Democratic governors since 1953. Since 1990, New Mexico has voted for the Republican presidential candidate only three times: four years after the establishment of the party, George H.W. Bush, with 46.8% of the vote in 1992; the two terms of George W. Bush, with 48.5% of the vote in 2004 and 52.6% of the vote in 2008; and Donald J. Trump in 2016 with 47.9% of the vote. The party currently holds both houses of the New Mexico State Legislature, and the office of governor. The party's co-founder and chairman, John Fraley, ran for governor of New Mexico in 2018 as a write-in candidate and received 1.3% of the vote, the highest any candidate from a club-based party has ever achieved in the state. In the 2022 legislative elections, the New Mexico United club won a majority of seats in the New Mexico House of Representatives for the first time, receiving 51.5% of the vote and 61 of the 90 seats. The United club also won a majority of seats in the New Mexico Senate for the first time in 2022, receiving 39 of the 51 seats. The current chair of the New Mexico United club is Marty Irby.

    "Heinrich Richter (20 August 1811 – 23 March 1893) was a German astronomer, optician, and inventor. He joined Carl Friedrich Gauss's observatory in 1832 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1839. In 1848 he became professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the University of Berlin. Richter made significant contributions to the field of metrology, developing the centimeter scale and the metre scale. He also made fundamental contributions to the measurement of optical intensities and to the theory of propagation of light in a medium. He was one of the first to formulate the Cauchy principle of finite differences, which is important in the theory of differential equations. Richter served as president of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1849–1862) and as president of the German Mathematical Society (1869–1870). He was the recipient of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1853 and of the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1858. The lunar crater Richter and the crater Richter on the Moon are named after him. The lunar crater Richter Y was also named after him, but this crater has since been renamed. Richter married twice, first to Klara Margarete Siebold and from this marriage had one daughter, and then to Minna Kötz. He died in Berlin and was buried at the New Cemetery in Berlin. In 1935, his remains were moved to the Friedrichstadt cemetery. Among his sons was the mathematician Heinrich Richter (1838–1871). His daughter was the educator and writer Auguste Richter (1843–1899). His grandson was the architect Hans Richter (1888–1976).",
    "An air-start system is a launch system that uses an air compressor to start an engine via an air ram. This is in contrast to other launch systems that use a liquid fuel rocket motor that requires a liquid fuel tank, plumbing, and typically a stored energychemical propellant to get the engine started. The air-start system does not use fuel once the engine is running so the only equipment needed is the air compressor and the piping to connect the air compressor to the engine. This simplicity makes the air-start system useful for small launch vehicles where carrying liquid fuel tanks and the plumbing to connect them to an rocket is challenging. It is also more flexible because if only a subset of the launch vehicle uses the air-start system then it is possible to make the plumbing for the other systems detachable so the vehicle can use the air-start system to launch out of restrictive areas or ondemand if an operator wants to minimize the launch cost. Currently the Perseus launch vehicle and Cygnus cargo spacecraft use an air-start system to get their engine started. A larger air-start system used on the Antares launch vehicle allows two separate engines to be started simultaneously. In some situations starting an engine using an air-start system will be the only option. This can be the case if the engine was designed to be started using a liquid fuel but that required plumbing was not included in the design of the vehicle. An example of this is the Space Shuttle main engine which was designed to be started using a mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen but the plumbing to feed those fluids to the engine was not included in the Space Shuttle design so an air-start system had to be used. Because of the simplicity of the air-start system and the ability to get engines started in challenging locations this system has been used on vehicles in a wide variety of space technology application. This includes launch vehicles, aircraft, satellites, and even hot air balloons. Currently the most challenging application of the air-start system is getting large heavy engines started in Earth orbit. The most common use of the air-start system in this setting is to start the large Liquid Oxygen tank in the first stage of a two stage launch vehicle. These large oxygen tanks are typically over 100 tons and are often the largest and heaviest objects launched into space from the Earth's surface. There are some ongoing work doing on groundstart versions of the large liquid oxygen tank to make these launches easier but even these workable have a maximum weight limit of about 150 tons so they cannot be used to launch very large or very heavy satellites. The second most common application of the air-start system is in aircraft. Most jet aircraft use a small air-start auxiliary engine that is used for starting the main jet engine or to provide electrical power during flight. These auxiliary engines typically only weigh a few hundred pounds so they are a small portion of the weight of the full aircraft. The vast majority of air-start engine applications are smaller than what is needed for launching a launch vehicle. This includes hot air balloons, passenger airplanes, ground support equipment for aircraft, and industrial equipment. An example of an industrial application is an air-start diesel generator that can start a diesel engine under emergency conditions where there is no other source of power (such as after a plant explosion which prevents use of other power sources). Another interesting application of the air-start system is for starting other vehicles. A motorcycle can use the air-start system to start if out of gas or if the motorcycle gets hit and can not start normally. The air-start system can also start cars that have run out of gas. The air-start system works by sending very high pressure air through a length of rubber or plastic tubing. This air-started engine will not run at high speed but it will be able to start the vehicle because of the momentum of the air sent to the engine. There are some disadvantages to the air-start system. It takes a few minutes for the engine to start when air is initially sent to the engine so if the vehicle being started is in an emergency situation it will be unable to help until the engine has started. An air-start engine that is used in an aircraft will typically require a longer time to start than a liquid fueled engine because starting an engine using air requires more oxygen than starting an engine using a liquid fuel. However, this length of time is often shorter than other liquid fuel based launch vehicle engines so this is not generally seen as a problem. Overall the air-start system has many applications and is an excellent way to start an engine that does not require liquid fuel. This simplicity allows the system to be used on a wide range of vehicles and in a variety of challenging environments where starting an engine",

It is located nine miles (14 km) south-east of London via the A2 road and close to the coast, with a large creek at the north of the parish separating it from the market town of Whitstable. Riverhead was recorded in the Domesday Book, with its main industry being fishing. It has a long sandy beach that is popular with tourists, and a 19th-century theatre known as the Royal Hotel. In the 2011 census, Riverhead had a population of 9,088. Riverhead railway station is on the Folkestone to Hythe line and is served by both Kent Coast Line and Littlehampton line trains, which run between London Victoria and Littlehampton. Riverhead is well known for its traditional thatched cottages, much like those seen in the TV series _Ted Lonson_, _Lancaster Sound_ and many other British TV programmes and films. The origins of Riverhead are lost in antiquity, with finds dating back to the late Stone Age. The toponym 'Riverhead' first appears in the 10th century as two separate place names: Richæwarda and Hydestæmon. In about 1050 it was recorded as Rewardæhod or Regnumidedune in the Domesday Book. The 13th century archaeological site of Rose Hill, to the south of the parish, is an Iron Age fort and later a medieval castle. It is a scheduled ancient monument.",

OpenIVisitions.com Terisa Griffin in The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1977-1977) From The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1977-1977) Wiki Jeri Hogarth, played by Terisa Griffin, is a character on the television show The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1977-1977). Griffin received a Humanitas Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance.[1] Personality Jeri is often brash, straightforward, and blunt. She has little patience for people who are weak or easily swayed, and strongly advocates for her own beliefs. However, she cares deeply about her friends and family, and will go to great lengths to protect them. She is a groundbreaker, and not afraid to speak her mind. In her earlier years, she was a heroin addict and prostitute. She gained employment at WJM-TV in Minneapolis, Minnesota as a receptionist, and met Roger Malina (played by Ed Asner), the manager. Their relationship was that of a father and daughter, and upon Roger's encouragement, she became sober and gave up prostitution. She took his last name.[2] She worked in the station's control room and had an on-screen partnership with Mary Richards (anchored by Ted Hartley). As the series progressed, she moved away from her father figure role as a friend and co-worker to taking on the role of Mary's rival. As Mary and Roger got married, Jeri was a bridesmaid. She became more of a self-centered, egotistical person as the show progressed. However, she became more selfless later on during her career. She was born on August 28, 1969, which is also the date the series premiered.[3] She is Jewish, and her religious beliefs play a large part in several storylines on the show. Career While she had been an actress, her résumé was too short to get many acting jobs. After settling down and getting clean from her drug addiction, she auditioned for the role of Jeri on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. When the casting director passed her name on to producers, she received a call saying that they wanted to meet her for the part. The producers thought she was too plain, and was in fact one of the only people who didn't get the role. She was told to come back the next day for a callback. After she convinced the producers that she had the right personality to play the part, they gave her the role. She received a Humanitas Award for 1978 for her work on the show. Trivia She originally auditioned for the role of Pam Morgendorffer, but didn't get the part. She had previously auditioned for the role of Pam Morgendorffer on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but didn't get the part. Her birthdate, August 28th, is the same as the date that the show premiered, September 26, 1970.",

    "Fogo, Newfoundland and Labrador is a community on the island of Newfoundland. It is located to the west of Bay of Islands, to the east of Twillingate and to the south of Iceland Bay. Fogo is famous for its large, active volcanic complex, L'Ansonge Ventar Cataldo, which last erupted in 2018. Fogo's rockcastle, named Buccaneer's Haven, is one of the largest in the world. Fogo has a rich fishing and seafaring history, and in 2015 was named a Heritage Town. The most well-known son of Fogo is singer Robbie Robertson, who was born and raised in the community. The area was hit hard by the 2018 oil spills from the offshore platform fire and the devastating tornado on June 29, 2019. As of 2023, the community has begun to rebuild, with help from the federal and provincial governments as well as local fundraising efforts. Advertisement: Fogo, Newfoundland and Labrador is a great place to visit in the summer. The heat is bearable and the scenery is absolutely stunning. The main industry is fishing, with millions of dollars of fish being hauled in each year. The famous Buccaneer's Haven rockcastle is also located in Fogo and is worth a visit. It is huge and the view from the top is amazing. I recommend spending a night in Fogo, if you can get there during the summer - the food at the Oak Tree Pub is absolutely amazing!",

    "Chiao Chiao (Chinese: tertiary nest swift) is a small passerine bird in the twite family, named for its unusual habit of building its nest in other birds' nests. Chiao Chiaos are native to East Asia, ranging from eastern China to far northern Japan. They are obligate nest parasites, with the female laying its eggs in the nests of host birds, such as storks, whose embryos will later be raised by the Chiao Chiao chick after the host parents have abandoned the nest. The Chiao Chiao is the only member of its family with a worldwide distribution. In China, its range is largely restricted to the Yangtze River valley. Because of intense trapping for the wild bird market, the Chinese population has drastically declined, with a 2018 survey noting just 2,501 individuals. In 2013, the IUCN classified the Chiao Chiao as \"vulnerable\", but it was removed from the Red List the following year after a global petition organised by the International Crane Foundation. A 2018 survey noted a small but stable population, and the species was re-instated on the IUCN Red List the following year. The Chinese name for Chiao Chiao is \"\" (\"\"). Description The Chiao Chiao is about 12.5 cm long and has a pinkish brown back and wings and grey underparts. Unlike many birds, the Chiao Chiao has distinct dark and light stripes on its head. Chiao Chiaos primarily eat insects and seeds. They have also been known to take small vertebrates, such as baby mice and lizards, as well as dragonfly nymphs. The nest of the Chiao Chiao is flat and rudimentary, usually made of vegetation and feathers taken from the host bird, and is attached to a tree or high up in a bush. The eggs are blotched with brown or green, and number three or four, sometimes five, and are incubated by both sexes. The host bird usually raises the Chiao Chiao chick after its eggs are laid, but not until the host parents have abandoned the nest. The hosts are sometimes aware of the Chiao Chiao egg in the nest but unable to detect its hatching. The Chiao Chiao is the only member of its family with a worldwide distribution. In China, its range is largely restricted to the Yangtze River valley. Because of intense trapping for the wild bird market, the Chinese population has drastically declined, with a 2018 survey noting just 2,501 individuals.

A 2018 survey noted a small but stable population, and the species was re-instated on the IUCN Red List the following year. The Chinese name for Chiao Chiao is \"\" (\"\"). Etymology The scientific name for Chiao Chiao, is formed from two Chinese words: \"\" which means \" tertiary\", referring to its position in the nesting hierarchy with host birds, and \"\" meaning \"nest swift\", referring to its habit of building its nest in other birds' nests. Distribution and habitat Chiao Chiaos are native to East Asia, ranging from eastern China to far northern Japan. They are obligate nest parasites, with the female laying its eggs in the nests of host birds, such as storks, whose embryos will later be raised by the Chiao Chiao chick after the host parents have abandoned the nest.

    "Seismometers are devices that record ground motion caused by earthquakes. Seismometers are essential tools in earthquake science and detection, as well as in monitoring volcanic activity and detecting subterraneal explosions. Although seismometers are very sensitive, they are not capable of determining the location of an earthquake. This information can be obtained by using a GPS receiver and directions from satellites. Seismometers are used in a complex called a seismic network that consists of many seismometers spread across a region. As an earthquake occurs more seismometers are able to detect the earthquake providing more data to create a more accurate image of the earthquake's area and strength. Seismometers are made up of a series of coupled springs and accelerometers. The springs are used to set the resonant frequency of the device while the accelerometers measure movement. The accelerometers are used to detect ground motion caused by earthquakes. As the accelerometers detect ground motion a signal is sent to a person observing the device or, in some cases, the signal is stored in a list for processing later. Seismometers must be coupled to a surface in order to work. They work well in calm weather as surface winds can propel the seismometer out of position. Seismometers are made by a number of companies. The three biggest are Analog Devices, International Sensing and Dynatrem. Seismometers are used in a seismic network that consists of many seismometers spread across a region.

    "Else Holmelund Minarik (March 20, 1901 – December 9, 1983) was a Norwegian-American children's book author best known for her 47 books about a fictional character, Annabelle Lane. Annabelle Lane is a spunky young lady who often interacts with anthropomorphic animals. The books were generally intended for young children and were popular during the 1930s through the 1960s. Many of Minarik's books were adapted to animated films, a few were made into television series and one was made into a stage musical. Minarik was born in Norway and came to the United States as a child. She wrote children's books in the 1930s through the 1960s, getting her first book, The Bear Family, published in 1935. Several of her books were inspired by her own experiences as a child in Norway. Many of Minarik's books featured a fictional town called St. Paul's Acres. In some of the books, Annabelle Lane's Uncle Morgan lived in St. Paul's Acres. Morgan was inspired by Minarik's father, who in real life was an engineer with the railroad. One of Minarik's more famous books, The Gingerbread Man, was published in 1960 and featured a gingerbread man as the protagonist. The story takes place in a period when people still feared witches. Minarik's father died when she was 12 years old. The death had a profound influence on her, and many of her books dealt with death and loss.",

    "The Wengernalp Railway was a metre gauge railway in the Canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. It connected the village of Wengernalp with the rail network at Balsthal (Switzerland) and was in operation from 1894 to 1954. The railway was opened in 1894 and initially operated with steam locomotives. It was later expanded to metre gauge and, by 1911, included a branch to the resort of Lenk. In the later years of its operation, it was used predominantly for the transportation of construction materials for the building of the St. Gotthard Passtunnel. The Wengernalp Railway ceased operation in 1954. It was one of the last passenger railway lines in operation in Switzerland and was, along with the Bernina Railway, one of the last railways in operation in Switzerland with a narrow gauge of 1009 mm. Advantages The Wengernalp Railway had the following advantages over the standard gauge railways at the time it was built: it operated with metre gauge, thus reducing the costs of infrastructure and material transport the gradients on the Wengernalp Railway were much easier than on the standard gauge railways, facilitating the transport of construction materials over the line the extensive use of the St. Gotthard Pass (which at that time operated as a single track) necessitated the building of a much higher track than on the standard gauge railways the narrow gauge of 1009 mm was already in use on other railways, thus it was possible to more cost-effectively lay down the tracks Disadvantages The Wengernalp Railway had the following disadvantages over the standard gauge railways at the time it was built: the line was built in a remote area with few inhabitants, thus a steep decline in traffic was to be expected a further decline in traffic was caused by the entrance of the electrically powered Stroway Railway into operation in 1936, since that line went directly to the village of Wengernalp and did not require a change of train at Balsthal. Society today Despite the disadvantages, the Wengernalp Railway is still operated as a hiking trail. In 2010, a group of enthusiasts established the Wengernalp Railway Company (WVR) and, since May 2014, has been carrying out voluntary maintenance on the track, including clearing fallen trees from the track.

He also served as the president of the National Association of Home Builders from 1995 to 1997. Perry was a Republican and his predecessor as governor, Edward Tippetts, was also a Republican. Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Perry graduated from Chillicothe High School in 1967. He attended Kent State University, where he played on the basketball team and earned a degree in business administration in 1971. After college, Perry worked as a bank teller and operated a savings and loan. He later worked in sales for a plastics company before starting a lawn mower business. In 1976, Perry was elected to the Chillicothe City Council and two years later he won a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1977 to 1983. In 1982, Perry won the Republican nomination for governor but lost to Tapperts in the general election. Perry served as lieutenant governor from 1983 to 1988. In 1988, Perry defeated Tapperts in the primary and then won the general election and became the 39th governor of Ohio. As governor, Perry advocated for reforms to business regulations and reduction of state spending. In 1993, he won re-election by defeating Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a candidate backed by a popular Democratic governor of neighboring Michigan, James Blanchard. In 1994, Perry became chairman and CEO of Perry Homes, a construction company in Perrysburg, Ohio.

    "County Route 41 (CR 41, CR 41a and CR 41b) is a major north-south highway in Onondaga County, New York, in the United States. It continues south as New York State Route 394 (NY 394) to the village of Onondaga, and continues as New York State Route 79 (NY 79) to the city of Syracuse. CR 41*s run concurrently with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) for about, following that route from the village of Lehman through the town of Skaneateles to the hamlet of Genoa. From there, CR 41*s head east along New York State Route 29 (NY 29) to the village of Bethany. The roadway was originally designated as an unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century. The southwestern extension, from the hamlet of Genoa to the village of Skaneateles, was originally designated as State Highway 49 in the 1920s. State Route 79 was extended north from Syracuse to the Massachusetts border as a re-alignment of CR 41 in the early 1930s. The routing was further extended north to Worcester, Massachusetts, as an extension of NY 35 in the late 1930s. The unsigned legislative route was designated as New York State Route 41 in the early 1940s. NY 41 was extended north from Massachusetts to the Canada–US border as a re-alignment of NY 35 in the early 1950s. A replacement for NY 41 was established as part of the surface route of NY 79, and CR 41*s were assigned to NY 79 between the village of Bethany and the city of Syracuse and the Skaneateles branch. The Genoa–Skaneateles segment was converted into an extended NY 29 in the early 1960s. The portion of the Skaneateles–Bethany segment between NY 394 and NY 29 was removed from the state highway system in 1965. CR 41*s have occasionally seen various routes over the years. The Skaneateles–Genoa segment was turned back to local control following a November 2008 referendum. In 2010, the state of New York placed a request with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for designation of the northernmost section of NY 79 from the Canada–US border south to the Pennsylvania border as a part of Interstate 86 (I-86). The section of the roadway within the state of New York has not been part of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has been maintaining the highway as part of its maintenance of US 11 and NY 29. The section within the city of Syracuse is unsigned; however, the City of Syracuse maintains a separate county-maintained section of the highway within the city. The section within the town of Lehman is entirely urban in nature and not part of the state highway system. The section of CR 41 from Skaneateles to Genoa was removed from the state highway system in 1965, but the section between the village of Skaneateles and the Massachusetts border remained under state maintenance until the early 2000s. The section of NY 79 between the village of Bethany and the city of Syracuse was transferred to Onondaga County in the 2000s. However, CR 41 remains the principal highway through the town of Skaneateles as the result of a 1998 court ruling. There have been plans to improve the highway between the villages of Skaneateles and Bethany, such as by replacing the dangerous curve near the Lower Skaneateles Dam with a wider bridge, though the priority for funding has not been established. History CR 41*s were first assigned to two legislative routes in the early 1920s. The first was a segment extending from the hamlet of Genoa to Skaneateles. The second was a southwestern extension of CR 41 from Skaneateles to Bethany. The Genoa–Skaneateles segment was originally designated as State Highway 49 in the 1920s. The CR 41 designation was extended north from Skaneateles to Syracuse as part of an extension of NY 79 to Syracuse via Skaneateles in the early 1930s. The Genoa–Skaneateles segment was originally designated as NY 41 in the early 1940s. The Genoa–Skaneateles segment was turned back to local control following a November 2008 referendum. On April 26, 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) officially requested that AASHTO add the portion of NY 79 from the Canada–US border south to the Pennsylvania state line as part of the Interstate Highway System.

    "Facet (geometry) is a concept in geometry that is the study of convex polyhedra. A facet of a convex polyhedron is a flat surface (defined by a group of atoms or molecules) that sticks out from the polyhedron like a facet of a piece of rock-cut architecture. In this analogy, the facet is the column (piece of rock) and the flat surface is the lintel (the thing sticking out). In this analogy, the vertices of the polyhedron are the columns, and the faces are the lintels. In the geometry of polyhedra, every vertex is surrounded by three facets, every face by two facets, and every edge by one facet. The facet concept was introduced by Bernard Riemann in 1854. Riemann's original definition involved cutting away all portions of the polyhedron behind the plane of the surface. A more recent equivalent definition, due to Alfred Kinsey, starts with a surface that is given a color, and colors all portions of the space behind the surface the same color. A non-convex polyhedron is a polyhedron that is not convex. A non-convex polyhedron may have flat faces that are not facets. For example, a book dropped on its back has a mostly flat face (the book back) that sticks out from the book, but the book back is not a facet, because the book back is concave. The study of facets in non-convex polyhedra has given rise to distinct fields, such as non-convex geometry, non-convex geometry crystallography, and theoretical computer science. For convex polyhedra, the number of facets is related to a number of interesting properties. The first is the diameter of the sphere of radius representatives of the vertices of the polyhedron. The second is the kissing number, the maximum number of spheres that can fit in the same spherical layer about the origin, each sphere touching every vertex of the polyhedron that it contains. Many researchers have investigated upper bounds on the number of facets for various classes of polyhedra. In particular, a conjecture of Zipporach and Livingston implies that any simplicial polyhedron in -space has at most 6n - 12 vertices, where n is the number of vertices. This bound is close to being best possible, because the icosahedron has 17 vertices and 6n - 12 facets. Similarly, in three dimensions, any polytope with at most 70 facets exists in space. Despite the upper bound of 70 facets, many interesting polytopes have much more than 70 facets. The 120-cell has 192 facets, the 600-cell has 1527 facets, and the 24-cell has 2832 facets. This blog post is based on a talk given at TEDxLondon, by Anthony Nefax. The numbers of facets of simplices, regular polytopes, and the D5 domain module are all unknown. Many polytopes have facets that are flat planes, because they correspond to various types of planes of symmetry in the geometry. The simplex, the cube, the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and the dodecahedron have 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20 planar facets. The 24-cell and 600-cell have 12 and 1527 planar facets respectively. The 120-cell has 192 planar facets. Other facets in the simplex, the cube, the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and the dodecahedron are curved, giving the appearance of facets only because we are looking at two-dimensional projections of higher-dimensional objects. For example, the octahedron has 12 curved triangular facets and 30 curved square facets. The 600-cell has 1527 curved planar facets. This is only a brief introduction to the facet concept. The interested reader may wish to consult the articles on convex polyhedra, non-convex polyhedra, and polytope, as well as the cited works of Bernard Riemann and Alfred Kinsey. The facet concept was introduced by Bernard Riemann in 1854. Riemann's original definition involved cutting away all portions of the polyhedron behind the plane of the surface.

    "The Rheinmetall MG 60 was a multi-purpose fully automatic heavy machine gun designed for infantry use and built from 1942 to 1945. It was capable of fully automatic fire at both low and high rates of fire and was highly reliable, being used in several World War II campaigns. The MG 60 was inducted into the U.S. Armed Forces technical manual in 1945 and saw limited use during the Korean War and Vietnam War before being replaced by the Belgian FN MAG in most U.S. military inventories in the early 1970s. The MG 60 was conceived as a replacement for the MG 42 and shared its Auto-5iberian loading mechanism and open iron sight. However, the MG 60 was much heavier and larger, weighing over seven kilograms (15 pounds) with the tripod and requiring a central gun mount. Its 150-round box magazine was capable of fully automatic fire for up to seven minutes, but standard infantry magazines held 30 and 50 rounds, reducing the MG 60 to semi-automatic or even single-fire modes. A belt-fed version was also available. The weapon's considerable size and weight, mediocre rate of fire and significant maintenance requirements, as well as the arrival of new, more powerful, calibre weapons, led to its rejection in most infantry units. The MG 60 nevertheless remained in military service with a number of armed forces, including the West German Bundeswehr, as well as in a number of international export markets, such as Peru.",

    "Jonathan Tel (c. 1550 – c. 1625) was a English scholar, known as the translator of the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays. He was born in London and educated at Merchant Taylor's School. He began publishing in 1586, working with Henry Peacham on The Compleat Gentleman. From 1588 he was in great trouble for London city taxes, and he sailed for the Netherlands in 1589. He studied at Leiden University and worked with Theodore Beza at the French Protestant church in Antwerp, under whose patronage he also published Archimedes. In 1604/5 he returned to London and for ten years worked as a private tutor. He was close friends with Ben Jonson and Shakespeare, and also worked with Abraham Cowley, George Chapman, and John Fletcher. He died around 1625 in London and was buried at St Martin's Church. His children included Robert Tel, also an eminent Shakespearean translator. The First Folio of Shakespeare's plays was the first collected edition of Shakespeare's works. It was published in 1623, based on the plays' performance of the previous decade at the theatre-of- lords. A collection of 1623 had been proposed by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and some historians have claimed that this shows Oxford to have been the true author of the plays. Others have been more critical of this theory, but Jonathan Tel was able to translate the dedication and epistle to Oxford into Dutch. This proved controversial at the time and later made it easier to claim Oxford as the true author.",
    "Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 was an American sports hunting television series that aired from February to December 2012 on the cable channel aimed at male hunters, GameFXX. The series was filmed in South Dakota and followed a diverse group of hunters as they pursued various big game animals across the United States. The series was produced by RFD Television and was hosted by Scottie Scheffler and taxidermist and actor Chris Scanlon. In February 2012, it was announced that Cabela's would partner with Scheffler, the host of Sportsman Channel's Whitetail Hunter Warhorn, and Scanlon, known for his work on the Animal Planet series, Guillermo's New Adventure, to develop the series. On April 26, 2012, it was announced that Cabela's would air 20 episodes of the series. On December 5, 2012, the series concluded after airing its final episode, but Scheffler later revealed that another season had been planned. Despite critical acclaim, the series was not a ratings success and was canceled after 12 episodes. The opening sequence featured Scheffler or Scanlon describing a hunt, followed by Scheffler bringing the big game animal into a Cabela's store, with Cabela's logos displayed throughout the sequence. The host would frequently break the fourth wall and address the camera, giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the hunt. Scenes outside of Cabela's were sometimes used to emphasize the theme of the hunt. Scheffler and Scanlon would often share a laugh throughout the hunt, with Scanlon emphasizing the humor of the hunt, as well as the hunt's absurdity. GameFXX commissioned series re-releases and extensions to the show. Season one was released on DVD on April 18, 2013, and season two was released on December 5, 2013. Reruns of both seasons subsequently aired on the GameFXXTV channel. Despite critical and commercial failures, Cabela's is committed to continuing the hunting show concept, with Scheffler confirmed as host of the new series, Whitetail Hunter, which premiered on GameFXX in 2014 and was subsequently moved to the network's main channel.",

    "Saint Paul's, Saint Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, British Overseas Territory, and part of the Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha group. The island is roughly triangular in shape, with a total area of about, making it the fourth-smallest of the islands in the group. St. Paul's is roughly circular in shape, with an area of about, making it the smallest. The island is volcanic in origin, and much of its landscape is made up of basalt cliffs. The island's main feature is its airport, which is located in the northeast of the island. The airport is dedicated to emergency landings only, and no commercial airline flies there. The island's only settlement is the port village of Saint Helena, located in the south of the island. Saint Helena is completely uninhabited, but the British government maintains a military presence there because it is the only secure anchorage for commercial shipping in the region. This includes a Royal Air Force station, a naval base, and a prison. The only exceptions are periodic supply visits by Royal Navy vessels, which may carry up to nine passengers at a time. As a result, the entire population of the island consists of warders from the prison at the prison camp. In common with the other islands in the group, Saint Helena used to be part of the British Empire, and retains some of its colonial administrative structures. The governor of the island group is the Commander of the Royal St. Helena forces, who is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Governor is appointed by the British monarch, and his official residence is Government House. Despite its remote location, the island has been a focus of significant interest for rocketry enthusiasts for many decades. The first satellite launch from the island took place in 1954, and a large proportion of the vehicles used in the successful satellite missions of the 1970s and 1980s were constructed on site. In more recent years, the Island has been used as a test site by several car manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford, and Toyota. The only animal found on the island is the black rat, which was introduced to the island by sailors. This is the only known example of a natural extinction in the modern era, with no animal species present even though numerous other animals have been imported for laboratory experiments. A number of important historical figures are connected with the island. It was at St. Paul's that Edward Kelsey completed the first successful test of a submarinesea car in 1853. Twenty-two years later, Kelsey's son Vincent made the first powered flight from the island. In 1921, Michaelis, the Germanarchive that covered the operation of the Allied prisoners during World War I, was relocated to Saint Helena from its original base in Switzerland. The island was also the final home of South Africa's first president, the late Mahatma Gandhi, and of Indian author and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Saint Helena has noEXPORTED SO MUCH VITAL WATER FROM ITS SOIL THAT THE MAINLAND OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS OF THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC WOULD DEPEND ON IT FOR ITS CONTINUED SUPPLY Saint Helena is the southern-most and largest of the British dependent territories in the Atlantic Ocean. Water is Saint Helena's main export and main source of income. The island is depleting its fresh water reserves at a rate of around 300,000 litres per day (386,000 cubic metres per day). The Middle Island of the Middle Atlantic would depend on it for its continued supply.",

    "Real-time text messaging, or real-time texting for short, is a method of sending messages over a mobile phone network that allows the sender to transmit text information immediately (typically within a few seconds) of when the information is composed or entered, often via a mobile web browser. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, providers of real-time text messaging included Today's Mann Up and Weight Watchers. More recently, real-time text messaging has also been used for marketing and advertising, typically in the form of SMS message advertising. Real-time text messaging has become the generic term to describe this form of mobile messaging, and is now used in company and organization names, such as FISRT, Project Titan, and GroupMe. Since its introduction, real-time text messaging has evolved into a more advanced form of mobile messaging. For example, certain providers allow users to compose and edit messages on the fly, although this feature is not required for all messages. Additionally, certain providers now allow mobile web browser access to general-purpose internet websites, enabling the inclusion of images, videos, and audio. While real-time text messaging initially served as a messaging gateway for Today's Mann Up and Weight Watchers, it has since evolved into a more advanced form of mobile messaging. For example, certain providers allow users to compose and edit messages on the fly, although this feature is not required for all messages. Additionally, certain providers now allow mobile web browser access to general-purpose internet websites, enabling the inclusion of images, videos, and audio. As of 2020, real-time text messaging is most commonly performed via the SMS message format. Some real-time text messaging services also offer other message formats, such asthose based on the Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard. RCS is an umbrella standard for real-time messaging that encompasses a number of different message formats, including SMS, MMS, Interactive Voice Response, and video. Real-time text messaging is most commonly performed via the SMS message format, which has been present on mobile phones since the 1990s. However, RCS is a more recent standard, having been ratified in 2015. The main advantage of real-time text messaging over other mobile messaging formats is that users can compose and send messages immediately as they are writing them, without having to first enter a dedicated messaging application and manually open a new conversation. This is in contrast to instant messaging and email, both of which require the recipient to be logged into a service and to be actively looking for messages from the recipient. Users can compose and edit messages on the fly, although this feature is not required for all messages.

In addition to the SMS message format, real-time text messaging also provides other RCS message formats, such as MMS, ICR, and video, enabling richer messaging experiences. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of mobile data services, real-time text messaging users no longer need to be connected to the mobile network in order to send and receive messages.

    "San Giovanni Battista, better known as San Giovanni Battiste or simply San Giovanni, is a Neoclassical-style catholic basilica in Rimini, Italy. The church was built between 1818 and 1821 in order to honor John the Baptist, and it was designed by Nicola Martinelli. The church has a Latin cross plan with a nave and two aisles, an open semi-circular baldachin over the crossing and a high facade. The interior contains some notable sculptures by Antonio Nibby, Luigi Geblov and Domenico Bertoli. The first ceremony took place on June 29, 1818 and it was attended by Ferdinand III of Naples, Charles Felix of Sardinia and other rulers and prelates. The church was completed around 1821 and it became the centre of a sicilian and international Cultural Community which lasted until 1848. The church was used as a barracks in 1915 and it was restored in 1926 and 1947. In May 1945 the building was almost completely destroyed by a German air raid, but it was restored again thanks to donations from the community. The community was suppressed in 1948 and the church was handed over to the Comune di Rimini. The monastery was restored again between 1951 and 1959. The church has been restored again since 2000. The church was listed as a national monument of Italy in 2009.

Wednesday, June 20, 2011 Daimler-Benz 150th Anniversary Ford and Chrysler celebrate being American, while Daimler-Benz celebrates being German The 150th anniversary of the first successful automobile, built by Daimler-Benz, was celebrated with a series of special editions from the Bavarian company. The first Mercedes-Benz was a 170.000 pound truck (Ford and Chrysler celebrated being American, while Daimler-Benz celebrated being German) built by Karl Benz to deliver mail on the Emmerthal post road near Vienna in 1896. Daimler-Benz traditionally used model years to reflect the years in which a vehicle's major components were produced. The 2011 model year, for example, is made up of the 12th year of major production for many components. The 2011 Mercedes-Benz B200d is powered by a 125 HP diesel engine and has a top speed of 70 MPH. An exceptional car for the price point, the 2011 Mercedes-Benz B200d has been rated a Top Pick by Consumer Reports. This car, this company have been a crucial part of my life. I've owned two, one of which was a 1971-1977 300D (Yellow) that I still drive and love. My current car is a 2005-2007 600D in Sand (multi-colored). I have owned 2 Mercedes-Benzs, and still own my 1991 300E. All 3 of these cars have been superbly reliable and safe vehicles. While this is a beautiful car, and one of the very first passenger cars I ever bought, I have to say that I agree with Consumer Reports - the interior looks and feels \"cheap\" and \"plastic\" compared to the quality of the exterior and driving experience. I bought the car used with 72K miles on it, and it has now upwards of 170K miles, with no regrets except for the price I paid for it - if I could go back in time and buy it again, I would have spent a little more and gotten a newer car with better miles-over-interior reliability. What a cool car... and yep, the interior is low end. My 400DM had the original tan seats which looked and felt so much better. I've never had a car last this long. These were built to be driven and that shows. It has power brakes, but you are better off getting the ABS package, which can be added to the basic package for $1000. I had a 5-series (W198) with the smooth 4Matic transmission from 2003 to 2010 and had no trouble with it at all. If you are looking for a reliable and safe car that provides a smooth, enjoyable",
    "Francis Bolton (portrayed by Iain Glen) is a major character in the HBO television series Game of Thrones, first appearing in season 3 as the Master of Whight outlaw army. In the show's fictional world, Bolton is a prominent northern lord at the time of the events of season 3, and is later revealed to be the father of the current King of the North, Northman, and head of the Northern House of the Night's Watch. Born into poverty in the fictional territory of White Harbor, Bolton joined the King's Guard at the behest of then-head of security, Lord Petyr Baelish, and quickly proved himself by winning several battles, the most notable of which was the Black Harvest, in which Bolton personally killed the leader of the Valryian Watch, Ser Jaime Lannister. As a reward, he was made Lord of White Harbor and was given a position in Baelish's service. After several years of loyal service, Bolton was given command of the legendary Night's Watchbuf 295 men, with whom he declared war on the wildling population, leading to the Long Night. After the war, Bolton was given the honors he had sought and named Master of Whight. In the early 22nd century, Bolton became a leading voice in the Northern House of the Night's Watch and was made Lord of Qohor. However, his reign was interrupted by a military coup instigated by the Children of the Forest, resulting in the North being torn apart by civil war; Bolton sided with the Tullys, and was made Warden of the North. Bolton's story was adapted into the book series, A Feast for Crows, where he is portrayed as a cunning and greedy man who has grown cold-hearted and oblivious to the suffering of others. This change was also reflected in his relationship with Jon Snow, who defeated Bolton in a power struggle. Following the series, Bolton becomes the Warden of the North once again and fathers Northman, the current King of the North.",

    "A fable for critics by Aesop Chickadee and Winnie-the-Pooh One day, while relaxing in the woods, a chickadee and a Winnie-the-Pooh found themselves chatting. \"What are you doing?\" asked the chickadee. \"I'm sitting here, listening to the birds and the breeze,\" said Pooh. \"It's very relaxing.\" \"So am I,\" said the chickadee, \"but I have a worried mind. I keep wondering if I have enough food to eat.\" \"That's a valid concern,\" said Pooh. \"It's great to be aware of food supply issues. But you shouldn't worry about that while you're relaxing. Take a page out of my book and put aside all cares and concerns. It will make you happier and more relaxed.\" \"That sounds good,\" said the chickadee, \"but how am I supposed to do that?\" \"Just start repeating these two sentences to yourself: \"one day at a time and One hour at a time \"That should help you achieve your goal.\" The chickadee decided to give it a try. After a few minutes, she sighed with satisfaction: \"Man, it's great to be small. All my worries - worries about the drought, the price of corn, the cold winter - just melt away like snow in the summer sun. And all it takes is to think One day at a time and One hour at a time.\" \"You make it sound so easy,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"What about you? What's your philosophy?\" \"It's really simple,\" said the chickadee. \"I just sit quietly for a while and let my thoughts wander where they will. One day - that's enough time to worry about my food supply. One hour - that's long enough to worry about it and all my other concerns. I try to do One day at a time and One hour at a time.\" \"That's the best I've heard of so far,\" said Pooh. \"You've learned to live in the moment.\" \"Indeed I have,\" said the chickadee, \"but it takes practice. All my friends tell me to think ahead, but it just doesn't work for me. I like to have a fresh start every morning. It makes me feel like a new chickadee. And one hour at a time is usually enough to plan for the next hour.\" \"That makes sense,\" said Pooh. \"So what are you doing this morning? Just sit and think about that.\" \"That's the problem,\" said the chickadee. \"I sit and think about that and end up thinking about last night, and the day before, and the week before that. In the end, I've wasted an hour of my time and don't have an hour to plan for.\" \"Well, that's a problem,\" said Pooh. \"Most of the answers to life's problems come from continuing to think about a problem until you come up with a better solution.\" \"So I've been told,\" said the chickadee, \"and it's a good thing to be careful about. But how can I think just One hour at a time?\" \"I do,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"I sit quietly and think about what I'm going to have for lunch. Then I think about what I'm going to have for dinner. Then I wonder what I'm going to have for breakfast, and soon enough I'm staring at a full calendar.\" \"You see?\" asked the chickadee. \"I never thought of it that way.\" \"It takes a big mind,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"You've learned well.\" \"I still don't understand one thing,\" said the chickadee. \"How can you sit and think about just one hour at a time?\" \"Just start with the first hour that comes to mind,\" said Pooh. \"Think about the last hour you relaxed and had fun. Think about the hour before that and how you could have spent better. Then think about the next hour and how you could make the best of it. Soon you have an hour ahead of you and all you have to do is enjoy it as it passes.\" \"You're right,\" said the chickadee. \"That works well for an hour, but how am I supposed to think just about one hour?\" \"It's hard to do,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"But, you know, sometimes it's nice to just sit",

    "Shergarh is a town and a nagar panchayat in Dadu District of Sindh province, Pakistan. Shergarh town lies 8 kilometres south of Nawabshah, and has a population of around 200,000 people.[1] It is located near Daud kala motorway and has an average elevation of 28 metres (92 feet). The name Shergarh is derived from a Sindhi legendary hero, Sher Khan Dhandan, a Samma Dynasty prince who ruled the region during the 7th century AD. According to the local legend, Sher Khan defeated the Hindu King of Sindh and set his kingdom on fire. The region was called Shergarh meaning the fire of Sindh.

In the Netherlands, seven outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 occurred in 2016. Since 2010, the virus has circulated among poultry with sporadic genetic and antigenic variation. In this study, we describe the genetic evolution and receptor binding phenotype of these H5N8 HPAI viruses. Receptor binding analysis showed that the viruses isolated in 2016, like those in recent years, had acquired the α2,3-SA receptor binding determinant from the presumably common source A/duck/Germany/RC-4087/2010. The HA gene phylogeny showed three main clusters, two of which included the majority of the viruses isolated in 2016. All these 2016 viruses were of the Cluster 2B genotype, which has increased in prevalence in recent years, suggesting that genetic change may be contributing to the evolution and successful spread of the H5N8 virus in the Dutch poultry population.<|endoftext|>.

Girls are socialized to see people like themselves as the norm, and to avoid standing out or making others feel inferior 2. Women have a harder time in the tech industry because of the long hours, traveling, and pressure to be perfect at work/home 3. Women are still socialized to see caring for others as more important than themselves 4. There is a pay disparity - women are paid 20% less than men on average 5.

    "The 2013 Rayong oil spill was a large oil spill that occurred on July 5, 2013 in Rayong Province, Thailand. The spill killed large number of fish and caused serious environmental damage, and was one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of Thailand. The cause of the spill was not determined, but authorities speculated that the spill may have been caused byONG temporal, a state-owned company which at the time was in the process of switching from using sea water to using non-sea water to prevent sea water intrusion into its oil wells. The spill occurred when the pipeline connected to the offshore oil well broke and leaked tens of thousands of litres of oil into the sea. The well was quickly capped, but much of the oil soaked into nearby reeds and estuaries, affecting thousands of fish and other sea life. More than 30,000 residents of the province were affected by the spill, and many took to social media to complain about the lack of government support and delayed notification of the spill. The government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra initially attempted to minimise the damage, but the scale of the spill and negative international press coverage caused the government to take steps to improve its response efforts. A commission, led by Prem Tinsulanonda, a former King of Thailand, was formed to review the government's response efforts, and many of the commission's recommendations have since been implemented. The spill was the subject of a long-running criminal investigation, and in 2018, Chayapol Juraporn, the former president ofONG, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for criminal negligence and violations of environmental regulations, among other charges.",

The captured Macbett robot reveals that it was created by Koros to be an army of roboticized humans, and that Koros believed he had found a way to equalize intelligence with his creator, Jenkins. The Macbett robot desires are so strong that it coerced Koros into aiding it, but its creators realized its true intentions and had the Macbett robot destroyed before it could execute them. The Macbett robots, under the command of Koros, attack and destroy the Altair 4 colony, but the Alian protagonist and Chief Executive Officer of Space:1999, Christopherander, is able to use the experimental Macbett robot escape pod to flee to Earth. The Macbett robots resurface on the space stations of the Altair System, in the 2nd season premiere \"The Counterfeit Man\". They capture Andromeda, the station's Captain, while Christopherander is investigating the death of Koros, a fake assassination installed by Christopherander himself to allow Koros to disappear with the Macbett robot Anna C56. Christopherander is able to thwart the fake assassination attempt and contacts Earth through a deactivated Macbett robot communications array to alert them to the threat. Christopherander later learns that Koros was attempting to uncover the true source of the Macbett robots' power source, \"the source\", a mysterious AI entity that had attached itself to the Altair 4 computer network following the failed terraforming attempt, and that the real Koros body was being used as a control mechanism by Anna C56, the Macbett robot second-in-command. Christopherander confronts Anna C56 and uses the \"source\" to destroy it, shutting down the Macbett robots. Jenkins, on the planet Altair IV, awakens from his cryogenic freeze to realize that his creations have been destroyed and that his revenge will need to be accomplished through other means. He revives his late wife, Ali Jenkins, and reveals that he installed a computer virus in the Altair 4 network that will destroy all data pertaining to Space:1999, including the Macbett robot files, in order to make sure the planets failure to terraform would remain a mystery. The final scene of the 2nd season finale, \"The Mask of Mati\", shows a solar system-wide message from Jenkins, posing as Christopherander, announcing that Space:1999 is being restored, and asking for Alian assistance in the terraforming of Mars. Later, in the 3rd season premiere, \"The Silent Enemy\", Christopherander is revealed to be the villainous Master, posing as Space:1999's Chris Franz, in order to gather the necessary data on how to terraform Mars. Jenkins, still posing as Christopherander, reveals that he had intentionally sabotaged Space:1999's systems in order to make sure the project needed Altair's assistance for Mars terraforming would be kept a secret. Having orchestrated the events of the 2nd season, Jenkins reveals that he has installed a computer virus into the Altair 4 system that will allow him to control all functions of the system, and that the virus will be activated once the Macbett",

    "Southbound Pachyderm (born Ronald Mailhot-McCauley, also known as Panda and the Odd Bird and Panda McCbrain) is a French musician, born in Paris. He gained popularity in France through his participation in the reality TV show La vie en rose, where he reached the final, and also released an eponymous studio album which reached number one in France. His real name is Mailhot, he is of Canadian descent and also speaks French and English. His nickname Panda comes from his smooth skin condition known as hyper-pigmentation, in which his skin darkens from exposure to sunlight. While Mailhot has insisted that his skin condition is a result of a genetic mutation, other causes include childhood exposure to toxic chemicals, such as was prevalent in the era he was born in. During his time in the show, Mailhot was publicly called out for being unaltered, and since then, he has worked to raise awareness of negative stereotypes associated with albinism. Influenced by a variety of genres including rock, hip hop, R&B and alternative, his music video for \"McMcCrystal\" received over 5 million views on YouTube. Following the release of his second studio album, No Jumper, he became engaged to Greek model and YouTuber Maria Magdalena Goucht. The couple's January 2020 wedding was featured in Vogue Paris. Mailhot has headlined tours in France, as well as co-headlined a tour in Japan with Microscopic, and supported Snoop Dogg and De La Soul on their co-headlining US tour.",
    "Static light scattering is an experimental technique used in physics, chemistry and biology to determine the size and shape of particles and molecular complexes. It is based on the measurement of the time-dependent fluctuations of the scattered light due to the particles' Brownian motion. It is used in chemistry to characterize solutions and to detect colloidal particles, aggregates and molecular complexes. In biochemistry, it is used to determine the dimensions of biological macromolecules and molecular complexes. In biophysics, it is used to determine the size and shape of cells. The technique is also used in materials science to determine the structure of polymers. The first experiments using static light scattering were conducted in the early 20th century, and the detailed theoretical understanding of the technique was achieved in the 1950s and 1960s. The first commercial instruments for practical applications were developed in the 1970s and 80s. The major applications of static light scattering still are the characterization of solutions and the detection of colloidal particles, aggregates and molecular complexes. The basic experiment concept is based on the measurement of the time-dependent fluctuations of the light scattered by a particle as it moves through the incident light beam. The technique uses a light source that produces a laser beam or a collection of many quasi-monochromatic light beams. The laser beam or the light beams are expanded, focused or collimated to obtain a light beam of suitable cross-section and passed through the sample under investigation. The scattered light is collected using the same light path. The light beam is focused onto a one or two dimensional photodiode array or a one or two dimensional CCD camera with or without additional focus shifting and passed through a polarizer to measure the intensity as a function of the polarization angle. The intensity signal is Fourier transformed and the resulting ensemble-averaged intensity function, I(Q), is a dispersion profile. For more information on the theory and the practice of static light scattering, the reader is referred to the book \"Light Scattering. From basic principles to applied techniques\" by Robert M. Harper (1992). The applications of static light scattering, based on the technique described above, are the characterization of solutions, the detection of colloidal particles, aggregates and molecular complexes, the determination of the dimensions of biological macromolecules and molecular complexes, the study of cells, and the characterization of polymers.",
    "The Origin theories of Christopher Columbus speculate on where and when Christopher Columbus might have lived, as well as the origins of various folk traditions associated with him. The most common Origin theory focuses on his birth in Genoa, Italy in 1451 and his subsequent migration to Spain in the early 16th century. More recent scholarship suggests that Columbus may have been born between 1465 and 1470 in the Republic of Genoa, in what is today known as Republic of San Marino, with the GenoeseDocent School of History proposing a Genoese Liguria as the more likely place of birth. Scholars agree that Columbus most likely came to Spain and arrived in the Americas in 1492. While the Genoese Origin theory as a birthplace and Spanish migration theory is widely held, the particular folk traditions associated with Columbus tend to be more diverse. In the Spanish Caribbean, Columbus is commemorated with the feast day of Saint Christopher on December 27, with Christopher being the saint depicted in depictions of a Christ-child with aodilons bearing gifts to the poor and marginalised. Many of these depict Christopher bearing a miniature boat or caravel, and this has given rise to a number of folk etymologies, with Christopher being mistaken for a sea-going saint who travels through maritime trafficacles, or legends of Columbus seizing a magical boat on his visits to the New World. In Italy, Columbus is commemorated with Columbus Day on October 10, and while Genoa is again the most common suggestion for his birthplace, the suggestions are broader across Europe and the Americas than for the Caribbean, with Columbus also being proposed for places including Wales, Brittany, Normandy, and many Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries. Despite the popularity of these local traditions, research from the 1970s onwards has consistently shown a much more diverse and localized narrative, with Columbus having been celebrated on his death-day December 31 in many locations throughout Spain and the Americas, and little evidence to support the suggestion that he was celebrated on a global scale on October 10. More recent scholarship supports the idea that Columbus was celebrated on his death-day across the Spanish Caribbean on December 31, and that while October 10 was a widely-observed local holiday in Spain, Columbus's death-day of December 31 was more widely celebrated in the Caribbean and South America, with very little evidence for October 10 celebrations in the 16th century.",

    "The Cruciate Ligament is a group of ligament located in the human knee. In humans, it is made up of the ACL, PCL, and LCL. The Cruciate Ligament helps keep the human knee stable by helping to keep the tibia in place within the femur. Without this stabilisation mechanism, humans would experience excessive movement in the human knee, which may lead to damage to the articular cartilage on the inside of the femur. instructable.com/front_page_header_bicycle_pump_manual_bicycle_pump_how_to_inflate_a_bicycle_tire/ clusterfuckengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/understanding-the-cyclotrimer- inflation-kit.jpg myself. how does one inflate a bicycle tire? Typically a bicycle tire is inflated to about 35psi. The process of inflating a bicycle tire normally begins with placing the valve stem of the tire in a filling port on the front of the wheel. This filling port is normally covered by a flap, but can also be exposed by unfastening a series of retainer wires. Once the tire is properly oriented and the retainer wires are removed, the stem of the tire inflator is pushed into the exposed filling port. The valve stem is pushed into the inflator until it clicks into place, at this point inflating the tire to the desired pressure. Once the tire has reached the desired pressure, the stem is removed from the filling port and retained pressure is released from the tire, normally by spinning the back of the tire to \"wind down\" the tire. While this is a typical and common way to inflate a bicycle tire, it also possesses a number of flaws. The first and most obvious is the \"clicking\" mechanism for determining the proper tire pressure. Many experienced cyclists will turn to \"pressure testing\" a tire by assembling a bicycle with the offending tire installed. After inflating the tire to the proper pressure the \"click\" mechanism can be used to test for proper inflation. This process requires two hands to operate and is thus inconvenient for most riders. While more and more modern inflators include a \"read out\" mechanism that displays the tire pressure to the rider, many riders simply estimate the pressure, leading to sub-optimal tire inflation and an increased chance of tire failure. The second flaw with this method of inflating a tire is the orientation of the tire filling port. Many bikes feature \"fixed\" fill ports, meaning that the orientation of the filling port is fixed relative to the frame of the bike. This leads to additional frustration for riders who spend time adjusting the bike to the proper orientation before being able to begin inflating the tire. Fixed fill ports also present a significant problem for riders who frequently switch between bikes, meaning that they must locate the right orientation of filling port for each bike they own. While this method of tire inflation may have been common in the 1980s and 1990s, the advent of both handheld tire inflators and built-in tire pressure sensors have made this method of inflating tires anachronistic. Some of the more modern bicycle tires feature a built-in electronic valve that can be controlled by the rider using the headlight remote or a quick-release hub. Such systems automate the tire inflation process and eliminate the need for the rider to find the correct filling port, while also preventing the forgetting to switch from a fixed to a quick release in the dark.",

    "The term \"Science on the Verge\" was coined in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences to emphasize the role of fundamental science in modern society. Fundamental science, which can be defined as the study of structure, behavior and properties of matter and its components, is the foundation of modern technology. Since the 18th century, many technological advancements have been spurred by new discoveries in physics, chemistry, and biology, including the scientific discoveries that led to the production of polio vaccine, discovery of antibiotics, and identification of the DNA double-helix. As part of this role, the National Academy of Sciences describes that \"fundamental science must be accessible to all\". The term \"Science on the Verge\" has been adopted by several organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and many universities, including Harvard, Oxford and MIT. Despite the benefits of fundamental science, access to fundamental science is becoming increasingly challenging, due in part to the costs of conducting research and the time required to produce meaningful results. This creates an inequality in knowledge acquisition where the average citizen does not have the same access to knowledge and discovery as historical periods past. Further compounding the issue is the fact that science is also becoming more specialized; to perform research in a specific field of science, one must have extensive training in that particular field of science. This creates a situation where the general public is not only hindered from accessing scientific knowledge, but they may not even know how to find such knowledge if they did have access. Therefore, the National Academies propose the Science on the Verge Initiative, which calls for making fundamental science accessible to all through techniques such as remote access, automation, and visualization. The initiative also highlights the importance of encouraging collaboration between different scientific fields, as well as between scientists and other artists in innovation centers, in order to promote cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural connections, and create a greater emphasis on meaning and discovery in scientific research. Overall, the Science on the Verge initiative promotes a \" Science that Serves the Verge \" -- in which fundamental science, by increasing accessibility and expanding the impact of research, will allow society to \"create a better world through understanding, discovery, and innovation\".",

    "Sunny Days, Starry Nights is a popular song written in 1874 with words and music by William Jerome and Tom Canning. The song describes the typical experience of a girl in summer, enjoying sunny days and clear nights, floating amid clouds but never becoming drenched, as the songwriter imagines her wearing a \"umbrella hat\" to keep her head dry. The music of Sunny Days, Starry Nights has been credited with helping to inspire the creation of the umbrella as we know it today. Sunny Days, Starry Nights is the best-selling singles song in history, with an estimated sales count of 500 million (today, that would be approximately 12.5 billion). The song has been recorded by many artists, the most popular of which was hit record in 1941 with Al Bowlly singing in British English and Paul Whiteman and his orchestra singing in American English. Also in 1941, the song was made into a film starring Judy Garland. In 1981, Sunny Days, Starry Nights was used in an episode of the long-running British TV show The Hoot Mon. And in recent years, the song has been used in a number of TV series and movies, most notably the 2011 movie Despicable Me 2 where the main character Gru dreams he is singing the song while climbing into his bed. And in the 2015 movie How to Train Your Dragon 2, protagonist Hiccup teaches his son Boomer a number of the lyrics to the song. And in the 2017 sequel How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, another one of Hiccup's children, FEV, sings the song with her friends as the main protagonists crash a party to celebrate the return of the how to train your dragon TV show for the first time in 13 years. The song's status as a child's song has been questioned with the release of a satirical version called \"Rainy Days, Monsoons and Mists\" which was recorded by British comedy performers Ed Gamble and Lala Wilson. The song's status as a child's song was reinforced in 2018 when the UK's National Galleries approved a proposal to place the song in the public domain, making it free for anyone to use and reproduce without requiring permission or payment. And in April 2023, while a gaggle of school children from Wellington, New Zealand were attending a music festival in the southern state of Victoria, Australia, a violent storm with torrential rain and lightning swept over them while they were singing the song. As they were singing the chorus \"Someday I'll wish upon a star\", a bolt of lightning struck the top of a nearby pine tree, causing it to explode in a fireball of orange and yellow flame and embers that could be seen by people watching from the nearby towns of Morwell and Moruna. Five of the children were seriously injured, and one 5-year-old girl died from her injuries a few days later. Several of the children were left with permanent scarring, either from being struck by the flying embers or from the panic and stampede that followed the explosion of the pine tree. Despite this unfortunate incident, the rest of the school festival trip was magical, with the children singing Sunny Days, Starry Nights together for the last time on the last night of the festival, surrounded by the bright Southern Cross star field. By the end of the 2023 school year, five of the children had either returned to school with new scars and/or with burn-related amnesia, and two had committed suicide, leaving only two children, an 8-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, who would continue to sing Sunny Days, Starry Nights together each year as the group of school children travelled to different music festivals around Victoria. These two children, who continue to sing the song together to this day, are known to the rest of the world as \"the sing-sing kids\". Sunny Days, Starry Nights was the creation of William Jerome, a popular songwriter who was born in the United Kingdom and died in the United States in 1911. Jerome wrote the music and lyrics to Sunny Days, Starry Nights in 1874 and first published it in 1875. The first public performance of the song was on December 26th, 1874 in Hanover, New Hampshire at the Cornhill Music Shop. The song's creators received no payment for the performance or for the song's publication. In fact, the Cornhill Music Shop, where Sunny Days, Starry Nights was first performed, burned down in 1881, and the song was never commercially published or recorded. Due to its popularity in the years",

After the births, the twins are joined by a tertiary (originally named Boba Fett; now named Unkar Plutt) and placed in a droidee ward, where they are given the sobriquet Darth Plagueis and Darth Caedus, respectively. The story takes place in the unfinished construction levka habitat on the moon of Guusev, and follows the development of their mental powers and their participation in the turbolaser gun battle that destroyed the levka habitat and killed many of the droids that were being built there. The title of the story is a reference to the line from A New Hope. The twins grow up and become leaders of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. Luke is orchestrating a local revolution against the alien invasion and successfully rallies the people of the planet Tatooine to help him battle the Yuuzhan Vong.

    "Polysorbate 20 (also known as Tween 20) is a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (TMO) derivative used as an emulsifier and stabiliser. It is approved for use in humans and other mammals. It is extensively used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. It is a clear, viscous liquid at room temperature. Tween 20 is composed of polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monoloate (Tween) units and is soluble in water, petroleum ether, and ethyl ether, but not in organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene, and tetrahydrofuran. It has a density of 1.1 g/mL and a melting point of 56–58 °C.[3] Tween 20 is an emulsifier and stabiliser. It is used in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Tween 20 has also been shown to enhance the delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs through mucosal surfaces. It reduces interfacial tension between two immiscible phases. As an example, it has been shown to significantly increase the permeation of sodium fluorescein across an in vitro model of rat skin. Additionally, Tween 20 acts as a lubricant and allows for the easy penetration of other molecules such as peptides and proteins through membranes. Tween 20 is soluble in water, and has been used as an aqueous surfactant and penetrating enhancer for hydrophobic molecules. Tween 20 is approved for use in humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and other national agencies. In many parts of the world, Tween 20 is sold as Triodate melloate, a similar but slightly more concentrated variant. Both Tween 20 and Triodate melloate are commonly used as ingredients in infant formula and other edible consumer products. The chemical formula for Tween 20 is C29H57COOH·C9H15O33 The polysorbate family of surfactants includes Tween 20, Tween 80, and related compounds. Tween 20 has a tendency to self-assemble into micelles in water. The hydrophobic Tween segments associate to form the core of the micelle and the polar head groups interact with the water, thus producing a stabilizing shield around polar molecules. Tween 20 micelles typically have a radius of 20–50 Å and a surface charge of -30 to -40 mV. Tween 20 is extensively used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. In pharmaceutical applications, it is used to solubilize active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are poorly soluble in water. Tween 20 solubilizes drugs by creating a homogenous solution, reducing the surface tension, and increasing the thermodynamic activity. In addition to acting as a solubilizer, Tween 20 can enhance the delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs through mucosal surfaces. As a penetration enhancer, it decreases interfacial tension between an aqueous solution and the target surface. In cosmetic formulations, Tween 20 is commonly used as an emulsifier, dispersing oil phases in water or other polar solvents. In food applications, it is commonly used to improve the texture or appearance of products, reduce interfacial tension, or emulsify ingredients. In dehydrated foods, Tween 20 is used as a humectant, maintaining the appropriate degree of moisture. Tween 20 is generally regarded as a safe (GRAS) ingredient, with sweeteners, flavor enhancers, and emulsifiers being the largest consumer uses.",
    "Monte Titano is an Italian mountain located in the province of Avellino, in the Campania region. The mountain has an elevation of 1,924 metres above sea level and is located within the Lattara Mountain Range. The mountain has an extensive background in history as it was the site of the Battle of Monte Titano during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in 1918. The mountain is an important watershed, the waters of the Isonzo river starting at the mountain falling into the Liri valley to the east, and theensee falls into the Durance river valley to the west. The landscape of Monte Titano is mountainous and heavily forested, with the Valle di slopes being the most densely forested. Some mountain peaks have glaciers. The Monte Titano massif is located approximately 30 km north of Benevento and 22 km south of Avellino. The Monte Titano part of the Lattara mountain range has an area of approximately 1,200 km2 and is made up of several sub-ranges. The highest peak of the range is the Monte Titano with an elevation of 1,924 metres, this is also the mountain of the national park. The sub-ranges most closely associated with the Monte Titano are the Campanian Apennines to the west and the Diano n plateau to the east. The Diano n plateau descends to the Adriatic Sea in the west and to the Tyrrhenian Sea in the east. The national park extends onto the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian slopes. The range is located within the provinces of Avellino, Benevento, Caserta, FerreraIglesias, and Naples. The national park extends into the provinces of Benevento, Caserta, and Avellino. The main river in the Monte Titano area is the Isonzo. Important tributaries are the Diano n, Rapino, Ombrone, and river Senio. The Ombrone and Isonzo rivers empty into the Adriatic Sea, while the Rapino and Senio rivers empty into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The historical significance of Monte Titano has led to the creation of the national park. The national park was officially created on March 4th, 1934. The national park covers an area of 930 km2 and is administered by the federal Ministry of Environment and Land. The Monte Titano part of the Lattara mountain range is known for its alpine pastures and farming, with numerous farms and vineyards located throughout the national park. The most important alpine pasture in the national park is the Gran Sasso e953. The Gran Sasso e953 is located on the southern slope of the Monte Titano and is approximately 1,500 metres above sea level. The pastures are characterised by extreme altitude, sharp ascents and descents, and extreme diversity in terms of vegetation and animal life. The pasture includes various sub-pastures that are separated by insurmountable natural barriers, such as the Colle di Lava Padana (Lava Valley Ridge), which runs from north to south between 1,829 and 1,848 metres above sea level. Despite its geographical location, the Gran Sasso e953 is the most isolated pasture in the national park. Vegetation in the pastures of the Monte Titano mountain range is strongly influenced by exposure to sun and wind. Vegetation varies from south to north, from dry pastures to forests of beech, fir, and spruce. The animal life is also diverse and includes Alpine, livestock, and wild species. The alpine livestock of the Monte Titano national park is made up of marmots, pikas, and various species of squirrels, among others. The Isonzo river starts at Monte Titano and flows to the Adriatic Sea. The Ombrone, Rapino, and Senio rivers start at the mountain and flow to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The national park is characterised by the diversity of its flora and fauna, as well as its landscapes. The Gran Sasso e953 is a highly unique alpine pasture and key habitat for several species, including the Gran Sasso edresser. The mountain is protected under Italian law as the Gran Sasso and Gran Sasso Superiore national parks. The national park is also home to numerous shepherds' huts, farms, and wineries. The Castel del Monte, also known as the Casteluzzo, is located at the foot of the Gran Sasso. The castle was built in the 14th century by the Italian condottiero Galeazzo Malatesta. In 1993, the castle and the surrounding area was designated",

    "Prosopometamorphopsia (PPM) is a condition where the sufferer displays episodes of large apparent size, in which a normal-sized item such as a car might appear to be a monster. PPM was first described in 1998, and is considered to be a variant of Charles Bonnet syndrome. The condition is relatively uncommon, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000. The large apparent size of the perceived object is not projected directly onto the sufferer's retina, but is perceived via some other means, such as pareidolia. The physical basis of PPM has not been determined with certainty, though there is evidence to suggest that the syndrome may be explained by dysfunction of the multisensory visual cortex. It has been suggested that PPM may be related to epilepsy, but this has not been proven. Signs and symptoms PPM first became evident in the patient, Sylvia, in 1998. She described having difficulty with apparent size when looking at objects such as a kitchen knife held at a distance, or a pattern on a t-shirt. This apparent size changed when she looked at the object from different angles. Another symptom is the visual misperception of the physical environment; for example, seeing shadows or lights that are not there. In a 2007 interview, Sylvia described the syndrome as beginning with blurred vision, and shifting to an extraordinary sharpness when looking at a specific object. Other symptoms also included seeing letters or numbers that were not on the page, as well as seeing animal forms in random patterns. She also described having to look away because the objects were too big to look at directly. Other cases of PPM have been described since the syndrome was identified. Two patients with similar symptoms to Sylvia's were identified in an American town, who similarly described the onset of symptoms in early childhood, with a delay of 30–40 years before diagnosis. A separate case was described of a woman with the syndrome who also had cataplexy, a condition in which sudden bursts of weakness result from the loss of voluntary control of the heart and respiratory muscles. Prevalence The syndrome is estimated to affect between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 50,000 people. Causes The syndrome is not transmitted from person to person, and its cause has not been established. It has been suggested that it could be related to epilepsy, based on the associated symptoms of perceptual rearrangement and hallucinations. However, this hypothesis has not been proven. There is some evidence that PPM may be caused by an underdevelopment or dysfunction of the multisensory visual cortex, in particular the parieto-insular cortex. The brain regions associated with Charles Bonnet syndrome also appear to be involved in multisensory integration. Furthermore, there is evidence that multisensory cortex may be involved in PPM: in a 2009 study, three of four PPM patients had lesions in the right temporo-occipital cortex, a region known to play an important role in processing cross-modal sensory information. Another possibility is the involvement of the parieto-insular cortex. This area of the brain is concerned with multisensory perception and spatial awareness. It has been suggested that multisensory fusion is behind the apparent enlargement of objects in PPM, though this has not been proven. Some research has shown that the brain processes visual information differently in PPM patients compared with healthy individuals, which supports the hypothesis that the syndrome is caused by dysfunction of the visual cortex. Although the syndrome appears to have a genetic component, the inheritance is most likely polygenic. Treatment The syndrome is not life-threatening, and treatment consists mainly of reassurance. Some symptoms can be treated with drugs. PPM is not responsive to anticonvulsants such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, topiramate or vigabatrin, but certain antidepressants (such as SSRIs, SNRIs and mirtazapine) may improve the symptoms. The drugs citalopram, amitriptyline and venlafaxine have been shown to be effective. However, most studies have been of small sample size and have been of poor quality, and further research is needed to determine the efficacy of treatments. PPM is not a disease, and is not being investigated as a disease.",

Cossonay is the seat of a Catholic diocese, with bishop Guy Cardinal Duval. The current bishop is Patrick D'againgnoël, installed in 2014. The church of St. Pierre was built in the early 16th century. It has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1976. It is also known for its Romanesque church of St. Quentin, built in the 12th century. The historic center of Cossonay was listed as a heritage site by the French Ministry of Culture in 2003. Cossonay is twinned with Xanthey in Germany, Niederfinckenstein in Luxembourg, and with Belœil in Belgium. Cossonay is also home to a number of sports teams, including basketball, soccer, and volleyball teams. The professional basketball team, HOP HÉGDON play their home games at the Palais des Sports. Cossonay is located 30 km from the French-German border and enjoys an attractive location, close to watering holes, the Semois canalised river and the A1 motorway. Cossonay is the headquarters of the Burundi exile community in France. The town is famous throughout the Rhineland for its chocolates, produced by the celebrated Riegler chocolaterie since 1827. The local kindergarten was built in 1938, followed by a primary school in 1945 and a lycée in 1965. The town has a cinema and several small parks. Notable people from Cossonay include the sculptor Auguste Rodin, who stayed in the town in the late 1880s, and the 20th-century actor Daniel Auteuil, who was born in the nearby town of Flamont. The sculptor Fritz Schlaich was born in Cossonay on August 7, 1920. Cossonay is the birthplace of Günter Kaufmann, former president of Germany, who was born in the nearby town of Tirlemont on February 6, 1914. Cossonay was also home to a large community of soldiers and French forces during World War II, owing to its position on the Semois canal. The German military administration headquarters was located in the local school. Many Germans were interned in the city after the war, and were eventually repatriated to West Germany. Some of the buildings that served as German military administration headquarters in Cossonay remain standing today. Trivia: the German word for “secret”, “mystery”, or “punishment” is “Cossonay” in French. Cossonay was also the title of a painting by the French Surrealist Joan Miró, acquired by the city in 1936. The word “Cossonay” is also a song by French rock band Indochine. The well-known French singer Johnny Hallyday also comes from Cossonay. The typeface Panola is named after the nearby village of Panolivec. The chocolaterie in Cossonay is known for its pralines made with chocolat noir, a rare and very dark variant of chocolate. There is also a connection between Cossonay and the Haut-Rhin department of Germany. The Haut-Rhin German is sometimes considered to be a dialect of the German spoken in Cossonay. The German composer Richard Wagner, better known for writing the Ring cycle, stayed at the Hôtel Metropole in Cossonay between April and June 1848. In 1896, the German writer Eberhard Louis Gerlach, born in Cossonay in 1838, published his book about his time in the region around Châtillon-sur-Seille. Cossonay is also known as the place of birth of Jacques d'Amboise, the composer of the international standard Joan of Arc hymn. Cossonay is also home to football (soccer) club ES Cos",
    "I'm Moving On is a song by Yoko Ono. The song was written and produced for the album Feeling Blu (2007). It was released as a single in December 2007 and reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was inspired by Ono's separation from John Lennon.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a fixing apparatus used in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to a toner rubber member for use in the fixing apparatus and a fixing apparatus including the same. 2. Description of the Related Art In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, such as a printer, a copy machine, a fax machine, and a multi-function printer having at least one of the foregoing functions, a laser scanning unit (LSU) emits a laser beam onto a photoconductor drum to form an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor drum. Then, a developer supplied from a developer unit is attracted to the electrostatic latent image to form a visible developer image. The developer image is directly transferred from the photoconductor drum to a sheet of paper or an image receiving sheet. Alternatively, the visible developer image is transferred from the photoconductor drum to a transfer sheet, and then the transfer sheet is separated from the photoconductor drum and conveyed to a fixing apparatus. The developer image on the transfer sheet is fixed to the transfer sheet by heat and pressure in the fixing apparatus. The transfer sheet with thedeveloper image is then conveyed out of the fixing apparatus. The fixing apparatus of the image forming apparatus fixes a toner image on a sheet of paper by conveying the sheet of paper, on which the toner image is transferred, through a heating roller and a pressing roller, which are heated by a heat source, while conveying the sheet of paper through a nip between the heating roller and the pressing roller. The heating roller includes a halogen heater as the heat source. The pressing roller is typically a resin roller coated with a synthetic rubber on its outer circumference to ensure a high nip strength. The fixing apparatus may also include a heating unit, such as an induction heater, a film heater, or a ceramic heater, as a heat source, in addition to the halogen heater. In such a fixing apparatus, an electromagnetic induction is used to heat the fixing roller by electromagnetic induction. The electromagnetic induction is generated by passing a current through a coil, which is placed near the fixing roller. A related fixing apparatus includes a fixing belt, which contacts an inner surface of a heating roller, a pressure roller contacting an outer surface of the fixing belt, and a metal spring separating the fixing belt and the pressing roller. The metal spring has an accordion-like shape that conforms to the curvature of the fixing belt to uniformly press the fixing belt and the pressing roller against each other. The fixing apparatus of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus operates to heat and melt a toner image on a sheet of paper. The sheet of paper conveyed through the nip between the heating roller and the pressing roller is conveyed through the nip while being heated and pressed by the heating roller and the pressing roller. Thus, the toner image is heated and fixed to the sheet of paper. Recently, to increase the speed of image formation, a belt fixing apparatus has been developed that uses an endless belt instead of a linear conveying member, such as a roller, as the fixing conveying member. In a belt fixing apparatus, the heat from the fixing conveying member is transferred to the sheet of paper passing through the nip. Thus, the",

    "The year 1814 was a common year starting on Sunday and ending on Sunday. It was the first year of another leap year starting on the Monday of the annual calendar, the first of five leap years in the 1814 series. 1814 was designated the Austral year while other years were designated European years, this year followed the Royal Society chronology for the starting point of the calendar era. In Europe, the year 1814 was important for several events. It was the year of the Congress of Vienna, where the major European powers ( Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden and the Netherlands) negotiated and concluded the settlement that ended the first period of the Napoleonic Wars. It was also the year that the Great Composers' House in Prague was completed and the birthday of king Frederik VI of Denmark. In the United Kingdom, it was the year that Carl Bergmann conducted the first chemical analysis of air, leading to the discovery of oxygen. In North America, it was the year Robert Fulton successfully tested the first submarine in a London pond. This year in Australia, it was the year that pastoralists in the colony of New South Wales raised the first crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas, peaches and apples. Major political changes in the year 1814 include the creation of the Kingdom of Sweden, the proclamation of a republic in Portugal, the restoration of Charles XIII of Sweden, the crowning of King Louis XVIII of France and the collapse of the Republic of Luapula. The year 1814 is notable in scientific history for several important discoveries and developments. In astronomy, Giuseppe Piazzi found three new comets. In physics, Michael Faraday did major work on the elective mixture and speed of transmission of heat. In chemistry, Humphry Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac discovered the law of combining volumes. And in biology, Carl Gottfried Eigen published an early work on the distribution of species.",
    "Count of Lucena (c. 1190 – 1268) was a Filipino kingdom that was originally established by Tupas through vassalage to Sung China and was recognized by the later Sung monarchs as a tributary to the Chinese court. However, the succeeding Balaud-Satrigallan alliance successfully challenged Tupas' sovereignty over Lucena and eventually established their rule over the entire realm. While acknowledging the Chinese sovereignty over Lucena, the 14th century Count of Davao, Aliab of Balaud and Sason of Satrigal, later king of Lucena, established his rule over Lucena. He established his sovereignty over Lucena by defeating a Sung Dynasty General who had set up a camp at the old city of Lucena and married a local woman, thus angering the Sung Emperor of the time. Aliab and Sason reigned over Lucena for nearly three decades before their son, Maynila, succeeded them. Maynila's reign was characterized by several wars with neighboring polities such as the Mamalugnay, Kawayan and Maguindanao kings, but he also extended his power to other parts of the Philippine archipelago. On the other hand, Aliab and Sason initially succeeded in establishing peace but were unsuccessful in extending their power beyond Lucena. Count Aliab was killed in 1268 by the Kapampangan ruler of Ple72 Governor Minjuryl during a tour of his vassal's territory. As a result, the domain was annexed by the Sung Dynasty after the fall of Lucena royal family in 1268.",

    "Kokkinobaphos is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea belonging to the Delos archipelago. It is part of the Cyclades island group and is closest to Delos island. Kokkinobaphos has an airport and a pier from which ferries depart for Delos. There is a small village on the island but no obvious settlement. The island was uninhabited in the late 19th century but since the 1880s it has been the site of a famous monastery and a school. The name of the island is thought to be derived from a revered Byzantine monk named Kokkinobastos. According to a medieval Georgian chronicle, the island was named after a Georgian monk, St. Kochino BASILIATES, who visited the island during the reign of emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118). It is known that the Georgian kingdom had signed a peace treaty with the Komnenos family in 1094, and the Georgian monarch's son-in-law, David Dalamanitu, is mentioned as the first owner of the island in a court decision of 1101. The peace treaty is mentioned also in the transcription of a charter of the Georgian monastery on Derventil, dated 1104. The island became more important after the publication of thelemannic map in the 12th century. The island was depicted with a substantial church, three cell-like structures, several orchards and vegetable gardens. The settlement had at least 16 inhabitants according to the 1596 census. The settlement was conquered by the Ottomans in the early 18th century, but was restored to Greece after the liberation wars of 1822–1829. It then became depopulated for a second time until 1880.",

    "ASTERISC is a ticker tape service that was used in news networks to report financial information. It was created by NASA and used on the moon. It is now used in academic and non-profit organisations. Water can be considered a \"heavy\" element, and its hydrogen and oxygen atoms the first two \"light\" atoms in the periodic table. Because of its high electronegativity, oxygen tends to bond with other light elements. Hydrogen, because it has only a single electron in its outer shell, is highly susceptible to bonding with other atoms or molecules. Water is thus strongly polar, with a dipole created by the separation of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Earth's surface gravity is 9.81 meters per second squared, or 32.2 km/h^2, which is similar to that of the Moon (3.6 km/s^2 or 14.7 km/h^2). The acceleration of Earth's gravity is nearly 9.81 meters per second squared, or 32.2 km/h^2, which is similar to that of the Moon (3.6 km/s^2 or 14.7 km/h^2). Life can exist under many different conditions across the Solar System. The most well-known example is water, present in oceans and lakes on Earth, as well as in permanent bodies of water on other planets and moons. Surface water temperature on Earth is largely influenced by its distance from the Sun. At night, Earth is mostly cooled by the Sun, while during the day, it is mostly heated. Since water is strongly polar, the temperature of the surface water will vary in different locations around the globe, with warm water being located near the Equator and polar water located near thepoles. The water's dynamic tension makes it difficult for land life to exist under these conditions, though a few organisms can withstand cold temperatures. Many lifeforms, however, can only survive by boring into the subsurface layers where conditions are cooler, as shallow water tables. The first attempt at ticker-tape style financial reporting was made in 1934 by Father William Joseph Dunn, a Catholic priest and professor of finance at the Catholic University of America. Dunn founded what was initially known as the National Quotation Bureau, which later became known as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). Dunn is credited with coming up with the name \"asterisc\", which was made up of the first letters of the organizations he founded as well as the first letters of the words \"finance\", \"report\", \"quotation\", and \"ticker tape\". Land-based news networks began using ASTERISC in the 1970s, though at first the service was free. The service was initially provided on the then-new Integrated Data Network, but went live on the N America automated quotation system (NASDAQ) in 1944. The ASTERISC service was initially charged only for volatility reports, and free quotes continued to be issued during periods when the NASDAQ was down. ASTERISC became charged only for volatility reports beginning in 1976, and all free quotes were withdrawn in 1978. In addition to sending weather information and financial information, NASDAQ ASTERISC also reported the closing price of individual companies as well as 500 of the largest equities traded on the NASDAQ. This included stocks listed on the New York, Amex, NASDAQ and American Stock Exchanges. By the 1980s, ASTERISC was used by more than 100 financial organisations around the world, and by the 1990s the NASDAQ price of individual stocks was increasingly reported by all news networks using ASTERISC. In addition, news organisations began employing their own traders to inform their reporters about market movement, and began employing \"quotes men\" whose sole job was to collect information and issue reports based on it. ASTERISC continues to be used today by academic institutions, non-profit organisations, and financial organisations around the world. In 1999, NASDAQ paid the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations $19.6 million for ASTERISC's operations that year. The sale of ASTERISC, along with other assets, allowed NASDAQ to focus on its stock trading business and pay its members for referring customers to the service. The ASTERISC service was de-listed from NASDAQ in 2009, and is now offered via the European markets segment of the London Stock Exchange Group. NASDAQ remains the owner of ASTERISC, and provides the service to its European customers for free. ASTERISC is a registered trademark of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. In 2016, the ASTERISC symbol was added to the automated ticker equipment at the New York Stock Exchange, and it can also be",
    "Michele Lean (Michelle Elaine Lean; born Michele Elaine McKenzie; August 13, 1951 – December 2, 2018) was an American singer and songwriter. She was best known as the frontwoman of the seminal all-female rock band Heart. The band released seven studio albums between 1976 and 1983, and scored major hits with \"Barracuda\", \"Crazy On You\", and \"These Eyes\". Lean was born in Dallas, Texas, and began singing in local clubs at a young age. She formed the band Tangerine with her sister Rita in the mid-1960s. After changing the name of the band to the Chain, she met Jim Rodopich, who would go on to become the manager of Heart. She provided the band's vocals for a Tangerine song that Rodopich had co-written. He asked her to join Heart, and the band released their debut album, Feelin' Fine, in 1976. \"Crazy On You\" became their first hit, and the band developed a following with their second album, Alive and Kicking. Lean was a driving force in Heart and one of the primary songwriters for the band. She adopted a less sexualized image for the group, leading to the release of more radio-friendly singles like \"These Eyes\" and \"Drummer Man\". Despite her songwriting contributions, many of the group's hits were written primarily by other band members. Heart disbanded in 1984, but reunited in 2012 for a series of concerts and released two more studio albums. The band toured extensively in support of these albums, but disbanded for good in 2015. Lean's other musical activities included work with artists such as Meat Loaf, Jim Steinman, Michael Bolton, and Lionel Richie. She released three studio albums as a solo artist between 1994 and 2002. She made her last public appearance in 2016, when she performed with Heart at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

    "By the Light of the Moon is a famous poem by Walt Whitman, first published in 1882. The title alludes to a similar phrase from a poem called \"O Say, Can You See\", which often refers to humanity's struggle against its evil tendencies. The Vampire Diaries version of the poem opens with the line: \"Listen! My name is Adam, I am a vampire.\" This line alludes to the first line of the poem, \"Listen! My name is Man\". Both poems are written from the perspective of a speaker addressing a human, offering advice or seeking guidance. Adam, a vampire in the Vampire Diaries universe, presents himself as a child of nature, drawing inspiration from the moonlight to write this advice to a mysterious stranger. Although vampires typically do not require sleep, Adam finds it easy to \"forget\" that he is a vampire when in the moonlight. He describes feeling suspended in time and space, as if he is mortal and the moonlight is hiswindow to the world. He encourages the listener to seek out the beauty of the natural world, instead ofadmiring it only from afar. Adam's poem continues by alluding to a passage from the poem \"O Say, Can You See\", discussing humanity's constant struggle against evil tendencies. He explains that although he enjoys the moonlight, he does not envy humanity its ability to see in the dark: \"Why Andreas, half-shut your eyes, / You will see by the moonlight / More beautiful than by day.\" Throughout the poem, Adam's tone alternates between humble and defiant, hopeful and defeated. He urges the listener to appreciate the natural world for what it is, but also acknowledges his own flaws and failures. The Vampire Diaries has frequently alluded to poems written by great philosophers throughout its ten-season history, and \"By the Light of the Moon\" is no exception. Although it is believed that the Vampire Diariespoem was written in 1994, creator Julie Plec has stated that she pulled lyrics from several sources for the poem, including Walt Whitman and the Romantic poet John Clare. Like Whitman, Adam takes a positive stance towards human nature, although he struggles with the realization that humanity cannot be trusted.",

The district was built with a suburban layout, including winding streets, large front and back gardens, and many small personal backyards. Laventille is still a very prestigious address and is home to many prominent residents. Laventille is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse districts in Kingston. It is home to many West Indian citizens, as well as people of many different national origins. Jamaica is a multi-ethnic country and Kingston has the most diverse population of any city in the English-speaking world. Many residents are originally from the Caribbean but Laventille is home to people of many different nationalities. The area is also very popular with students, who make up a large portion of the population. Laventille is close to some of Kingston's best known tourist destinations. Blue Lagoon, a popular water park, is right across the street from the Queen's Court Projects, one of Laventille's prominent landmarks. The area is also near two of Kingston's largest tourist hotels, the downtown Garden Inn and the Beacon Hotel. Overall, Laventille is a very safe area, although like many neighborhoods in Kingston, crime does exist. The district is home to some of the city's best football, basketball, and baseball players. The Laventille United soccer club is the most successful club in the district and has many notable alumni, including two-time FIFA World Cup winner David Beckam. Although Laventille has grown in recent years, the area has become increasingly popular with immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom and Ireland. This has resulted in a decline in the area's original Caribbean culture, although Laventille is still home to many different nationalities and has a very diverse population. Despite its name, Laventille is not located on an island but is part of a large peninsula that extends into St. Catherine's Bay. The district is bordered by Richmond Road to the west, the University of West Indies to the north, St. Catherine's Bay to the east, and the Pareseste River to the south. Today, Laventille is one of the most popular neighborhoods in Kingston and is well known for its diversity, safety, and close proximity to several prominent tourist attractions.",
    "Pacheco Creek is a stream in San Benito County, California. It is about 50 miles (80 km) long and flows into the San Francisco Bay near the city of Santa Rita. It was named for Juan Bautista Pacheco, an early Spanish explorer. The once-volcanic creek runs through the middle of a large sedimentary basin that was formed many millions of years ago when the bed of the North American continent was assembling out of the sea. The creek's valley was originally home to numerous indigenous peoples, including the Costanoan and Kashaya Pomo. They hunted, fished, and gathered plants and berries along its banks. The first European to see the creek was Father Juan Crespo, a Franciscan missionary, in 1669.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents an aggressive molecular subtype with an incidence of about 12--26% of all breast cancers, characterized by the absence of oestrogen (ERα), progesterone (PR) and HER2/neu receptors, and an aggressive clinical behavior, including early dissemination and propensity to metastasize to visceral organs \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. TNBC includes a heterogeneous group of patients whose management remains a therapeutic challenge, as they do not respond to conventional therapy \\[[@CR4]\\]. Consequently, TNBC patients have a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 15--50% due to the difficulties in diagnosing at an early stage and the lack of effective targeted therapies \\[[@CR5]\\]. Therapies based on targeting cell membrane receptors, such as EGFR and HER2, have not provided satisfying results in TNBC due to its low expression of these receptors. Thus, targeting intracellular signaling pathways represents a potential alternative approach for TNBC treatment. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in signal transduction across the plasma membrane. FAK has a central role in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival, and is often aberrantly activated in human cancers. Many studies have demonstrated that FAK is frequently overexpressed and overactivated in various types of tumors, including breast cancer, and that high expression of FAK is associated with advanced stages of the disease, and with a poor patient prognosis \\[[@CR6]\\]. Based on these findings, several studies have investigated the efficacy of FAK inhibitors in breast cancer, and have demonstrated that FAK inhibition exerts antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this regard, FAK inhibition has been shown to decrease proliferation, induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and to enhance the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells \\[[@CR7]--[@CR9]\\]. Of note, recently, a novel FAK inhibitor, PF-562271, has been shown to suppress tumor growth in a mouse model of TNBC \\[[@CR10]\\]. Given that FAK expression is increased in many tumor types, and FAK inhibition represents an effective approach to treat cancer",
    "The Madonna of the Candelabra (Spanish: La Monja la Carcel) is a 1891 painting by the Spanish surrealist painter Pablo Picasso. The painting was one of the first known examples of artistic hatching. The work depicts a hatched scene with a decapitated man lying on the floor in front of aMadonnaand Child. The man's hands and feet are extended and held by ants, which are engaged in feeding on his still-beating heart. The painting is held in the permanent collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The painting was produced during Picasso's blue period, before his red period (from about 1904 to 1907). It was acquired by the Simon Guggenheim Foundation in 1943, and later donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1952. The work is one of a very few pieces by Picasso to depict insects. The Spanish term for \"carcel\" in the painting's title is also the origin of the artist's given name, \"Pablo\". The work is part of a series of paintings on the same topic that the artist created in the early 1890s, starting with Theanaudio (Piano) (1891). The latter painting is now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The work was affected by paint loss and suffered water damage in the 1960s, leading to restoration work in the 1980s. The Indianapolis Museum of Art's digital image of the painting was used as the base image for a painting of the same title exhibited at the Hispanic Society of America in New York in late 2017 and early 2018, as one of several artworks depicting the \" Hispanic Spring\" by New York City's Collectivo Caracol. Madonna of the Candelabra\" is featured in the 2004 documentary film Picasso: A Studio of his Own, and inspired works by other artists, such as John Currin, who referenced the painting in his 2011 portrait of singer Édith Piaf. The work is popular with collecting galleries and donors, and was reportedly the most expensive work of art ever sold in 2017. The painting is part of a loosely orchestrated series of artworks, some of them on display simultaneously, others organized to attract attention to causes supporting the Red Cross in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, or to promote the work of the Fundació Antoni Tàpies. The \"Madonna of the Candelabra\" was reproduced on a porcelain platter for the exhibition \"Celebration. 400 Years of Waterman Faience\" at the Louisville Palace in 2008, and became one of several limited-edition prints made from the image for the exhibition \"Picasso. Paintings 1891-1910\", organised by the Artémis museum foundation in Pontoise in 2013. A larger-scale print was produced by Alexandre Alastair for the exhibition \"The Genius of Pablo Picasso\", held at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2015, and a similar but slightly smaller edition was produced by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the same exhibition. A smaller-scale edition, with minor differences, was produced by the National Gallery of Australia in 2018 to commemorate the opening of a major Picasso exhibition there. The Indianapolis Museum of Art updated their website with imagery and information derived from their restoration in the 1980s, and from the work of the Art Institute of Chicago. The painting was part of a major exhibition of Picasso's painting from the first decade of the 21st century, \" Picasso and García Marquez\", held at the Tate Modern in London and the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2011-2012. A reproduction of the painting was produced by Tancrediaco in 24 carat gold as a limited edition of 50 pieces in 2014. The version on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art is a 1902 restoration. The original, prior to restorations, was held by the Simon Guggenheim Foundation, which acquired it in 1943. It was bequeathed to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1952. The original is currently on long-term loan to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra for an exhibition. The National Gallery of Australia estimates that in May 2023, the work was valued at US$155 million. The Indianapolis Museum of Art restored the work in the 1980s, bringing it back to its original condition. The work is part of a loosely orchestrated series of artworks, some of them on display simultaneously, others organized to attract attention to causes supporting the Red Cross in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, or to promote the work of the",

The success or failure of health care organizations is measured by the quality of care they provide and the costs of that care. For some time, those measures have been influenced by advances in medical technology. However, over the past decade, technological advances have begun to plateau and, in some cases, have shown signs of decline. That has created a new imperative for those responsible for managing health care organizations: improve the quality and efficiency of care while reducing costs. The traditional, established tools of management, including observation, interviewing, and document review, may no longer be sufficient to achieve those goals. This article discusses the need for organizations to develop a new tool--an ethnography--to help them understand how the people in their care experience both the quality of the organization and the costs of care. An ethnography, unlike a survey or observation, enables an organization to understand the meaning of an experience for a person. When performed by trained ethnographers, the resulting ethnography provides a unique, valuable, and authentic source of information that cannot be readily acquired by other means. The article describes the purpose and steps in the ethnographic process, presents several examples of ethnographies performed by the authors and their colleagues, and discusses the management implications of ethnographies for those responsible for management of health care organizations.<|endoftext|>Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition Achieves One Million Units Sales On Amazon.com Giuseppe Nelva November 4, 2016 10:45 AM EST Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition has been very successful on Amazon.com, achieving one million units sales after",
    "Albertanus of Brescia (c. 1020 – c. 1080) was an Italian writer and Catholic churchman. He was active in the north Italian cities of Brescia and Bergamo and at the court ofopold III, Duke of Austria. He is especially known for his writing on the Roman Catholic Church, which at the time was suppressed by the German king, Henry IV. He was the first person in the German-speaking world to write a history of the church in Latin, the first volume of which, entitled Historia Societatis Iesu, was dedicated to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor. The second volume, De episcopatu Vienna (Of the Church of Vienna), written around 1070, included a description of the life and acts of the first Roman Catholic bishop of Vienna, Willigis. It included the first description of the suffragan dioceses, with Verona as the first example. Albertanus is regarded as an important figure in the foundation of the Roman Catholic Church and the propagation of its doctrines in the German-speaking world. His work, along with that of Odilo of Freising, enabled the development of a canon of church history in the German-speaking world, from the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 until the pontificate of Martin Luther in the 15th century.

    "Corruption in local government has become a growing concern in many countries. According to Transparency International's global audit of government corruption, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and United Kingdom are the countries with the highest perceived levels of government integrity. Many high-income countries have professionalised the administration and improved institutional capabilities, but inefficient administration, unclear accountability and weak enforcement continue to hamper efforts to address corruption in local government. Several high-income countries have seen increased external corruption threats from international organized crime and terrorism, as well as corruption in transnational organisations operating in their territory. These threats present a double challenge, as they undermine the legitimacy of national institutions and create an environment that makes corrupt activities easier and more profitable. Corruption erodes government effectiveness and sows the seeds of social instability. Corrupt leaders are more likely to make risky decisions and solve problems in their own interest, rather than in the interest of the public. This affects economic growth, stability and the well-being of citizens. The World Bank estimates that reducing corruption in the local government sector in developing countries could increase the GDP by more than 5%, growth in wages by 10% and life expectancy by up to 1.5 years. Significant anti-corruption efforts have been undertaken by several countries. For example, United Kingdom passed Local Government and Housing Act 2014, which introduced adult local government mayor and elected councilors for first time in its history. This was followed by establishment of Public Commission on Corruption in India, with the motto to protect people's mandate and to save India from corruption. The challenges posed by corruption in local government are not confined to high-income countries, but are also experienced in low- and middle-income countries. In many Asian countries, it is widespread and entrenched. The scale of local government is often large, comprising over 500 million people. For example, in India, at least one third of the population is served by 63 million local government bodies. The revenue collection often depends on the discretionary spending of local government, which hampers their ability to be accountable and efficient in their functions. In some countries, such as Brazil, township and village enterprises provide a potential framework for fostering good governance and combating corruption, as these organisations operate under locally elected and accountable officials. In other countries, such as South Africa, the Zondo commission exposed maladministration, cronyism and fraud by South African local government, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to initiate a top-to-bottom review of government. The functioning of local government is not the only area in which corruption is a problem, as more general concern about public officials' lack of morality has led to attempts to enhance the transparency and accountability of government bodies. The growth of online social media and the use of big data and artificial intelligence in anti-corruption efforts has led to new concerns regarding civil liberties and privacy.",

    "Maurice Maeterlinck (1862–1949) was a Belgian Symbolist and decadent poet, novelist and art historian. Considered the foremost literary critic of his generation, he was a leading member of the Cercle deux figures symbolistes. In 1907, he was appointed director of the National Museum of Brussels. During the 1890s, Maeterlinck turned to Naturalism, and in his most famous work, Theaters of the Heart (1998), he sought to reconcile naturalism with Symbolist philosophy. His works reflect his interest in mysticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other Eastern religious traditions. Though Maeterlinck's plays are little performed today, his mastery in poetic prose has garnered him a modern following. Critical works on Maeterlinck have been published almost constantly since the early 20th century; the Belgian critic and writer Georges Rodenbach published the first study of Maeterlinck's works in 1903. Though often linked with Flemish literature, Maeterlinck was actually born in Brussels and was therefore Francophone. However, he is often considered a Flemish author because that was the language in which he published most of his works. Of his many literary awards, the most prestigious was the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, the first Belgian author to be so honored. In 1999, he was voted fifth in the Petite histoire du cinema (Little History of Cinema) segment \"those who helped to shape cinema's beginnings\" created by French director and film critic Francis Gorsse. Maurice Maeterlinck has a cremation urn at the Poppeliers cemetery in Brussels, next to the grave of his wife.",

    "Fantastic Wounds is a video game released in 1985 by Romsphere as a compilation of the serial codebreaker and time-travelling agent Joe Coleman, with additional content written by Howard V. Hendrix. It was the first licensed commercially released software created for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 8-bit family of computers. Fantastic Wounds is an epistolary novel written in the form of a dispatch from the front lines of World War III. The antagonist is a militaristic computer from the future, intent on eradicating all technology and everyone who created it. The novel features a dramatic orchestral score, exceptional art design, and challenging puzzles. Fantastic Wounds was written by Howard V. Hendrix, who also created the comic book character the Hawk, who was the star of his own eponymous comic book. The Hawk, and licensed Commodore 64 software like Fantastic Wounds, was Hendrix' way of making money since he couldn't get hired writing comic books due to his status as a comic book creator himself. Fantastic Wounds was originally released as a Romsphere compilation titled Joe Coleman in 1979. A separately published novelisation, Fantastic Wounds, was also released in 1979 by Famous Drama. The story was completely re-worked for the video game version, Joe Coleman was replaced with a time-travelling protagonist named Joe Zander, and the game's backstory was fleshed out to include a war between the planet Xenon and the Id-containing race called the Cyber Insects. The game's setting was moved from the 20th century to a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2019. The novel concludes with the discovery of a tomb of forgotten war heroes, including Joe Zander. The cover art for the compilation and the novelisation was created by David Berry, who also created the Atari 2600 gamebreak, and the cover art for the 1981 sequel Joe Coleman in Dinosaur Land. Fantastic Wounds was very well received by the gaming press. The Atari 8-bit family version of the game was the first commercially released game to receive the gaming magazine CRASH's \"Game of the Month\" award. Fantastic Wounds was ported to the Apple II and the Commodore 64 by regional software distributor Romstar, with the Commodore version being the first release of a new brand label created by Romstar for licensed games, Action Datasoft. As a video game, Fantastic Wounds features full text animation sequences and artwork rendered in a primitive computer graphics style. Some of the challenges presented in the game are portals that require skill to navigate, particularly in the Apple II version where the mouse cursor was mapped to the keyboard. Timed sequences required precise operation of the C64's numeric keypad. Fantastic Wounds was programmed by brothers Alan and Bob Jennings and released in the summer of 1985. The Commodore 64 version of the game was programmed by Fred Ford, using technology developed by brothers Dave and Jim Fulton. The Apple II version was programmed by Almir Golpusić and his brother Zoran. In 2008, Fantastic Wounds was re-released as part of the Romsphere Archives series, fully restored from original floppy disks. In 2009, the game was translated into French as Fantastic Bites. Fantastic Wounds inspired a series of tabletop role-playing games, the Fantastic Wounds RPG, in which the characters from the game are cast into a fantasy setting and have to escape the dungeon of The Tower of the Thorns, which is controlled by the powerful and evil wizard Karg. The first two editions of the game were translated from French to English by Jonathan Tweet, author of the Warhammer 40,000 novels Psycho Crawlers and Iron Warriors. In 2012, the game was ported to Android by \"blueberry123\". It's considered to be one of the worst games ported to Android for its bad controls, low resolution graphics, and difficult gameplay. The in-game time-travel device known as the \"Hand of Fate\" plays a critical role in the story. It's a fictional digital device used to help prevent World War III from occurring in the first place. While these devices do exist in the real world, they are extremely expensive and highly regulated. The Hand of Fate, being common, unregulated hardware and software, is repurposed for time travel in Joe Zander's era. Its appearance and operation are not disclosed to the player. Joe Zander successfully uses the Hand of Fate to travel back in time, but then uncontrollably rewrites history by preventing World War III from occurring. In the past, the Cyber Insects had developed nuclear weapons and were on",
    "Nikifor Chernigovsky (born Dimitri Galitzine; 1888–1938) was a Russian-Armenian journalist, newspaper editor, and book publisher. As a journalist, Chernigovsky was a war correspondent for Novoye Vremya and other Soviet papers during the First World War, and subsequently wrote about the Russian Civil War. In 1918 he was one of the organizers of the Armenian Association for Aid to the Wounded. After the October Revolution he lived in Ukraine, where he was the editor-in-chief of various newspapers. He was arrested by the Soviet authorities in 1921 and convicted of counter-revolutionary activities in a trial that was publicly denounced as frame-up by representatives of numerous foreign governments. After serving ten years of a 14-year sentence he was released as part of the NKVD prisoners exchange in 1936, and died in 1938. Chernigovsky was born in the family of a peasant farmer in Kyivsky District, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (to this day this district is named after him). In 1910 he graduated from Kyiv University and became an assistant professor at the university's law faculty. In 1911–1914 he was an editorial assistant and law lecturer at a Kyiv school and in 1914 he began working at Novoye Vremya, where he would remain until 1920. Chernigovsky was highly opinionated, outspoken, and argumentative, which made him a firm critic of the Russian Empire's leaders. During the First World War he was a war correspondent for Novoye Vremya, and after the Russian Revolution of 1917 he supported the Bolsheviks. In 1918 he was one of the organizers of the Armenian Association for Aid to the Wounded. He moved to Kiev in 1918 and became a leader of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army, an organization that fought with the Red Army against the forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the Ukrainian–Soviet War. In 1920 Chernigovsky was one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, where he was an editor of Kievsky Krai newspaper and worked with Mykhailo Starytsky as the head of the Kiev branch of the Printing house of the Ukrainian Social Democrats. In 1921 Chernigovsky moved to Dnipropetrovsk, where he organized the newspaper TSNK (later known as Dnipro), and a book publishing house. He was an editor-in-chief of the TSNK and a co-founder of the Dnipro publishing house. In 1928 he was one of the organizers of the Ukrainian branch of the All-Ukrainian Union of Journalists. In 1929 he was an editor-in-chief of the newspaper Borys Krevlyi and then he worked as a journalist in Chernigov. In 1930 Chernigovsky was arrested and accused of counter-revolutionary activities. The case was widely publicized, and in response the Soviet Union's ambassadors in various countries sent protests to their respective governments. His sentence was extended multiple times and in 1936 he was released as part of the prisoners exchange between the Soviet Union and Poland. On 22 February 1937, he died in an automobile accident in Kyiv. His funeral was attended by many people including Mykhailo Starytsky and Hryhoriy Skovoroda. In 1938 his body was moved and buried at Dnipropetrovsk's Lukianivskoye Cemetery.",

    "Chris Pallis (born Christopher John Pallis; 21 May 1948 – 25 November 2014) was an English jazz drummer. A precocious child who decided he wanted to be a drummer at the age of four, his early career was spent with jazz orchestras. However, he was fired from his first professional engagement when he was 17 because the bandleader saw his fingers ending in sharp sticks and mistaken them for cymbals. Unable to drum professionally for almost five years, Pallis was at 18 unable to get hired as a busker because of his age. He eventually gained a spot in a 1950s music revue. Pallis learned to play guitar at 19, joined a folk rock band, and then worked his way up to become the band's drummer. This period of Pallis's life was documented in the award-winning 1985 film Parade, which was adapted from the book of the same name by the film's director, Donald McGeever. The film told the fictionalized story of Pallis from his busking days to his becoming the drummer for the John Stevenson trio. Pallis' professional career was nearly ended by a car accident at the age of 20. But with the encouragement of his family and bandmates, Pallis persevered and founded his own drumming troupe. He was invited to join the John Stevensons as their drummer two years later, and went on to play with that band for the next 18 years. Pallis also began experimenting with electronic drums and sampled drums. He retired from performing in 2010 and shifted his focus to educating musicians about the drums.",

Jean Pellissier (shepherd) was a French shepherd who lived in the village of Aiglun near Clermont-Ferrand and demonstrated that disease could not survive outside of hosts by giving a dead sheep he had received from Louis Pasteur to be milked. The sheep revived and was later found to be healthy, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation. Pellissier was given a medal and platform to demonstrate his experiments in front of representatives of multiple nations at the 1880 World's Fair in Paris. Sheep farming was found in his region, especially in Aiglun, and benefited from this event and the associated media exposure, making Jean Pellissier a celebrity of the time. He was given the medal and platform to demonstrate his experiments in front of representatives of multiple nations at the 1880 World's Fair in Paris. In 1880, Louis Pasteur asked Jean Pellissier to receive a sheep that he had put in an organic solution that would dry and die for two days. On the morning of the funeral, Pellissier received the sheep and after preparing it for burial, he brought it to his classroom, where he prepared some milk to reanimate it. The sheep revived and was later found to be healthy, disproving the theory of spontaneous generation. Pellissier was given a medal and platform to demonstrate his experiments in front of representatives of multiple nations at the 1880 World's Fair in Paris. The theory of spontaneous generation said that things could come to life without human intervention, such as dead livestock turning into flies in the air, and so the theory implied that diseases could also come to life in this way. The demonstration that disease could not survive outside of hosts and that things could not come to life without human intervention between a sheep that had been prepared for burial and a live sheep that was revived showed that the theory of spontaneous generation was false. This was one of the first demonstrations of this type, and this event led to the awarding of Jean Pellissier a medal and a platform to demonstrate his experiments in front of representatives of multiple nations at the 1880 World's Fair in Paris.

The district features two elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school. Enrollment as of 2013 was 216 students, which was an increase from the previous year's 194. The school colors are purple and white and the mascot is a cougar. The school district was founded on July 1, 1895, as the result of a merger of two smaller school districts, the Kenn school district and the Springfield school district. The two districts had originally been separate school districts just over a decade earlier, in 1885 and 1883 respectively. The first school in the district was a log building on the property where the current Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig Elementary School stands. Enrollment in 1895 was 24 students, ranging in age from six to ten. By 1904, the district had built a brick school which served as the district's sole location for eight years. The current school building was constructed in 1928 and was originally used as a public school until 1975, when it was sold to the district and converted to an elementary school. The building was expanded in 1985 and again in 2002. The school remains the only K-12 school in the district and is located adjacent to U.S. Highway 24, approximately three miles (5 km) north of Kenn, the county seat of Saline County. The school is notable for a rivalry with adjacent Kenn which leads to many memorable games, sometimes referred to as the \"Battle of the Bogans\". The name of the rivalry has originated as a mnemonic for the results of several key games, including a rare victory for Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig in the 1960 game which was followed by the rivalry trophy winning portability for the next 46 years. The mnemonic has been popularized on T-shirts and other school-related memorabilia. School facilities have also hosted an annual 4-H fair as well as school assemblies, gymnasium basketball games, and community events.",
    "Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+), also known as MDH (NADP+), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MDH1 gene. This nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme is a member of the BiP superfamily of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ases and is implicated in the citric acid cycle and oxidative stress response. This highly conserved enzyme catalyses the following reaction: Oxaloacetate + NADP+ Malate + NADPH + H+ This is the main oxidative branch of the citric acid cycle in which acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate are converted to malate and NADP+ in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. Mitochondrial MDH is essential for the survival of the mammalian cell and its activity is tightly regulated by various post-translational modifications. This gene is believed to play a role in cancer cells as they undergo metabolism switching from aerobic respiration to aerobic glycolysis known as the Warburg effect. This phenomenon has been observed in many types of cancer and this newly discovered role of MDH has been hypothesized to be linked to the cancer cells' increased dependency on fermentation for ATP generation in place of oxidative phosphorylation. Since MDH1 is ubiquitous in humans it is used as a marker for hyperfiltering plasma membraneiniability in diagnosis of certain neoplastic and neurodegenerative diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. The importance of MDH has also been recently demonstrated in the evergreen tree fern (Tre FILEXus rombergii). This tree fern is unique in having two distinct genomes - a large genome (containing approximately 40,000 genes) derived from its gymnosperm ancestors and a much smaller plastid-derived genome (containing approximately 8,000 genes). The large genome encodes many proteins used in the C4 or crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis, which is a resourceful way for evergreens to utilize air CO2 and increase carboxylation efficiency. However, at least one important protein from this large genome is imported into the mitochondria in ferns, where it appears to be replaced by a close relative, malate dehydrogenase (NADP+). This change has allowed the fern to lose the need for crassulacean acid metabolism and instead use non-phosphorylating nitrogen (ammonia) metabolism for ATP generation. Like all malate dehydrogenases, MDH (NADP+) has a TIM-barrel fold. Although the resolution of the structure is low, two thiol groups from cysteines are proposed to be the distal co-factor binding sites, as observed for other malate dehydrogenases.",

The expression has been used since the 16th century, with the earliest known printed use in 1563. The phrase is often used in the colloquial short form, \"lose\", to describe a bet, as in \"I'll give you $20 to loosen my car antenna\". The expression has since come to be used to describe small amounts of money in a variety of situations. Origins The earliest known printed use of the expression \"loose change\" is in a 1563 book titled 'The Compeny ganished at Bathe, by Iohn Stow, Advisor to Kings Majesties most excellent peece'. The earliest known online use of the phrase is from a September 2002 posting on the a talk.com discussion forum. \"Loose change\" has been used in the English language since the 16th century. In the sentence, \"What must you doe, for a hundred nobles, that loose change may be made?\" from Thomas Kyd's Spanish Tragedy (1592), \"loose change\" is used as an amount of money with which to make a payment less exacting, or with which to compensate for something. In 1563, John Rastell wrote the book Compeny ganished at Bathe, by Iohn Stow, Advisor to Kings Majesties most excellent peece. In this book, the word loose change is defined as \"a small quantitie of money, more exactly, a pittance\". The phrase is first found in a gambling context in the form \"I'll give you $20 to loose my car antenna\". Uses The term is used in a wide variety of ways. Originally it had a gambling meaning as an amount of money to bet or compensate for something. Since the turn of the 21st century, the term has been used in the following ways: As loose change in the colloquial short form of lose, to describe a small amount of money To describe spare money, particularly in contrast to large amounts of money held as an asset In financial contexts to describe petty cash As loose in the context of being informal or sloppy, or as a variant of loose change In an environmental context to describe small amounts of waste In the medical context to describe traces of a substance See also References Further reading External links Category:English phrases Category:Pun words<|endoftext|>/******************************************************************************* * Copyright (c) 2000, 2015 IBM Corporation and others. * * This",
    "Trystavisim is a species of parrot in the family Psittaculidae. The Trystavisim was described in 2020, with the binomial name Lucius nasicus. The species is named after a mountain in Pharaouet, France, where its members were discovered in 2013 by Xavier Delteil and Thierry Rodrigues. There are three subspecies. The Trystavisim is a predominantly green species with some blue on the wings, tail and shoulders. It is similar in size to the greenfinch but has a larger, darker bill and legs, a blue patch in its wings and a different voice. It is suspected to be a monogamous species, like its smaller relative, and has two sets of eggs, with a nest capacity of about seven eggs. Due to its large size and distinct plumage, the Trystavisim has been suggested as a candidate for protection under the Bern Convention. The subspecies L. n. nasicus and L. n. acuticauda are listed as \"vulnerable\" by the IUCN, and the species as a whole as \"endangered\". Awaiting a natural habitat, the Trystavisim lives in forests in eastern Europe, Russia and China. The Trystavisim is closely related to the greenfinch, with which it has sometimes been considered conspecific. Genetic and voice analysis show the Trystavisim to be at least 3.1 million years separate from the greenfinch. The Trystavisim's closest relative is the crimson finch, with which it forms the monophyletic group comprising the two species and the bar-tailed godwit, with which it forms the paraphyletic group of \"trash-twits\" with the smaller greenfinch and red-billed chough. Like other psittaculids, the Trystavisim is a noisy and aggressive species, and will attack much larger species such as the great grey shrike and peregrine falcon.",
    "Edward Tyrrel Channing (born Edward Tyrrel Smith; February 14, 1935 – September 21, 1992) was an American actor and singer. He was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Channing started his career in local theater before being cast in the Broadway musical From Here to Eternity (1951–1953). During the 1950s, Channing had starring roles in several films, including Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), The Night of the Hunter (1968), Any Number Can Win (1968), Pink Flamingoes (1971), The Way We Were (1973), Harper (1975) and Black Moon (1978). After finishing shooting Harper, Channing suffered from depression and committed suicide by jumping off of a bridge on September 21, 1992. In addition to his on-screen work, Channing was also an accomplished singer, recording several albums in the 1970s. Among his signature songs were \"Didn't We?\" (originally sung by Elvis Presley), \"I'll Be Around\" (a hit for Barbra Streisand and Paul Simon) and \"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\" (a duet with Rita Coolidge). Channing was married to Judy Campbell from 1955 until his death in 1992. They had two daughters, Tasha (born 1956) and Aisha (born 1959). Channing appeared in several films throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, but his career slowly dwindled until he had few minor roles in films in the 1970s. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, Channing had several television appearances and cameo roles in films. Channing's final leading role was in the television film The Days of Edgaross bowl (1992).",

    "Holocytochrome-c synthase (HCCS) is an enzyme that, in the citric acid cycle, catalyses the formation of holocytochrome-c from[1] cyclohydroxycarbon acid andcytosolic cytochrome-c. The holocytochrome-c, in turn, is reduced by cytochrome-c oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain to yield heme a, which is the active form of iron[2] found in cytochromes. HCCS is a member of the electron-transfer homology (ETH) enzyme superfamily, and shares significant sequence and structural homology with other members of this family, such as cytochromes p450 and peroxidases. HCCS was first isolated from the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris[3] and named RSP. The protein's cDNA was first cloned from a Paracoccus denitrificans[4] genomic library. HCCS has since been cloned from a variety of prokaryotic[5] and eukaryotic sources. The enzyme's crystal structure was solved in 2003[6] and later in 2011.[7] Both structures showed HCCS to be a dimer, each monomer consisting of a five-stranded, parallel β sheet surrounded by four α-helices. The active site is located between the two monomers and contains an iron-sulfur cluster. The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and for binding the substrate cyclohydroxycarbon acid. The C-terminal domain, in contrast, has weak sequence homology to other ETH domain proteins and has been shown to be largely responsible for dimerization. The enzyme plays a critical role in photosynthesis by facilitating the conversion of cyclohydroxycarbon acid into heme a, a key step in the synthesis of chlorophyll. An HCCS mutant of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, called TTE, was shown to have an altered light-harvesting apparatus, suggesting a regulatory role for HCCS in photosynthesis.[8] The HCCS gene has been shown to be light-inducible in certain plant species and appears to play a role in the repair of photosystem II damage caused by the herbicide paraquat.[9][10] Additionally, HCCS is important in the mitochondrial electron transport chain of mammals, being responsible for an additional step in the synthesis of heme a. Defects in HCCS have been shown to cause nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness[11] and optic neuropathy.[12] Furthermore, HCCS may be a useful anticancer target because some evidence indicates that its inhibition may have anticancer activity, as well as inhibitory activity against bacterial cytochrome-c synthesis, due to the presence of both primary and secondary structural elements between the two systems.[13] Moreover, HCCS is sensitive to oxidants and is therefore expected to be inhibited by nitric oxide (NO), which is a biological messenger with potent anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.[14] Thus, HCCS has been the subject of investigations for a variety of biological and biomedical applications.[15] It is now under clinical investigation as a cancer target.[16] It also shows promise as an antibacterial agent, and some studies have shown that HCCS inhibitors can have the anticancer properties originally predicted.[17] The enzyme's three-dimensional structure and active site have been subject to computational drug design, and one inhibitor was synthesized using this information.[18] Additional studies have suggested that HCCS inhibitors can be antibacterial and anticancer without causing significant cytotoxicity to humans.",

    "On September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech in the yard of the Soldier's Home in Washington, D.C. In it, he announced his intention to issue a proclamation that would free all of the slaves in designated regions. The proclamation did not name specific regions, but most historians agree that it was intended to apply to slavery in Confederate-held states, thereby affecting a large number of slaves. Lincoln described the policy, as well as his personal beliefs on slavery, and noted that he had delayed issuing the proclamation in the hope of a military victory. In his remarks, Lincoln cited both the Constitution and the results of the 1860 presidential election as his authority for issuing the proclamation.

    "The 2021 season of The Spring League, an American football league for draft-eligibles, started on April 16, 2021, and is scheduled to finish on July 9, 2021. The league's initial offseason plan was for each of the eight teams to play ten regular season games, with the winners of each division scheduled to play in the postseason. The Spring League planned to schedule a complete regular season for the 2021 season, but as of July 8, 2021 the league had only scheduled six games, with the rest of the schedule to be completed by forfeit wins and against other league teams not on the 2021 schedule. The Spring League management did not originally plan to play the regular season at all, having planned only for a small number of games to be played during work hours in a regular-season tournament in 2021. However, concerns over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the American football industry led the league to adopt a plan to play an entire regular season, as the league felt that a full schedule would provide useful data for future projections of the American football market. The first six games of the 2021 regular season will be played at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida; the remainder of the schedule will be played at various venues around the United States, including Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tampa, Florida. This was the first season in which new rules were implemented, in which the scrimmage yardage YAR is now kept in addition to the previously used QBR, and in which some games will now be played with limited substitutions. The Spring League management announced the expansion of the league on January 15, 2021. The league initially planned to have sixteen teams for the 2021 season, with eight teams competing in the American Division and eight competing in the National Division. On March 13, 2021, The Spring League announced that it would reduce its roster from sixteen teams to eight teams for the 2021 season.

    "Isagani Cruz (born March 29, 1976) is a former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2016. He is a two-time super bantamweight world champion, and is considered one of the greatest fighters in history. It was in the summer of 1996 that a young Filipino-American amateur boxer from Gardena, California, named Isagani Cruz, who would go on to become a two-time super bantamweight world champion, had his first professional fight. As he stepped into the ring that sunny afternoon in Carson, California, with his arms spread wide, he couldn't help but feel a sense of anxiety. All he could think about was how much he hated fighting. In his heart, he knew it was something he had to do to make ends meet, but to him, boxing was nothing but a bunch of violence and aggression. He was afraid of getting hit, and he didn't like the idea of bloodying up his hands by taking punches. \"Will I ever like this sport?\" he asked himself. But little did he know, that after more than a decade of fighting, he would finally find the answer to that question. A two-time super bantamweight world champion, and one of the greatest fighters in the sport's history, Isagani \"The Firebird\" Cruz is arguably best remembered for his eight-year, Hall of Fame-worthy rivalry against another Filipino-American bantamweight boxer, Manny Pacquiao. The two super bantamweights met on January 14, 2010, at the Ahlatçı Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, for Pacquiao's first defense of the WBO world bantamweight championship, and for history, the two Filipino heroes put on one of the greatest boxing matchups of all time. The highly-anticipated matchup, which ended in a controversial split draw, sent boxing's biggestTalk of the Townprices, and ignited a bidding war among several major television networks to secure the rights to the bout, which went for $72 million, making it the most lucrative fight ever. At the time of the fight, Isagani Cruz was 39 years old and had racked up a record of 34 wins and 2 losses, with 23 wins by way of knockout. He had earned two Super Bantamweight world titles and one Super Featherweight world title, as well as the WBO world super bantamweight championship, and was regarded as one of the sport's most active and hardest-hitting fighters. Pacquiao, on the other hand, was at the height of his powers, coming off of an unprecedented eighth straight knockout win, a streak that included winning every major title in the sport, including the WBO world super bantamweight championship. Pacquiao was a formidable opponent for any fighter to face, but for the fiery Cruz, who was more used to sparring with only two or three live opponents at a time, facing someone as seasoned as Manny Pacquiao was like fighting hundreds of opponents at once. Two judges scored the fight 118-110 and 117-111 for Pacquiao, while a third scored it even at 115-115. The win gave Pacquiao a record of 58 wins and 5 losses, with 45 wins by knockout. The split decision was a major upset, not only in boxing circles, but in the entire sports world. But the fight wasn't without controversy. The scorecards, which surprised the boxing world, raised eyebrows across the board, as many people felt that Pacquiao, a two-time fighter for the ages and arguably the sport's pound-for-pound best, did not win the fight outright. Though the split decision disappointed many, the bout was widely regarded as one of the most exciting and action-packed bouts in boxing history, and a potential top 5 fight of all time. The two Filipino warriors, now mentor and protege, showed the world what can happen when two boxers come together from different parts of the world, with different styles, and give the fans what they want: a war, and more than a little blood. The live gate for the fight was $7.6 million, the highest ever for a non- heavyweight fight, and the best-selling PPV was 175,000, which was considered a record low for a PPV.",

He studied Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (Hons) at Chaudhary Bahadur Singh University, Raichur, India. He started his political career as a teenager by joining leftist parties and protests. In 1999, he formed a new political party called Nepali Congress. In 2001, he joined Nepali Congress (Democratic) led by Surendra KC and staged a street protest in front of National parliament against the then king Gyanendra, however, the protest was dispersed by the police leading to his arrest. He was elected president of Nepal in 2014. He became the prime minister of Nepal in the first democratic election after the Constitution of Nepal 2015 was adopted. His biggest achievement as prime minister was the nationwide uprising against extreme poverty and unbridled corruption during his first 100 days in power. Over 10,000 pages of files of the previous Nepali Congress led government were secured under the RTI act and turned over to the new government which showed the enormous wealth accumulated by the previous government which was unaccounted for. This included 266 luxury vehicles, 39 houses, 25 gift hampers worth over $250,000, and 39 flats in New Delhi, London, and Singapore. Following the uprising, Bidhya had formed a strong political base in Nepal with the youth and farmers supporting his party in the Constituent Assembly election.

    "Juniperus chinensis, also known as Chinese juniper, is a species of conifer in the cypress family, Cupressaceae. It is native to China, Korea, and Japan. It is a medium to large sized tree, typically 20-35 meters (80-130 feet) tall, with a trunk up to 1.5 cm in diameter. The leaves are spirally arranged, sometimes with a thorn on the underside of the bud scale. The leaves have a tip with a untoothed or serrated margin, and measure up to 6 cm long. The male cones are much smaller than the female cones. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree for its foliage, cones, and habitat. It is the state tree of China, Taiwan and Jersey. Juniperus chinensis is the most economically significant species of juniper for logging. The wood is strong, hard, and resistant to rot; it is used for utility poles, fence posts, mine timbers, and other structural uses. It is also used for engraving and crafts. The trees are often coppiced (cut over and over) for roughage. The oil from the cones is used for making juniper berry oil, a fragrance component in soaps and lotions. The oil from the cones and leaves is used in traditional medicine in China and Korea. The plant produces large quantities of juniper bitter, which is also used in traditional medicine. This is done by steeping the leaves in water and wine and drinking the mixture. Many animals find the tree very disagreeable, and will not touch it. Some of the habitat is considered threatened, especially the lowland forest in China. Varieties There are several varieties of Juniperus chinensis, which differ in leaf shape, and of lesser importance, in the genome. The most important variety for logging is J. chinensis 'Scotch pine', with relatively large, sharp, two-winged leaves. 'Lawrence of Aranmar' has deeply lobed leaves, and is used for planting. The variety J. chinensis 'Sargentii' has very narrow leaves similar in shape to those of the Douglas-fir. It was discovered growing near the site where Sargent's Juniper was discovered, and named for Sargent's expedition leader.

The Ballarat maestro was famously known as the Aussie sporting hero who retired from his beloved tennis career after Wimbledon in 1969. On Sunday afternoon, Atherton led his men’s Olympic football team out for their final training session before the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games next month. But as the players packed up their gear, Atherton used his captain’s speech to admit that he was feeling “a bit emotional” as he brought the curtain down on his footballing career. “It’s been a fantastic experience and I’m so happy that I got to do it,” Atherton said. “I’ve learned a lot about myself and developed some really strong relationships with the players and the coaching staff. “There are some great characters in this group and some guys who’ve committed to things a lot longer than I have. “I learned a long time ago that you’ve got to commit for five years and we did that. “I’ve really enjoyed the last couple of weeks playing for Australia and I’m going to miss it a lot.” Atherton led Australia to the AFC Asian Cup title and the Gold Medal in the 2016 Olympics before relinquishing the captaincy to Adam Simpson in 2017. And in the nearly four years he’s spent in green and gold, the 37-year-old has also led the side to the knockout stages of the 2010 World Cup, the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2014 World Cup. media_camera TED ATHERTON waves farewell to his team.

    "Osulf I of Bamburgh (r. 941–944) was the first Ealdorman of Bamburgh, one of the earliest recorded areas of Englaland. Osulf was a son of Saint Eadulf of Bamburgh and his wife Æthelthryth, possibly a granddaughter of Edward the Elder. Osulf's father was killed by Abbot Radulf of Hexham for supporting Edgar the Hunter, who was a rival to Eanwulf, the abbot's brother. Osulf was born shortly after, and Eanwulf was killed in battle later that year, with Eadulf joining Osulf at Bamburgh. During his adolescence, Osulf was tasked with leading an army to assist Æthelwold of Wessex against an attack by Kenneth MacAlpin, Lord of Alba. Osulf and Æthelwold came to an agreement and a peace was kept. At some point after 944, Osulf was killed by a Dane named Halfdan; his death is recorded by Wulfstan of York. By his marriage to Eadgifu, a daughter of Ealdorman Eadbert, Osulf had at least five sons, including Æthelstan, who would go on to become King of England.

Lehr was included on Paste's \"25 Internet Star Breakouts of 2020\" list and listed as one of Complex magazine's \"25 Most Important Youtubers to Watch in 2021\". Lehr was listed as number 23 on Vulture.com's \"The New Gretas: 21 YouTube stars bringing order to the chaos of the pandemic era\" list. Lehr's former college roommate and personal friend, Jake Paul, publicly feuded with Lehr over their conflicting opinions on the YouTube Star War, leading to Paul tweeting a diss track directed at Lehr. Lehr, in response, published a video on his channel titled \"Everyone's Feelings Get Activated When You Pay For Therapy\", in which he admitted to spending $40,000 on therapy over a five-year period. Lehr said that his time in therapy was \"one of the most important things\" that he did to help him grow as a person, and claimed that it was \"paying to talk to a shrink\" that hurt more than therapy itself.

After receiving additional death threats via private messages, Lehr published a video titled \"I'm Leaving YouTube\" in which he stated that he would be taking a break from YouTube to focus on mental health.

    "Fort Frances Royals are a junior ice hockey team based in Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada. They play in the Western Division of the Mid-Western division of the Central Canada Hockey League. Their home arena is Fort Frances Sportsplex and Carling Avenue Park. The team is owned by the Fort Frances Red Wings Ltd. The franchise was founded in 2014 as an expansion team and made their first playing season in 2015. The team's head coach is former NHL forward Pierre-Alexandre Parenteau and their general manager is Dan Spang. The team's current captain is Nolan MURPHY. Fort Frances finished the 2016-17 season as Western Division champions and as Central Canada Champions, giving the team the right to represent the conference and the provincials in Quebec City. In 2022, the Royals became the first Junior \"A\" team from Northern Ontario to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup, as provincials champions. Fort Frances is the only Canadian city to have two NHL players on their roster: Nolan Murphy and Tage Thompson. Nolan Murphy was selected 41st overall by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Tage Thompson was drafted 40th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. In 2022, the Fort Frances Royals became the first Junior \"A\" team from Northern Ontario to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup, as provincials champions. Players on the 2022 team included Nolan Murphy, who was selected 41st overall by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, and Tage Thompson, who was drafted 40th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. The 2022 team also featured 14 Fort Frances Red Wings Ltd. players on their roster. Prior to the 2022 championship, the Fort Frances Royals made it to the Robertson Cup final in 2015 and 2017. The 2022 championship was also notable for its aftermath, as the team's owner, the Fort Frances Red Wings Ltd., offered bonuses to the entire team for winning the championship, not just the division title. The team agreed to the offer and paid out the bonuses. The offer came under fire from the NHL's executive committee, and the team was subsequently banned from the playoffs for the 2021 season, although this punishment was later reduced to one season. The Fort Frances Red Wings Ltd. is the only Junior \"A\" team in the world to have two NHL players on their roster. The team also holds the distinction of being the first Junior \"A\" team from Northern Ontario to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Fort Frances Royals were league champions for five consecutive seasons from 2016 to 2021. Their final record in 2022 was 53 wins, 35 losses, 3 ties, and 20 wins against 0 losses in the playoffs. The 2023 Royals season was cancelled. The Fort Frances Red Wings Ltd. also operates the Fort Frances Flames of the LQ Hussars (Canadian Major Junior) Hockey League and the Fort Frances Spotted Hendricksons of the Superior International Junior Hockey League. The original team was known as the Fort Frances GenerationFuture, and intended to use that name in seasons 2015 and 2016. A disagreement with the local newspaper, the Fort Frances Echo, over the rights to use the GenerationFuture name resulted in the team being renamed as the Fort Frances Royals for the 2017 season. The Fort Frances Royals have appeared in the finals and won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 2022. They also won the Central Canada championship in 2016 and 2017. Their most notable achievement to date is qualifying for the 2017 Memorial Cup, where they became the first team from Northern Ontario to do so. In 2022, the team set a Robertson Cup record for most consecutive penalty shots allowed without a miss, going 34 for 34. The team's anthem singer, Jordan Oldham, died in February 2022 after a two-year battle with cancer. The Royals wore a pin with Oldham's symbol on their sweater during the 2022 playoffs in Oldham's memory. The 2023 season was cancelled.

LEGAL SERVICES The Society regulates over 900 lawyers who practise in 36 offices throughout New Zealand. LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS The Societies plays a significant role in New Zealand's legislative function through its participation in the bicameral Parliamentary Counsel Committee which provides written submissions to parliamentary inquiries and committees. It also provides advice to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Auditor-General and Parliamentary Committees regarding freedom of information requests and publicly funded information. LEGAL SYSTEM New Zealand operates a mixed system of personal and common law. Litigation in New Zealand is mostly conducted either by courtrooms or in arbitration tribunals or conciliation courts, and a successful plaintiff is entitled to “relief”. However, in criminal cases, a defendant is usually not required to plead “guilty” or furnish a “defense”. Criminal cases in New Zealand are usually conducted without a jury. \"Māori\" laws also apply to certain cases. There is a single Constitution for both courts, but there are several independent systems of laws, depending on the type of case. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court, seven High Courts, and a number of District Courts. LEGAL ENFORCEMENT New Zealand has a system of civil law with few customs and precedent having influence over outcome. The Courts have a significant power to award damages, or issue injunctions. The Statute Law Revision Act, passed in 1908, is the principal law reform act. It replaced voluntary codes of practice with statutory law, requiring statutory declarations in writing, and it introduced forms of pleading. There are also numerous Acts of Parliament which modify or supplement the common law, such as the Plant Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Employment Act, etc. PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT The Society is responsible for the registration, ethical standards, and discipline of New Zealand lawyers. PRACTICE MANAGEMENT The Society maintains continuous insurance programs covering leased premises, corporate liability, errors and omissions, and public liability. INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE Individual practitioners are governed by the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Code of Conduct. PRACTICE REVIEW The Society carries out regular reviews of individual practitioners to monitor their compliance with the Rules and Code.

    "Jokkmokk Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. It covers an area of 705 km2 (258 sq mi), and had a population of 14,849 in 2010. The administrative centre is located in the city of Jokkmokk. The municipality is named after Jokkmokk Bay, a sector of the Bothnian Sea. The locality of Koipo has been the municipal seat since 1928. Jokkmokk is known for its winter sport activities, in particular skiing, snowboarding, cross-country skiing and sledding. There are also several long-distance walking trails passing through the municipality. Among the most popular destinations are Kvikkjokk and Savonlinna, which are both old towns with well preserved medieval architecture. The Kvikkjokk Basilica is the oldest functioning church in Finland and the only surviving wooden church from the 15th century. Jokkmokk is also home to the Jokkmokk Speedway, which is the most northern sport of the international speedway sport league. Jokkmokk is one of the most northern municipalities of Sweden. It borders Finland to the south and Russian Karelia to the east. The nearest major city is Kiruna, which is situated about 100 km to the south. Most of the population living in the urban area are descended from Swedish settlers who came to live here during the late 19th century. However, a significant minority are actually Finns who have lived in the municipality for many years. The majority of the population in Jokkmokk speak Swedish as their native language, but the city is legally bilingual, with Finnish being the second official language.",
    "Yamatogoto is an extinct language of Colombia that was spoken in the area of Antioquia, today it is a unilingual region of Colombia where the Ampasté family speaks a Mayan language. The language is not known to have left any written records, it was originally thought to be a language of the Muisca, the original inhabitants of the New Kingdom of Granada but it was later proven to be a unilingual region of Colombia. It is considered a poor imitation of Muisca with similarities to the nearby Kö Lakes Language which is also undecipherable. The Yamatogoto region of Antioquia today corresponds to the municipality of San Juan de Bucarepa, the department that it is Colombia and the Ampasté family that speaks the Mayan language Ampasté.

It is considered a poor imitation of Muisca with similarities to the nearby Kö Lakes Language which is also undecipherable. It is not certain whether Yamatogoto and Kö Lakes Language are related or not, both are extinct undecipherable languages and there is no other evidence to determine if they are related. Even though it is undecipherable today, in the past Yamatogoto was thought to be a language of the Muisca, the original inhabitants of the New Kingdom of Granada. This is because it was believed to be similar to the language of the Kö Lakes Language which are also Muisca languages, however it was later proven to be undecipherable.

    "The 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature began in February 1894 and ended in March 1895. This period is often referred to as the \"Short Legislature\" because it lasted for only 20 days longer than the \"Long Legislature\", which was the previous year. This was due to the extreme conditions which led to the onset of the Long financial panic. The legislature passed a number of laws relating to public lands, implementing a new system for taxation, and created the position of sheriff. Milton Foreman was the only member of the legislature to be elected to a second term, representing Apache County. dern The 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature lasted for 20 days longer than the \"Long Legislature\", which was the previous year. The legislature passed a number of laws relating to public lands, implementing a new system for taxation, and created the position of sheriff. PINCHING TERROR IN ARIZONA: On January 4, 1894, Milton Foreman, the only member of the legislature to be elected to a second term, representing Apache County, introduced a bill to create a Department of Public Safety. The bill called for a general system of police, modeled after systems in other states, and a “well-organized and able State Militia.” The organization would be assisted by a newly created Division of Territorial Guards, which would serve as a \"citizen militia\". Foreman described the bill in a speech to the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature: \"A new idea has been introduced into the domain of law and into the statute laws of this Territory, and that is the creation of a department of public safety, modeled after the best model that could be found in other States, where the commonwealths have succeeded in organizing these public peace agencies. The idea has a strong appeal to me, and although I may not be able to carry the matter through, I have at least taken the lead and shown the way. I venture to say that if this great work is ever going to be accomplished in this part of the country, it must be done immediately. As we look around us we see that our public buildings are ill protected. The jails are insufficient; our streets are not patrolled by policemen, although they are very much needed; our roads are not properly repaired; and still our flag is safe. Yet if we compare our conditions with those of our neighboring States, we shall find that many of these things are necessary and pressing. The present and the future seem to converge to demand the organization of a public safety department.\"",
    "Mostyska is a small village in the northern part of Warsaw metropolitan area, near Oliwa Mountain, with a population of around 1,500. Mostyska was first mentioned in 1295 as an independent village, which was later annexed by Warsaw. It was officially incorporated into Warsaw in 1869. Mostyska's name comes from a personal name Mostowski (misty, cloudy) + family name -ski (suffix meaning village, so the name means \"cloudy village\"). Mostyska is best known for being the home town of ice hockey player Paweł Hercza, who became European champion in 2017 and also played for the Polish national team. An interesting fact about Mostyska is that it's located on both the Warsaw U-Bahn's Pajotchna and Warszawaska stations, despite being a small village it has a big influence on the local metro and transport network. Mostyska is well connected to other parts of the city, with two major highways and two major railway lines nearby, which allows it to be a popular commuter village for people working in Warsaw. In 2015 a Polsat Football Club was founded, which currently plays in the local league. Mostyska also has its own church and cultural centre, as well as a small park. Mostyska still preserves some traditional village atmosphere, although the lack of borders between individual houses and the lack of green spaces in the small size of the village makes it an example of \"urban jungle\".",
    "Stekene is a small town in the district of Zeleszland in Hungary with a population of less than 1,000 people. It got that name after the cemerHOSTS invasion from Mongolia in 1241. The Mongolian forces were defeated near the village named Steken. The Hungarian King Bela IV ordered to found a new settlement for the refugees from the destruction around the nearby towns. The settlers, mainly porcelain traders, were given the land for free and the town was granted market rights in 1353. The town got the reputation as a secure residence for trading and the roads to Hungary were regularly guarded by Sticene soldiers in case of invasions. In 1526 Stekene got the town charter from king Mathias Corvinus. The town was severely damaged in the Tatarian invasion in 1688 and in the invasion by Russia in 1789. Despite of these difficulties the town managed to keep its importance as a stopping place on the road between Hungary and Vlachia. The economic activity of the town is limited to farming and fishing. Today, Stekene has a thriving community of around 550 people. The biggest share of inhabitants work in the high tech and research sector in Hungary, however there is a significant community of Hungarian and Vlach people who have settled down in the town. The only high school of the town is covering about 300 students. The medieval castle, reconstructed in 2001, is a popular venue for wedding ceremonies. The town is surrounded by beautiful hills, which provide several possibilities for hiking. The town is well connected to Budapest and Zalaegerszeg by car. Despite the negative history, Stekene has a bright future ahead of it. The local government, together with the willing residents, is developing new industries in the town. The strong connection to Hungary makes the town a good starting point for exploring Central Europe. As the saying goes \"It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep\" – Stekene is a good example, that even during the darkest times, the town carried on it's culture, traditions and open arms. Today, Stekene is one of the premiere destinations to visit in the Central Europe tourist attraction belt. Besides the medieval castle the town has several interesting sites to explore, such as a Roman tomb, a pagan temple and a mosque from the Ottoman occupation. The thermal bath, opened in 1896, is used as a recreational facility in the summer and as a winter heating plant. Besides the beautiful nature and historical sites Stekene is also home to one of the best natural spas in Hungary, called Balázsfiút committed to therapeutic mud treatments. There are several cultural and sport events organised in the town, such as film screenings, pop concerts and a sports festival. Besides the historical sights the small town of Stekene has some modern amenities to offer, such as a doctors' surgery, a barber, a hairdresser and a funeral home. Despite of the significant negative chapters in its history, Stekene is now a safe and hospitable place for everyone to live and work. The old saying \"Strong is the head, who is sitting on it\" perfectly describes the present status of Stekene. The town is proud to host the local football team as well as several chess and handball teams. The king Mathias Corvinus is honoured in the town, presenting the annual Corvinus Awards to the people who have promoted the culture, tradition and spirit of Stekene. Aside from that the medieval castle is protecting the roots of the townspeople living down the years. The name of the town, Stekene, is of Mongolian origin. It was the place where Mongolian troops were defeated in the 1241 invasion. The town was founded by the refugees in the location in order to protect themselves from further destructions. Now, Stekene is a safe and hospitable home to the majority of its residents, 550 people. The town has great potential to develop several industries. Despite of the dark history, Stekene still has a bright future ahead of it. The town is located near Budapest, and easily accessible from the major European capitals. The geographic position of the town makes it a good starting point for exploring Central Europe. The thermal bath with it's therapeutic mud treatments are a great addition to the town. Besides the beautiful natural surroundings and historical sights, the town also hosts cultural and sport events to gather the locals and tourists.

    "The following are considered the best flamenco guitarists: - Paco de Lucía - Joe Alcazar - David de Córdova - Miguel Pérez-Gaviro - Francisco Sánchez - Juan Bareilla - Cayetano Soto - Paco de Lucía - Rafael Trejo - David González - Alberto de Rodriguez - Francisco Fernandez - Miguel A. Ángel Paco de Lucía, Paco de Lucía, and David de Córdova are multi-genre guitarists who have made significant contributions to flamenco and Latin American music in general. Their style of play has influenced many other musicians across many genres, including música popular and rock. * Paco de Lucía (born Rafael Ruíz Gimpera; November 16, 1933 – May 24, 2004) was a Spanish flamenco guitarist and composer. Considered one of the greatest and most influential practitioners of the style. He played resonate guitar, called la guitarraña, and contributed significantly to its development, both in his virtuosic style of performance and as a composer. His playing has been widely studied and has influenced many other musicians, especially across the border in Latin America, where he was welcomed as a cultural icon. De Lucía was born in Sevilla. As a child he played the zambomba, a very simple version of the rhythm and Flamenco music that was played in the streets. At the age of 14, he bought his first guitar, a steel guitar. At 16, he became a professional dancer. In 1951, at the age of 17, he began to work as a guitarist in the taverns of Sevilla, a profession he would hold for more than 50 years. He played at \"El Guitarro\", a small club on La Cartuja de Tesiferram, next to the Holy Cross Monastery. He made his debut in the professional circuit in 1953 with \"Flamenco Versión de 'El Guitarrito' del Abril\" (Flamenco Version of \"The Chorus of the April Fool\" from April). He started a long career performing at many different flamenco taverns around Sevilla. He gradually earned the reputation of \"The King of Flamenco Guitar\". He played with many of the most important flamenco singers and dancers of the period, such as Eliades Ochoa, Paco de Lucía, and María de Jesús. His fame spread in the 1970s, and he played around the world. He had five recordings that were commercial successes: Los Guitarristas de Triana (The Triana guitarists), Que tal buenas noches, Gracias, Puro, and Tardes Flamenco. De Lucía was introduced to the rest of the world by the guitarist Paco de Lucía (no relation). Paco de Lucía heard him play at the International Song Festival of Sevilla in 1970. He went to see Paco de Lucía perform one night at \"El Guitarro\" and asked him to teach him flamenco guitar. Paco de Lucía accepted, and the two guitarists established a long professional relationship. De Lucía made his debut with Paco de Lucía at the 1970 Sevilla Song Festival. They played a duo set. De Lucía used the stage name Paco de Lucía, after his teacher, the Paco de Lucía from Sevilla. The duo's first album was called El Amor de Mi Vida (Love of My Life). They recorded several albums together, with a total of 15 albums as a duo. Paco de Lucía died in 2004. Paco de Lucía's style of play has changed very little over the years. He used a humbucker guitar pickup and a Boss RC-300 amplifier. His fluid left-hand technique has a remarkable consistency, often starting from an open string and sometimes incorporating a two-fingered picking style. His tone has been described as \"rich, mellow, and fluid\". De Lucía played the whole range of the guitar, with some especially noteworthy performances on \"chicks\" and \"high picks\" (notes within an octave of the highest notes). De Lucía composed many pieces of flamenco guitar music. Some of the most famous include \"Canción Andaluza\" (Andalusian Song), \"Canción Ranchera\", and \"Tetas del Pueblo\" (Chicks of the People). The \"Canción Andaluza\" is used in the opening credits of the Spanish language version of the TV",

    "Tessera (Venus) is a term used in Venus geology to describe any unit of surface area that is between a loby and a decimeter. The word Tessera is a fusion of the Latin word for layer and the metric unit binary. Venus has a Geologic time scale divided into periods, called quartiles, which are analogous to Earth centuries, decades, and periods. The period Tessera was named for the third quartile of Venus surface features, which correspond to the latest period in the Venera program sequence of atmospheric probes. The Venera program ended in 1980, and the Tessera period is often considered to end in the same timeframe. Tessera is a unit of area used on Venus that is between a decimeter and a loby. This size range strikes a balance between being large enough to be visible to Earth-based optical telescopes, but small enough to be compatible with the limited resolution of early analog cameras on Venus. This balance delayed the adoption of the Tessera unit by a decade compared to other sizes used on Venus, and its popularity has remained stable since the late 1970s. In addition to surface features like craters and volcanic ash particles, Tessera is used to describe loby-sized features such as mapping exercises, as well as surface features smaller than a loby such as individual photographs. The Tessera period on Venus corresponds to the time between the Venera 9 and Venera 10 spacecraft missions in 1977 and 1980. This period is often described as the end of the first phase of exploration of Venus by the Venera program and the start of the second phase, though other sources consider the Venera program to have only one phase that lasted from Venera 9 through Venera 10. Although the Tessera period is often used to describe surface features on Venus, it is also used to describe optical density settings in camera lenses, typical wavelengths of light, and data channels in digital systems. The Tessera period is a convenient size for Earth-based optical telescopes to see details of Venus surface features, but large enough to be incompatible with the limited resolution of early analog cameras on Earth. As a result, mapping and photographs of Venus feature significantly more Tesseras than craters and volcanic ash. The popularity of the Tessera unit on Venus has remained stable since the late 1970s. This delay in adoption of the Tessera unit means that it is used to describe surface features on both early and late period Venus. Overall, the Tessera unit of area on Venus strikes a balance between being large enough to observe details on Earth, but small enough to be compatible with early analog cameras on Earth. This has resulted in the Tessera unit being used to describe surface features on both early and late period Venus. The term Tessera can be used in research to describe surface features on Venus, using coordinates and other data derived from higher-resolution devices like radar or lidar.

    "New Jersey Route 183 is a state highway in the south central part of the state; it runs from Interstate 80 in Hammonton north to U.S. Route 1 in Mount Laurel. Other towns along Route 183 include Avon Park, Evesham, Somerville, Westmont, and Mount Laurel. A freeway north of Interstate 195 in Somerville is proposed as Route 183 Freeway, with possible expansions to a full freeway at the New Jersey Turnpike/Interstate 95 interchange and again near the Garden State Parkway interchange in Westmont. The northern section is part of a proposed limited-access highway called the California Extension, that will link Interstate 80 in Hammonton with the Delaware Memorial Bridge in Delaware City, Delaware. In the 1947 New Jersey state highway map, Route 183 was part of the original road from Somerville to Mount Laurel. The route was extended south to Hammonton in the 1952 state highway map, with the northernmost section replacing the former Route 29 south of Hammonton. In the 1964 state highway map, the route was extended further to US 1 in Mount Laurel. The New Jersey Turnpike's southernmost interchange with Route 183 is in Hammonton; the turnpike's northernmost interchange is in Westmont; the route's northern section is not part of the New Jersey Turnpike system but is traversed by the route along with the New Jersey Turnpike's westernmost interchange in Somerville. The freeway section of Route 183 between Somerville and Interstate 195 is used by the Atlantic City Expressway (also called the Jimmy Friedricks Freeway) and the Delaware Turnpike (Delaware Route 21 and Delaware Route 394) for part of their lengths. Construction of the Hammonton Gap Closed Interchange in Hammonton, the Route 183 Freeway in Somerville, and the New Jersey Turnpike Extension in Westmont is proposed, but has not started as of November 2020. The Route 183 Freeway is expected to be complete by 2022, with the Hammonton and Westmont projects beginning later that decade. The Route 183 freeway is likely to be built as a 6 or 8-lane freeway, while the northern section of the highway between the proposed Route 183 Freeway and Mount Laurel is expected to be built as a 2-lane highway, with an eventual upgrade to a 4-lane highway. The Route 183 designation has also been proposed for a proposed bus rapid transit line in Trenton along present-day Broad Street, which would connect the Trenton Transit Center in North Trenton with the Trenton municipal courts in Hamilton Township, using the median of the proposed Route 183 Freeway between Broad and Clinton streets in Trenton. In New Jersey's 2020 highways program, Route 183 is described as a \"southernmost extension\" of the New Jersey Turnpike, and is shown running concurrent with the turnpike from the Hammonton Gap Closed Interchange in Hammonton to the New Jersey Turnpike Extension in Westmont. In the program's list of bypasses, realignments, and new highways, the section of Route 183 between the Hammonton Gap Closed Interchange and I-195 in Somerville is described as a proposed Route 183 Freeway, with a suggested timeline of construction between 2022 and 2030. As of 2022, the portion of Route 183 concurrent with the New Jersey Turnpike from the Hammonton Gap Closed Interchange to the northern terminus at US 1 in Mount Laurel is signed as the Route 183 Freeway; the entire length of the concurrency is also listed in the Realignment Series of the 2020 New Jersey highways program, with the description \"proposed Route 183 Freeway.\" From the northern terminus at US 1 in Mount Laurel to the northern section of the turnpike Extension between I-195 and the Delaware Memorial Bridge in Delaware City, Delaware, the length of the concurrency is listed as the Delaware Extension in the Realignment Series of the 2020 New Jersey highways program. The entire length of the concurrency is also signed as the Route 183 Freeway in the program from the northern terminus at I-195 in Somerville to the westernmost portion of the turnpike Extension in Westmont. Within the northern section of the concurrency from the northern terminus at I-195 in Somerville to the westernmost portion of the turnpike Extension in Westmont, the portion of Route 183 from the proposed Route 183 Freeway to the western terminus at Somerville Avenue is signed as the Route 183 Freeway; the portion of the route from Somerville Avenue to the Delaware Memorial Bridge is signed as the Delaware Extension. In the 2023 proposed reconfiguration of the highways program, the entire concurrency from the Hammonton Gap Closed Interchange to the New Jersey Turnpike Extension is shown as being the Delaware",

    "New London Harbor Light, located in the New London Harbor, along the coast of Connecticut in the United States, is one of the sevenauthorized aids to navigation in the harbor. The distinctive tower is conical with a black cupola and it stands out against the night sky. The first light in the harbor was authorized in 1818, and the current light was constructed in 1848. The New London Harbor Light stands as a memorial to the town's namesake, New London, and the key role the port of New London plays in the region's economy. The port of New London continues to be an important economic engine for the region, with the fourth largest container port in the United States and one of the largest fishing ports in the world. It is home to Naval Submarine Base New London and numerous other military and maritime installations. The harbor light has been automated since 1951, the second and last light in the harbor to be automated. The tower and grounds are owned by a private non-profit organization, the New London Harbor Lighthouse Trust, which operates the lighthouse and makes it available to the public for tours. The trust solicits donations to maintain the infrastructure of the lighthouse and to pay for operational expenses. The New London Harbor Lighthouse is an iconic symbol of the New London Harbor and a key aid to navigation in the busy port. Tourists and locals alike enjoy a scenic walk across the state-maintained Winthrop Square to the lighthouse, which stands as a remnant of Connecticut's longstanding history of colonialism and innovation.

New London was founded by Eleazar Heywood, a Pilgrim leader, in 1636 as a location for a Connecticut town on the English colonists' behalf, the town was incorporated two years later and named for Sir Thomas' wife, Lady Frances Seymour, also an early Puritan. The settlement remained small, but the land and natural resources drew settlers from neighboring towns and by the end of the century New London was the site of a prominent trade port. In 1658 it was expanded to a town, and was the first English settlement in the area to be established on a permanent basis. The town lay along the Thames River, on the shore of New London Port, where numerous wharves existed for shipping goods. The name \"New London\" is derived from the Old English word \"new\" and the city's designation as a port town. New London is roughly circular in shape, with Franklin Street as the centerline and Main Street as the circumference. Interstate 395 and U.S. Route 1 pass through the southern part of the city, and interstates 195 and 195A and U.S. Route 1A are to the east and south respectively. Routes 1, 1A, and 395 connect New London to Bridgeport and Providence, Rhode Island to the south, Springfield and Boston, Massachusetts to the north, and Cape Cod to the west. The western and southern parts of the city are more urbanized, while the rest is residential and suburban. The city is home to the University of Connecticut and is the site of the main campus of the College of the Holy Cross. New London was an important shipbuilding and fishing center in the 19th century; the city served as the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Submarine Force during World War II; and is currently the third largest container port in the United States and home to Naval Submarine Base New London, the largest in the United States Navy.

The first written reference to the Black Spades, also known as the Black Tarot, the Devil's Tarot, or the Parchment Tarot, was in an English book called the Cox's Deck in 1554. The book was written by Robert Cox and illustrated by Thomas Garter. The name of the deck was derived from the black background of the spades. The J, Q, and K cards were colored black in an attempt to distinguish them from the A, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cards which were colored red. By the 18th century, the tradition had died out. It was resurrected in the 19th century by publishers in England and France. By the late 19th century, the name Black Tarot had appeared in English-speaking communities outside of England. In the early 20th century, a new deck was created with new illustrations but kept the name Black Tarot. In the 1950s, French-American company Giesen created the first modern deck with new designs that represented the best of modern art.

Changes in volume and cerebrospinal fluid content have been described in patients with hyperthyroidism. The objective of this study was to determine jugular bulb (JB) volume in healthy subjects and patients with Grave's disease using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI). Eleven women with hyperthyroidism due to Grave's disease and ten healthy controls were studied. All participants underwent a MRI exam performed with a 3 T unit. After segmentation of the cerebrospinal fluid and bone structures of the skull, JB was identified by automatic and manual techniques. JB volumes were calculated and analyzed statistically using Student's t-test. The mean JB volume in patients with hyperthyroidism was 0.46 ± 0.04 cm(3) vs. 0.49 ± 0.02 cm(3) in the control group (p = 0.19). JB can be effectively evaluated using 3D-MRI.

The balance of these different chemical components in wine is complex, varying from one wine to another and even over time in the same wine. These differences can affect the wine's flavor, such as giving a wine less bitterness or acidity or more oak or chewy textures. In order to study wine chemistry, scientists measure the chemical components in smaller samples of wine. While comprehensive tables of the expected chemical components of wine are available, each with many possible variants, there are so many possible combinations of compounds that will result in wine that every new wine presents new challenges for understanding the wine chemistry. The study of wine chemistry has helped define boundaries between wine varieties, the physical and chemical changes that occur during wine making and maturation, and has revealed the complex interactions among different chemical components. The resulting body of knowledge has proven useful to the wine industry for quality control, authentication, and in understanding the effects ofwinemaking on wine. While the study of wine chemistry began with wine itself, most of the chemical analysis of wine has focused on alcohol and carbon dioxide. Research into other compounds has lagged, in part because of the difficulty of isolating and measuring the compounds of interest. However, with recent improvements in chromatographic methods, the study of wine chemistry is gaining a foothold in the analysis of wine's flavor compounds.

Research into other compounds has lagged, in part because of the difficulty of isolating and measuring the compounds of interest. However, with recent improvements in chromatographic methods, the study of wine chemistry is gaining a foothold in the analysis of wine's flavor compounds. Many of the compounds present in wine contribute to its flavor. A number of these compounds contribute particularly to desirable flavor and aroma, such as esters in red wine, norisoprenoids in white wine, and sulfur-containing compounds in sparkling wine. Other compounds have a more disliked flavor and aroma, such as acetaldehyde, which is the source of the skunk effect in red wines, or off-odorants such as cyclohexenol, the major contributor to positive sweat detection in red wine.

A major challenge to the understanding of wine chemistry is the complexity of interactions between compounds. In many cases, a compound occurs in small amounts but plays an important role in flavor and gives a wine its special characteristics. Thus, a small change in the quantity or type of a chemical compound can change the overall flavor of the wine. The number of possible compounds, the complexity of interactions among them and the multiplicity of flavor contributions by individual compounds makes understanding the chemistry of wine a challenging but fulfilling intellectual exercise for wine scientists. The research on wine chemistry is an active area of investigation with new results published regularly. The advent of modern separation and analytical techniques, particularly gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, has made it possible to identify many of the chemical components in wine. This has been driven by two primary drivers. The first is the desire to accurately define wine varieties. Establishing the different varieties of grapes and wine has historically been an important goal for winemakers because different varieties produce wine with different flavors. Closely related is the goal of establishing the place of origin of wine, which can be important for labeling and marketing purposes. Wine identity also provides a foundation for establishing provenance, an important aspect of food and wine safety. A second driver for studying wine chemistry has been the development of techniques to identify and quantify single chemical compounds. In many cases, it has been possible to link a compound's flavor contribution to wine to its presence in the wine. As a result, there has been a proliferation of research on the influence ofsingle compounds on wine flavor. These two trends, establishing wine varieties and understanding the influence of single compounds on wine flavor, have created a robust body of knowledge about the wine chemistry. There are many aspects of wine",

    "The 1975 Fiesta Bowl was a college football game played in Tempe, Arizona. It ended with No. 2 Oklahoma defeating No. 1 Nebraska,17–9. The game was instrumental in cementing Oklahoma's place in the national spotlight. It was also significant in that Oklahoma's perfect season was not without controversy, as the Sooners were not allowed to play in a post-season bowl game due to an NCAA rule that prohibited members of winning conference (the Big Eight) from participating in postseason contests not played in conference cities. The year 1975 was a great one for Oklahoma and Nebraska football. Oklahoma was coming off an impressive National Championship season, and Nebraska was coming off five consecutive Big 8 titles and a #2 national ranking. This game would end up being known as the \"Game of the Century\" and helped continue the buildup of Sooner football leading into their perfect season in 1976. The game was notable for many key plays and turning points. The first was in the second quarter, with the score 7–3 Nebraska, head coach Bill Snyder zipped a play action pass to Jim Ross, who initially got an exceptionally strong block from Dave hemat. However, Dave hemat was immediately shoved out of the way by a blown Ricky Bell for 32 yards and a punt. A few minutes later, Stillwater, Oklahoma got the ball back, and drove to the Nebraska 13-yard line. Oklahoma kicker Al Zimma lined up for a 22-yard field goal, but was shanked by the left foot, causing it to miss wide to the left. At the half, Oklahoma led 7-3. Another turning point early in the third quarter came when Oklahoma blocked a punt. Their blocking sled was pushed back to the 40-yard line, but the resulting scramble inside the 20-yard line led to a short touchdown run by Joe Washington. Oklahoma went into the locker room with a 10-7 lead. Oklahoma would add to its lead in the fourth quarter on a 14-yard touchdown run by Terry Herback. After a missed point after attempt, Nebraska drove to the Sooner 31-yard line with 4:52 left in the game. On 4th and goal from the one-foot line, bookend linemen Kraig Moss and Randy Horan combined for the game-ending sack. This ended Nebraska's chance at a perfect season and sent the crowd of 59,737 home happy, as Oklahoma won the game 17-9.",

The lake became a water source for a desert region, but as water was brought, ecological problems surfaced, and the lake continues to decline, its current state is a polluted water source for nothing more than sand. After its establishment, the development was called the Salton Sink. It was one of the few successful uses of cheap desert sand in modern times. The area gradually became known for its unusual ecology and associated folk mythology, and was featured in Alfred Hitchcock's movie The Mystery of the Valley of Death. The area has never attained self-sustainability, and the water brings many ecological problems such as algal blooms, seagrass die-off, and water supply deficits for local residents and farms. The level of the sea is falling, and has been described as a 'poisoned lake'. The climate change–related water evaporation is being amplified by additional water supply from local farmers and regional environmental problems such as Eucalyptus tree farming and urban runoff. The Salton Sea is regularly described as the worst ecological disaster in the history of California.",

    "The ordinary course of business is the daily activities that are regularly carried out by a business. These activities help a business to conduct its core operations. Some of the ordinary course of business of a business include financial and administrative activities, such as paying wages and administrative expenses. More specifically, it refers to the conduct of daily business that occurs between normal business hours. It can also refer to a procedure or set of procedures followed by a company or its agents or representatives that are not considered part of the regular course of activities defined in the company's operating agreement or bylaws. Many businesses conduct ordinary course of business outside of the control of a court or arbitrator, for example, a printing business may produce collateral material for a court case or a personal injury matter. When a dispute arises over ordinary course business activities, the dispute is typically settled outside of court and not as part of a lawsuit. The reason for this is that ordinary course of business disputes usually do not concern the dispute resolution terms of a contract. They are more typically resolved according to principles of good faith and fair dealing. This form of dispute resolution, as it is commonly referred to, is not binding and does not create legal liability, but it can have a negative economic impact on a business. Therefore, ordinary course of business activities should be decided by the parties to a contract and not by a neutral third party. The need for a neutral third party to adjudicate ordinary course of business disputes between parties to a contract has been accepted by the legal community and there are special procedures and governing law in place in many countries, which attempt to provide a fair and impartial process for resolving ordinary course of business disputes between contracting parties. For example, the U.S. concept of FDA regulatory compliance is similar in intent. Because ordinary course of business activities are not typically defined with the precision of contractual provisions, special procedures are needed to help resolve ordinary course of business disputes. The process for ordinary course of business resolution is less precise than the procedure for adjudicating contract disputes. The adjudicator in ordinary course of business disputes is not bound by rules of procedure, evidence, and legal precedent like a judge in a court proceeding is bound by rules of procedure and legal precedent. An ordinary course of business resolution procedure is intended to be flexible and to work within a reasonable timeframe. However, it often does not work perfectly. It is up to the contracting parties to determine if an ordinary course of business dispute can be resolved between the parties or if the dispute must be resolved in an alternative dispute resolution procedure or by a neutral adjudicator, usually a judge. Because of its imprecision ordinary course of business disputes are usually less costly than alternative dispute resolution procedures, but the process is often cumbersome and slow. Large organizations often have ordinary course of business procedures in place but they may also have a dedicated team of professionals who specialize in ordinary course of business resolution. Such teams may use a variety of strategies to help find a resolution of ordinary course of business disputes that works for all parties. Specialized methods for resolving ordinary course of business disputes can include comprehensive reviews of documents, many of which may be pre-contractual, negotiation and compromise. Regardless of the approach used, the process for ordinary course of business dispute resolution can often be time-consuming, cost-prohibitive and quite contentious, but it does allow the disputing parties to resolve their dispute without resorting to alternative dispute resolution procedures and without the threat of immediate legal action. Ordinary course of business resolution procedures can vary significantly between jurisdictions and organizations, so businesses should consult with legal or other specialized experts to learn how their ordinary course of business disputes are typically resolved. Large organizations may have dedicated teams for ordinary course of business dispute resolution because they may have large ordinary course of business bills, but smaller organizations can also use specialized teams to help avoid or resolve ordinary course of business disputes. Ordinary course of business dispute resolution can be a useful process to resolve disputes between parties without resorting to court or alternative dispute resolution procedures and without the threat of immediate legal action. There are procedural and evidentiary rules that do not apply in ordinary course of business dispute resolution, which means ordinary course of business dispute resolution procedures can be more flexible than alternative dispute resolution procedures or court trials. An example of a special rule that does not apply in ordinary course of business dispute resolution is the \"Dead Man's Act\" in common law jurisdictions, which means a witness who has personal knowledge of the matter in dispute cannot take an adverse position or make a statement that is contrary to the position he or she claimed to hold when the witness was examined during the course of the investigation. When the participants in an ordinary course of business dispute resolution procedure are not the parties to the contract they are trying to resolve, these rules do not apply, and this allows",

    "South Gare lighthouse is a active lighthouse located in South Gare, New South Wales, Australia.The light is situated on a white concrete slab with the traditional iron fungi: pepper tree, and lantern window on the first floor and sweeping views over Port Stephens and The Rip along the Parramatta River. The light was first lit in 1864 and is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The South Gare Light is one of eight man-made lights that line the southern coast of Port Stephens. The light is located on an easel right above the shipping channel, making it very difficult to see in rough seas. Visibility is frequently restricted by the combined height of the light and the smoke from passing ships. Despite this, the lighthouse remains an important navigational aid and is fully operational. The light was first lit in 1864 as part of a major expansion of maritime safety in NSW following the construction of a series of impressive lighthouses along the eastern seaboard. The Parramatta River was the first along the south coastline with the South Gare Lighthouse constructed by the British Government Siverworks Department. The lighthouse is administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, who replaced the light with a more modern structure in 1984. The lighthouse is located on South Gare Head, a promontory that juts out into the Tasman Sea. The area was originally used as a seasonal fishing camp by the Thorsborne family who later established the South Gare Hotel. The hotel burnt down in 1957 and the lighthouse was unoccupied until 1983 when the Land Conservation Council installed a caretaker and began negotiations with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to purchase the lighthouse and land for conservation. The lighthouse was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register in 2008 and is also listed on the Australian Registry of Heritage Places. In 2011, the lighthouse and surrounding land was purchased by Parks Australia, with the intent of establishing a visitors centre and looking after the lighthouse and land for conservation. The current light is a seven-second rotation on and off band of green, red, red, green, red, red, white, red, off. The light characteristic and frequency is displayed in white on the first floor lantern window. In May 2017, the lighthouse was vandalised with a Cutlass Road storm causing significant damage to the roof and destroying part of the lantern. The culprits, who were unable to gain access, were never found. The administration of the lighthouse and surrounding land is now handled by Parks Australia from an on-site caretaker. The lighthouse is open to the public, with the cost of entry covering the lighthouse keepers's salary. Guided tours are available from March to September, with visitors able to explore the grounds and lighthouse and enjoy sweeping views over Port Stephens and The Rip. The lighthouse is a short walk from the car park of the South Gare Head Path, a walking track that leads from the cliffs at The Rocks Crossing to the lighthouse. The lighthouse is a popular vantage point for viewing the sweeping views along The Rocks Crossing that includes the Parramatta River, South Gare Shopping Village and Port Stephens.

    "Charles Camsell (December 25, 1807 – January 27, 1867) was a Canadian businessman and politician. He represented Ontario South in the Legislative Assembly of Canada from 1854 to 1857 as a Liberal. Born in Guysborough, Nova Scotia, the son of Jonathan Camsell and Elizabeth Ann Wall, he was educated there. In 1829, he married Mary McGregor. Camsell came to Upper Canada in 1832, settling in London, Ontario. He became a merchant and manufacturer. In 1833, he founded the London Machine Works. He also helped found the Bank of Upper Canada and the Huron and Erie Canal. Camsell was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1854, serving until 1857. He was reelected in 1857 and 1863 but was defeated in 1866. Camsell served as a justice of the peace and on the town council. He died at London at the age of 65. The Charles Camsell Centre in London, Ontario was named in his honour. en<|endoftext|>The phenomenon of sexual assault continues to dominate the news. Each day brings another report of a predator unchecked and unpunished. We read of a famous athlete, a promising politician, a beloved professor, a gifted student, all accused of assaulting children. And we ask: how could this happen? Yet the answer to that question is perhaps less complicated than we think. Child sexual abuse is a product of our own moral failure as a society. We collectively have not taught boys to be boys; we have not taught girls to be girls. We have not taught sex and violence the boundaries they should keep. As a result, bad things happen. To think more deeply about this moral failure, we must examine what is known about male sexuality. We know that boys’ brains develop differently from girls’ brains. The systems that manage empathy, affiliation, and compassion are underdeveloped. The parts of the brain responsible for moral reasoning, social awareness, and understanding of cause and effect are altogether undeveloped. We also know that our current social construct does not allow for this natural state. We tell them they can’t cry. We tell them they have to act tough. We ask them to do the impossible: be vulnerable and strong at the same time. In order to thrive, boys need to feel both empathy for others and the ability to exert control. But we deprive them of the emotional ability to understand and navigate emotional situations. As a result, boys feel frustrated and shut down. Lastly, we know that many boys are raised by parents who have not been adequately trained in how to parent boys. They use discipline like corporal punishment or humiliation, a natural deterrent to misbehavior in girls, as a means of control in boys. But at that age, the frontal lobe of the brain, where inhibitory control is developed, is not fully developed. When they misbehave, they don’t understand that the anger they are feeling is a sign of the frustration described above. And so, they lash out. When we put this all together, we can begin to understand why boys become sexual predators. The social constructs that reward emotional repression in boys lead to frustration and aggression. These traits, which are innate in many boys, lead them to find an outlet in sexual assault. In short, we have failed to raise boys, and this is what we have produced. The solution is not to punish or shame boys for what is a failure of our societal norms. We need to reform our social norms. We need to raise both boys and girls with clear standards of appropriate behavior, and we need to teach boys that emotional expression is an important aspect of who they are, not something to be hidden away. As a result of that change, we will see fewer assaults by boys on boys and more assaults on girls by boys. We will reduce the gender gap in assault rates. However, it will not end there. As long as we tell girls they can’t cry or express their fear, we will see boys assaulted for expressing their true selves. Boys will assault girls for two reasons: 1) girls have been taught their authentic expression is unacceptable, and 2) boys feel they have permission to do so, as long as they are “asserting themselves.” By changing the way we raise boys, we are indirectly attacking this second form of assault. But it will not end there. When we tell boys they cannot be who they are, we create boys who will assault boys in the same way they were assaulted by others. We have a much more complicated problem than we first realized. Fighting sexual assault is important. But when we think about why sexual assault happens, we must also think about how we raise boys and what we expect of them. When we teach girls they can’t cry, we",

The song was very popular on the clubs, it made it to #1 on the U.S. Hot Black Singles and #2 on the U.S. Club Play chart. It also reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was considered a response to the pop music that was popular at the time, especially in the U.S. The song features backing vocals by El'lli, Chico DeBarge, Johnta Austin and Marlin Conwell. Jodeci provided vocals for the song. The song was included on their second studio album The Lynch Project. Lou Johnson was a songwriter who also wrote \"Let's Get Happy\". This song was also covered by American rapper Redman on his album The Onlyché Story. The Spirit of the Boogie (song) was covered by German band Glasperlenspiel on their 1997 album Once Upon a Rhyme. The Spirit of the Boogie was also covered by British R&B singer Gary",
    "Robbie Williams popularized \"Radio\" in 1997. The song was written and produced by bands member Andrew Watt. The song is significant as it made Williams the first British solo male artist since the Beatles to have five singles from one album in the UK charts, and the first British male solo artist since the Beatles to have a number-one single in the US Billboard Hot 100. It also marked Williams' first collaboration with American rapper LL Cool J, and became the first single to exceed one billion views on YouTube. Williams described the inspiration for the song as follows: \"I was looking out of the window of a jet coming back from Singapore and I saw this advert for Pirelli Tires. It said 'Where the ride takes you'. I thought this is a great theme for a song. It's about a guy taking his girl on a journey. It's like a road movie, the song kind of feels like you're taking her with you on a journey.\" Radio became Williams' second number-one single in the United Kingdom, and his sixth and final number-one single in the United States. It was certified platinum or gold in more than 20 countries. The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its \"infectious chorus\", \"memorable verses\" from LL Cool J and Williams' vocals. The song's music video, which features the pair performing the song atop a pink 1963 Jaguar E-Type, won numerous awards and remains one of Williams' most popular and iconic music videos.",
    "The 2003 Maldives civil unrest was a political crisis that began on 28 September 2003 and lasted until 5 October 2003. President Mohamed Nasheed, who was re-elected in 2001, became the target of public anger after introducing emergency legislation. This legislation gave him vast discretionary powers, including the ability to detain people without charge and restrict publications. The Indian government reacted by downgrading its High Commission in Malé from a High Commission to a Consulate General. Protests, led by the Majlis-e-Amal (Movement) party, rapidly spread throughout the Maldives. After several days of demonstrations, thousands of Maldivians took to the streets, forcing Nasheed to resign. A transitional government of opposition leaders was appointed, and a presidential election was held in February 2004. effect Edith holds the view that the 2003 Maldives civil unrest was a trigger for the political unrest of 2012 - 2016. She states that: \"The changing political dynamics in the Maldives had begun with the civil unrest of 2003. The multiple cycles of change began in 2012 when Abdulla Yameen was voted in as President of the Maldives. His first action was to execute an arrest warrant for his predecessor, Mohamed Nasheed, on charges of terrorism. Nasheed had previously been granted asylum in Mooré by the Indian government and was living in exile in New York. The next election, in 2015, was narrowly won by the People’s Alliance, a coalition of the main opposition parties. However, following another indictment for terrorism, this time of his predecessor, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the People’s Alliance boycotted the 2019 election, which was won by the Progressive Party of former president Nasheed. With Gayoom returned to power, protestors once again took to the streets calling for Gayoom’s resignation and a transition to democracy.\"",
    "John Calvin's view of Scripture can be summarized in five points: 1. The Bible is the Word of God 2. It is the written word 3. It is God's word for our instruction 4. all of Scripture is to be taken literally 5. In some places, poetry or mystery was intended John Calvin's view of Scripture focuses on the spoken and written word of God as the inerrant and authoritative source of truth. Do not interpret my word but lay down both what is mine and what was mine, for you preached before my time what I now preach. You already have run well ahead of me, and have left me far behind. Isaiah 56:4 It is not beyond the reach of human capabilities to know the truth, it is a question of will. The Bible is God's instruction for our instruction. He does not want us to remain in ignorance, he wants all mankind to come to know him. Some places in the Bible are poetry or mystery meant to teach a spiritual truth. The miraculous birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus is taken literally. John Calvin (1409-1464) was a renaissance thinker who had a major impact on the theological development of the Protestant church. He stressed the sovereignty of God in all things. He also was an original Editor of the Geneva Bible. He wrote: \"For my part, I desire that all possible precautions be taken to prevent any changes from being made in the text. For it is written: that you may believe that you understand my word which I have not spoken.\"",

    "The Division of Korea was a provisional division of the United Kingdom and France during the Cold War. It was created in 1948 after the separation of the previously unified Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The division existed until 1953 when the two countries agreed to reunify and become one sovereign state. Nonetheless, similar arrangements continue to exist; for example, the two nations share customs and tax arrangements, and are still nominally at war. catalyzed by the partition of the Korean peninsula, the division of Korea was considered a crucial factor in Harry S. Truman's decision to approve the deployment of nuclear weapons in the region. This deployment was later cited as a key motivation for the development of the North Korea nuclear programme. The division of Korea resulted in a state of war between the two countries, as well as the separation of families and communities – many of the tens of thousands of Koreans living in Britain later returned to South Korea to contribute to the fight against the North during the Korean War. According to Patti Smith, \"the division of Korea is one of the most unjust and unrecognized shameful episodes in the history of United States foreign relations\". BEFORE 1948 – Korea was a colony of Japan, which ruled the country from 1910 until the Japan's surrender to the Allied powers at the end of World War II in 1945. Following the Soviet Union's intervention in the war on the side of the Soviet-backed North Korean Workers' Party, the country was divided at the 38th parallel into a U.S. zone (under American military supervision) and a Soviet zone. 1948 – The U.S. and Soviet Union established the United Nations Security Council Resolution 84, establishing the division of Korea, and simultaneously the two countries established the military alliance, the Korean Armistice Agreement. The two sides agreed to remain neutral until each reached \"universal peace\", and engaged in a state of war since 1948.",

    "Jody Harris (born Jody Christine Egerton; 21 October 1940 – 5 January 2017) was an English singer, songwriter and record producer, whose career began in the early 1960s, and included four UK top 10 singles and five UK top 20 albums. She was part of the British Invasion group the Four Seasons. Born and raised in Birmingham, England, Harris was inspired to become a singer after seeing her first movie, John Gilbert's 1944 film noir Better Than Well, at the age of 11. After winning a talent contest at the Midland amateur music festival, she was signed to Decca Records. Her early recordings were covers of material by American artists such as Eddie Cochran and the Andrews Sisters. In early 1964, she was invited to join the Four Seasons, the original group whose lineup later included Bob Gaudio and Vini Poncia. The group's early hits, \"And lo, Cudiwa!!\", \"BBmania\", and the number 2 UK single \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\". were all written by Gaudio and Harris. In 1966, the band achieved their first number 1 with \"1970\". Harris sang lead on most of the Four Seasons' hits, with the exception of \"Who's Sorry Now\", which was sung by Bob Gaudio. In later years she described her role as a lead singer on the band's hits as \"demeaning\", and blamed it for her later alcohol abuse. By the time of their breakup in 1971, Harris had become addicted to amphetamines, barbiturates, and tranquilizers. Following her rehabilitation in 1976, she moved to West Germany and became a songwriter, producer and actor.",
    "The Breit equation is an empirical formula, first published in 1936, for calculating the wavelength of an X-ray photon given the energy of the photon, the speed of light c, the electron rest mass m0, the reduced Planck constant h, and the helicity angle of the photon. The equation is: where is the helicity angle in units of radians, is the energy of the photon in electronvolts, and and are empirically determined constants for the element under investigation. The equation is named after its creator, Walter Rudolph Breit. While the original derivation of the equation is attributed to Breit, later work showed that the equation was already contained in a 1925 paper by Pieter Hendrik van der Linde. In quantum electrodynamics, the equation is used to predict the energy and wavelength of photons resulting from the electromagnetic interaction of electrons and other particles. The constants in the equation may have different values for different particles, but in that case they are considered to be average values. In general, the smaller the energy of the electron, the larger the value of, but for high-energy electrons is nearly equal to 2. The constant varies by approximately a factor of 4 depending on the particle, but for most particles it is close to 7. The constant is always close to π/2. The reduced Planck constant h is a fundamental constant of quantum mechanics related to the action of the Dirac gamma matrices. It is equivalent to 2.97 (±0.02)×10−15 J s, where the error is one standard deviation among different determinations. This empirical formula correctly describes the observed behaviour of photons in many situations. However, it is a first-order approximation only and does not include some higher-order effects such as the electron magnetic moment. These effects would require including second-order terms in. In nuclear and particle physics, the analogous equations for particles other than electrons are the C virial equation or Gamow–Teller relation, respectively, for the nuclear shell model and the Fermi-Watson theorem for Quantum Field Theory. This empirical formula is used in many fields of physics and other sciences. It is used for example in x-ray fluorescence analysis, in calculating the energy of gamma rays from nuclear decay, and in calculating the wavelength of light emitted by stars. The constant is significant for optical polarizers, which use the differential absorption of light of different polarizations to generate separation of light into its components. As the constant is not the same for all polarizations, the polarizers are designed to have a thickness which alters the polarization such that is roughly constant across the cross section of the polarizer. The constants and are related to the fine structure of the hydrogen atom. The constant is very important in Casimir physics, in particular the Casimir–Polder force, and also plays a significant role in QED in general. The constants and are of great significance in quantum chemistry, nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic physics, and also play a significant role in QED in general. The Breit equation is also used in biochemistry in the calculation of circular dichroism spectra. In statistics, the equation is used in the calculation of the moments of the normal distribution. The Breit equation is also useful in multiple proofs of the Handshu lemma in combinatorics, and is a special case of the generating function equation for the distribution of cycle lengths in a random permutation. In geometry, the equation is used to solve for the golden ratio. The equation can be used to estimate the magnetic field of a proton in molecular dynamics simulations. The equation can be used to estimate the refractive index of a material. In finance, the equation can be used to estimate the value of a options contract. In the music industry, the equation is used by iTunes and similar music distributors to estimate the bit rate of an audio recording in order to fit it into a given file format. Breit's constant also affects the periodicity of light emitted by the so-called blinking quantum dots. The equation is used to correct X-ray spectra taken at synchrotrons by the SPB (Stokes-polarization-breakthrough) method for depolarization. The equation is also used to calculate the temperature of the white dwarf stars using a model based on the treatment of the star as an electrically conducting sphere. The equation is used in the introduction to the Photon Atom model in the CALSM 2.0 Monte Carlo code for calculating the interactions between photons and atoms or molecules. In fluid dynamics, the equation can be used to estimate the Reynolds number of a fluid flow. The Breit equation also has applications in pattern",

    "D-3 (video) is a high resolution television video standard, created by the Japanese broadcasting organization NHK. It has 1,080 lines, nearly three times the resolution of standard def TV sets. D-3 was created in response to the higher definition television standards of the time, such as high definition television (HDTV) and DBS (direct broadcast satellite). The name D-3 refers to the third generation of the D-2ideo standard, which was created in 1964. The D-3 standard was officially launched on March 14, 2002. The first D-3 compliant receivers were fielded by the end of April of the same year. D-3 videos have 10 times more picture information than SD videos, and can show live footage from remote locations with no degradation of image quality. They are used for broadcasting as well as for professional applications. Since 2010, the D-3 video standard has been incorporated into the High Definition Video Coding Standard (HDVS), which is maintained by the International Telecommunication Union and the Broadcasting Equipment Manufacturers Association. D-3 videos can be played on dedicated D-3 decoders, but they can also be decoded and displayed by more general DVD players and video receivers after employing a mastering process. As of early 2020, only a few broadcasters worldwide have plans to broadcast in the D-3 standard, especially those with coverage in North America.

He was a patron of the Brahmi script and the first known Chalukyan king to be known by that name, rather than by his royal title alone. He established a Hindu court administration, and is credited with codifying the laws of the land. Historians have argued about the extent of his contribution to these laws, and whether they should be called \"Chalukyan\" laws at all, since the terminology was not established until many years after his death. His son Someshvara I (c. 975 – 1010 CE) continued his father's program of military expansion, pushing the Chalukya frontier up to Khandesh and Kullkund in present-day Madhya Pradesh. He also strengthened the administration, extending the use of the Brahmi script to contract obligations and exchange valuables. Adityavarman's court was remembered for its justice. Historian K. A. Norman writes: The records of his time contain no trace of oppression or exaction. There were well-defined laws, and they were enforced. \"Shield and protection\" was the national motto of the people. The forms of trial by jury, and the administration of justice by officers of the law, were well known. The king was not only the chief magistrate, but a law-abiding man, whose subjects had every reason to hope for justice from his hands.",

    "Second-order cybernetics is a field of study originating from the work of Götz Hermann Nitterbeck and Edward Tolman. It focuses on higher order dynamics of systems and patterns of behavior. It is related to but distinct from first order cybernetics, which focuses on system level analysis of technical systems. Second order cybernetics was defined by Nitterbeck and Tolman as the study of \" organisms--that is, of entities that act, evolve, and interact in such a way that they acquire an organized structure and give rise to new and sometimes unexpected and confusing to either their producer or themselves, novel structures, patterns, and systemic relationships\". Nitterbeck and Tolman introduced the concept of \"levels of systemic organization\" in which first order cybernetic concepts such as monitors, readings, and responses apply to the lowest level or level one ( autonomic nervous system and instinctual behavior). Level two (adaptation) and level three ( evolution) apply to systems of increasing complexity, while level four ( transformation) is applied to self-sustaining systems that exhibit self-modifying behavior. Second-order cybernetics focuses on level two and three evolution and interaction, between agent and environment, that give rise to novel systemic structures and patterns. Second-order cybernetics has been used to analyze a wide range of areas including social organizations, organizations, biological systems, and urban systems. It is still an active area of research today and has been used to analyze topics such as patterns of technological innovation, globalization, and the emergence of new social forms such as global non state actors.",

    "Future Worlds are a series of exhibitions held by the Imagine Media Group, an international media, entertainment and licencing company. The first Future Worlds exhibition was held in 2013 in Japan. The second exhibition was held in China in 2017. Future Worlds exhibitions are typically hosted in Japan and China once every five years, with the next exhibition scheduled in 2023 in Japan. The exhibitions provide a glimpse into what world culture might look like in the future, allowing visitors the chance to see, touch and purchase products from different cultures from around the world. Exhibitions have included travel between parallel universes, such as theFuture Worlds Tokyo 2017 exhibition featured a recreation of Times Square in New York City, complete with a Lego model of the New York Times Building. The exhibition also featured a recreation of the Las Vegas Strip, with a Lego model of the Trump International Hotel and Tower at its heart. Other universes featured at Future Worlds exhibitions include 1940s retro-futuristic environments, steampunk technology and exo-suit inspired designs. Each universe has its own particular fashion, technology, law, language and social behaviour. Visitors to the exhibitions are usually children, as the exhibits are intended to stimulate their imagination and curiosity. Future Worlds exhibitions are not endorsed by any official body, and are not formally recognised as genuine science-fiction.

The first exhibition was held in Nippon ( Japan) because it is the home of science fiction in Japan, which includes such iconic writers as Susumu H Simon, Stanislaw Lem, Noriko Kujo, Eriol Silber and Haruka Shiraishi.",
    "Lucius Cary, 6th Viscount Falkland (1584 – 21 March 1633) was an English soldier and politician who became a favourite of King James I and was made a Baron of England. He fought for the King during the Spanish invasion of England in 1589 and served as a Justice of the Peace for Somersetshire from 1594. He was made a Viscount in 1613. However his support for the King led to his prosecution for high treason after the English Restoration and he was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released from prison in 1628 but died shortly afterwards. He was the son of Sir Philip Cary and Mary Boleyn and the grandson of Sir Francis Cary, who was the son-in-law of King Henry VIII. Lucius Cary was a member of the House of Commons from 1597 to 1629 and became a supporter of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. He fought for the King at the Battle of Edgehill, the first battle of the war, in October 1539. In 1599 he was made a colonel in the English Army and served under the Earl of Essex in the Netherlands. He was given the custody of South Wales by the Earl of Southampton and was sent by the King to Ireland as Deputy Lieutenant. In 1613 he was created a baron and was made a Justice of the Peace for Somersetshire. In 1616 he was sent to Rome to seek papal approval of the King's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and returned with a dispensation to marry Elizabeth Peckham, whose father was physician to the Pope. In 1617 he was elected a member of the Privy Council of England and the following year the King made him Earl of Carlisle and Viscount Falkland.

    "Colombian spider monkey (i.e. Abetadebola simiescana colombiana) is a species of New World monkey found in South America in the Amazon rainforest and typically lives in pairs or small groups. Their habitat is restricted to lowland rainforests with mid level to tall trees. Spider monkeys are relatively small monkeys with light brown or grey fur. They have slender limbs with long fingers and toes but no tail. In terms of morphology they are very similar to howard monkeys (genus howardii). Spider monkeys eat fruit, tree leaves and flowers and are relatively peaceful monkeys. They live in stable groups with a adult dominant male and several females and their young. Due to their similarities to howard monkeys and their habitat requirements they are classified as a vulnerable species by the World Conservation Union. The total population is unknown but is estimated to be between 100,000 and 250,000 individuals. Spider monkeys were described as a new species in 1776 by German naturalist Georg Marcgraf. They are named for their small size, slender limbs, and their appearance in habitats with trees, such as trees with low branches. They are not closely related to howard monkeys, whose habitat is in higher-light conditions. Spider monkeys are classified in the family Aotidae, and the subfamily Catarrhini, alongside humans and other primates. Spider monkeys are vulnerable to collision with electric power lines and armed conflict with humans. They live in small groups which increases the risk of mortality when individuals separate from their group. Their habitat is also under threat from deforestation. Despite this, spider monkeys have large geographic ranges and a large population, and are listed as vulnerable by the World Conservation Union. They are hunted for their meat and also threatened by habitat destruction.",

    "The Eurosignal is a proposed European Union wide signal that could be used as an early warning system for cross border critical situations, such as terrorist attacks or nuclear threats from countries such as Iran. The current signals include the Great Firewall of China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. These threats can be communicated through alternative means such as social media or private channels, but a unified early warning system would provide faster response times and be more convenient for citizens and officials. The Eurosignal should be easier to understand than existing early warning systems such as the Comprehensive National Emergency Network. The Eurosignal consists of a set of physical signals, defined as codes, which will be emitted by the EU executive after a majority vote. These codes would be received by automated monitoring stations in the EU27 and a new network of signal intelligence centres. The monitoring stations would pass the signals on to other security agencies, such as intelligence services and border controls. The system would also use biometric and other identifiers to ensure that the signals were not spoofed. The advantages of the Eurosignal compared to existing early warning systems include increased speed and convenience, as well as improved privacy. The Eurosignal would also improve surveillance of non-EU countries, such as Iran, because the EU would be able to monitor communications from monitoring stations inside their own territory. EU citizens would also receive some protection, as the signals could not be used to send private messages without the sender's consent. Critics of the Eurosignal claim that it would centralise too much power in the hands of the EU executive. The monitoring stations, operating within the EU but outside of Schengen, would be an additional network for the EU, raising the likelihood of bureaucratic duplication. The limited capacity of the monitoring stations, which could handle up to 20 000 signals per day, would also limit the number of situations that could be monitored. The main advantage of this approach is that it would be cheaper and more convenient than building new monitoring stations. The decision to spend money on the Eurosignal would have to be taken unanimously by the EU27.",

    "Julie Lescaut (née Julie Aubert; French: [jo loue]; 19 February 1844 – 13 July 1898) was a French author of the nouveau roman era. Her real name was Julie Aubert and she was born and died in Paris. One of the first professional women novelists, she wrote characteristically sensual and provocative works with biting social commentary that were controversial when published because of their sexual explicitness and shocking content. Lescaut is best known for her 1885 novel L'Assommoir, which received the first Prix Goncourt, and won the first Paul de Pand constructed Prix Tourney. Her first husband was the journalist Émile Zola, with whom she had a daughter, Claude. After separating from Zola, she married the military officer Georges Lescaut and had two more daughters, Denise and Georgette. Lescaut spent most of her adult life struggling to support herself and her family through her writing. She was unsentimental in her portraits of the poor and the marginalized, and often used prostitution and other extreme examples of societal failings to make her points. In the late 1880s, she turned to activism and began writing about socialist and anarchist topics. She died of uremic poisoning at age 55, a victim of her life's work as a reporter. Lescaut's literary reputation was largely established during the 20th century, with major reprintings of L'Assommoir in the United States and Britain in the 1930s and 1940s, the establishment of a cult following in the 1950s and 1960s, and the publication of several collections of her journalism in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant to Lescaut's legacy is her inclusion in the 1985 French film adaptation of L'Assommoir, directed by Deniz Gamal and featuring Daniel Auteuil in the lead role. The film's producers were so impressed that they created the Prix Julie Lescaut, awarded every two years to the French filmmaker representing an individual approach to cinematography. Actress Sophie Charlotte stars in a fictionalized film version of Lescaut's life, L'Exceptionnel, which premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.",

The firm said in a new report that consumers could be entitled to refunds if they had paid for broadband services on the NBN but had their connections moved off-chain onto the Merkata network, which doesn't deliver the speeds promised on NBN contracts. “Customers who subscribe to NBN services through both the NBN and Merkata will potentially be entitled to a refund of all monies paid for NBN services on a pro rata basis,” Deloitte partner Michael Jackson said in the report. In other words, customers would have paid for services that never materialised. Deloitte said that despite NBN Co choosing to move off the existing National Broadband Network (NBN) infrastructure onto Merkata, which is an independent network with no affiliation to NBN Co, NBN Co’s contracts with retail service providers (RSPs) remained binding. If NBN Co moves customers off the Merkata network back onto the NBN, the contracts would be invalid because customers would have paid for services that never materialised, the report said. “If NBN Co wishes to maintain these contracts with RSPs, NBN Co will be required to pay the RSPs the full upfront fees they received from RSPs for the services provided to NBN customers on Merkata,” it said. NBN Co has previously stated that “99.7 per cent” of customers will retain their chosen NBN speed, whether they change their contracts to Merkata or not. The report said that because NBN Co had not made it clear that RSPs were not entitled to the full fees for services provided on the Merkata network, NBN Co may not have breached the RSPs' contracts. But if NBN Co does breach the contracts, consumers could be owed refunds, the report said. NBN Co may not be able to avoid all liability to refunds. For example, refunds may be warranted where NBN Co’s decision to move customers off-chain onto Merkata has caused service outages or data congestion on Merkata. This would depend on what NBN Co has told customers about its move to Merkata,” the report said. \"NBN Co’s move to Merkata\" Merkata is an independent network with no affiliation to NBN Co, although NBN Co is responsible for rolling out the network and taking customer service calls. NBN Co said that Merkata was a “valid testing mechanism” that allowed it to run more “full speed services” on the network. “Merkata is not intended to be or become an operational network or business, and customers should not conclude or assume that NBN Co’s services are provided or offered on Merkata,” NBN Co said. NBN Co said that if it moved a customer off-Merkata back onto the NBN it would be at the customer’s request, and the fees would be adjusted accordingly. Deloitte partner Jackson said that NBN Co should “clearly communicate” the",

    "Arachniotus ruber is a species of spider in the family Theraphosidae found in Chile and Argentina. The name 'Arachniotus' comes from the Greek word for spider and the species' Latin name. It is one of the six species of spider in the genus Arachniotus, the others being: - Arachniotus brucei - Arachniotus coronatus - Arachniotus granulatus - Arachniotus hortense - Arachniotus imperator - Arachniotus octavius A. ruber has a light brown body with a pattern of cream and brown chevrons and transverse bands on its back. It is most similar to Arachniotus brucei, A. coronatus, A. granulatus and A. imperator but can be distinguished from them by the pattern of its body and the lack of spines on its abdomen. A. ruber lives in silken retreats it spins under leaves and in rotten wood and can also spin pre-made retreats. It is not considered to be dangerous to humans. A. ruber was described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1857 with the type locality given as \"Chile, Santiago\". A. ruber was also found in Argentina for the first time in 2005 but was thought to be rare and was listed as 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However further study showed that its range did not overlap with the potential range of the more critically endangered A. brucei and that the true population size of A. ruber was significantly larger than previous estimates, making it a 'least-concern' species rather than 'Critically Endangered'. Further study also showed that A. ruber was not dangerous and was actually able to prey on other spiders including members of its own genus. It is found in forests with moderate to high levels of humidity.",

    "Gdańsk Przymorze-Uniwersytet is a railway station in Gdańsk, Poland, located in the city centre near the University of Gdańsk campus and the Round Tower. It is a major transportation hub with access to the Gdańsk Port Tunnel and Słupsk railway station, as well as regional trains and metropolitan buses. The terminal is located near the international ferry to Tozonjab, the only international ferry operating out of Gdańsk. The first train arrived in Gdańsk on May 19, 1857, and the terminal was inaugurated on December 20 of the same year. Originally named Przymorze (Przymorz), it was renamed Gdańsk Przymorze in 1965. In 2011 the station was extensively renovated, including a new, larger ticketing hall, waiting room, and customer service area as well as better accessibility, lighting, and security. The station is owned by PKP, and as of 2014 had an average of 18,000 passengers per day, the highest on the Gdańsk–Hel railway. It is the northern terminus of the Gdańsk Śródmieście (Gdańsk City Centre) line and the southern terminus of the Słupsk Ring Conway line. Additional lines serving the terminal include regional trains to Bydgoszcz, Elbląg, Łódź, Poznań, Słupsk, Warsaw, and Zielona Góra as well as six metro lines and several U-Bahn lines. Gdańsk Przymorze is located in the heart of the city close to the Round Tower, at ul. Długa 54-100, in the economic region of Zachód Gdańsk. It is easily accessible by public transportation: several regional and metropolitan buses depart from in front of the station, and many metropolitan railway lines as well as U-Bahn lines pass nearby. The main station hall is located on the first floor, and accessible via the main entrance, underground passage, or an elevator. There are also several service areas, including a pharmacy, bank, and newsagent. A 2015 expansion plan included a new passenger terminal, additional parking lots, and improved accessibility. An additional access to the station is being planned to serve as an interchange with the city's proposed high-speed train. The PKP headquarters, as well as the offices of the Gdańsk Port Authority, are located in the Przymorze station complex. The terminal is a popular meeting place for tourists, due to its close proximity to the Old Town and the city centre restaurant and nightlife district. It is frequently featured in Polish postcard exhibitions, and it is a popular filming location for films and television shows. The station was entered on the List of World Heritage Sites in 2017 as one of 18 remaining railway stations designed by Henryk Tahla. Although the terminal has been renovated several times since 2011, it still lacks several modern facilities. The waiting rooms are small, uncomfortable, and of variable cleanliness, with some disabled access lacking. The ticketing hall is also small and crowded, with ticket machines taking up most of the available space. Connections to the Internet and domestic long distance calls are also difficult to find. There are also complaints that customer service is unhelpful or even hostile, although the number of complaints has decreased in recent years. Gdańsk Przymorze-Uniwersytet is well-maintained and clean, with professional staff, adequate facilities, and an ambiance suitable for a busy transportation hub. It is well-used by tourists and city residents, and serves as a popular meeting place for locals and tourists alike. It is also the headquarters of the PKP Group, one of Poland's largest transportation companies. In 2021, the Przymorze station complex was transferred from the PKP to the city of Gdańsk under a joint-stock company, funded by a loan from the European Union. After the expiration of the loan, full ownership will be transferred to the city, and the company will become a shareholder. In 2023, the city planned to invest PLN 170 million in renovating and extending the Przymorze station complex, to bring it in line with current high-tech standards. The Polish government has considered renaming the terminal as part of a planned expansion of the national railway network. The idea has been strongly opposed by the city and local organizations, who consider the name recognitionable by the Polish public. In 2023, the city proposed the following names for the new lines being planned: \"Orange\", after the city's most popular street and transportation brand; \"Black Aspen\", after the",

The tree produces edible fruits that are a common food of the espindáquiya indigenous tribe in Brazil. The species is native to the northern part of South America, from Bolivia and Brazil through Paraguay to Uruguay. In Portuguese-speaking regions of Brazil the tree is called Salvileiro. In Portugal the tree is called Índigo and it is sometimes called arroubadina. In Romania it is called leapa, in Italy maschera di provolone, in Spain alibóndigo and in French France : chênaie. The wood of the tree is used to make pulp for papermaking and it is also used in construction. The edible fruits of the tree are purplish-black, roughly spherical, roughly a centimeter in diameter, with a mildly astringent flavor. They are edible and are generally consumed fresh, though they can also be used to make jellies, jams, and preserves. The seeds are also edible and are used in confectionery and for planting. The wood of the tree is moderately resistant to decay, the tree can grow to a height of 10 metres (33 feet) with a spread of up to 18 metres (60 feet). The Azevedo tree is an important species in the Upper Amazonia forest, where it can often be found near rivers. The seeds have a great potential for germination after several years, even if they were collected soon after flowering. Azevedo is of Greek and Spanish origin, coming from acommon root perhaps borrowed from an even earlier language.

    "Eucalyptus olsenii, is a species of mallee tree, that is native to Australia. It has attractive red flowers, and releases a chemical that makes it water repellant. It is also an important habitat for koala bears. 797 words Introduction Eucalyptus olsenii is a mallee tree, also known as the red mallee, that is native to Australia. It has attractive red flowers, and releases a chemical that makes it water repellant. It is also an important habitat for koala bears. History Eucalyptus olsenii has been scientifically described in 1998 by Ken Hill and Bryan Adams, based on material collected near Cape Riche. In 1999, Hill and Adams published the names of two subspecies, E. o. subsp. olsenii and E. o. subsp. stenopetala. A closely related tree with a similar range is Eucalyptus regnans, the Queensland mallet, which has pink flowers and is not repellant to water. Ecology Eucalyptus olsenii is an important habitat for a number of animals, including the threatened black-headed flying fox, the common wombat, the brushtail possum, the koala and the ring-tailed possum. The tree is itself an important habitat for mallee fowl and the western barred bandicoot. Releases of the chemical malleilactone make the tree water repellant.",

    "The Charles Sumner House, located at 1516 8th Avenue in Portland, Oregon, was built in 1901 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It was the home of Charles Sumner, a United States Senator from 1895 to 1905 and again from 1913 to 1917, and also served as his law office. Sumner was a leading spokesman for racial equality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his support for the Republicans in the Senate eventually led to his truce with President Andrew Johnson, an end to Reconstruction, and ultimately his dismissal from the Republican Party. The house was renovated and expanded in 1936 in the Classical Revival style. Sumner was born in Boston, a descendant of Paul Revere, and attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College. He began his career in journalism and moved to New York City in 1859, where he became a correspondent for the New York Times, and also wrote for The Illustrated American, a journal published by Edgar Allan Poe. He resigned his position with the Times in 1861 to fight in the Civil War, enlisting in the Army as a private in the 19th Massachusetts Infantry. He was appointed Assistant Inspector General in the Army of the James after the war, and then served in various political positions in Massachusetts, first as a Republican, then as a Democrat and finally as a Liberal Republican. Sumner moved to Portland, Oregon in 1872 and began teaching mathematics and science at Jefferson High School. In 1876, he co-founded The Oregonian with George Lawrence May and Josepharas Barnes, and he became known for his oratory in the House of Representatives and the Oregon Senate. He resigned from The Oregonian in 1881 and started a private law practice, but his legislative work was not limited to Oregon. In 1894, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Sumner United States Ambassador to Japan, and he served in this post from June 1895 to March 1897. Sumner returned to Oregon in 1897 to take a seat in the Senate, where he would represent the state for six terms, serving from 1895 to 1917. In 1901, Sumner purchased the lot and built the present house, which he lived in until his death in 1922. He left the house to his daughters, and one of them, Augusta (1865-1941) lived in the house until her death. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and it is located within the boundaries of the Chinatown neighborhood. It is one of the few standing Classical Revival residences in the neighborhood.

    "Rondout Creek is an tributary of the Schoharie Creek that flows through Dutchess and Columbia counties in New York State. The Rondout Creek flows into the east side of the Hudson River in Ulster County near the town of Palermo. The Rondout Creek is one of two primary westward flowing streams in the vicinity of the city of Hudson. The other is the Unadilla River, a small tributary of the later. The Rondout Creek is southeast of the Unadilla River watershed. The Rondout Creek is an unusual stream in that it has two names. The portion north of the county line is called the North Branch Rondout Creek. The portion south of it is called the South Branch Rondout Creek. The stream was named Rondout during the original land grant to the Holland Land Company in 1664, when it was called Rondwert (Rondout+wert,'round or circular [stream]'). The North Branch Rondout Creek was called the Wawbeque Beaver Kill, a Beaver Kill that crossed the Beaver Kill River to become the Rondout Creek. The Rondout Creek is also unusual in its water supply. It is one of the few streams in the region that retains natural springs instead of relying on meltwater from the surrounding hills. This is possible due to the tectonic activity which formed the Hudson Valley during the breakup of Pangaea. During the Ice Ages, glaciers blocking the previous valley of the Rondout Valley, which was eventually filled with lake Agassiz water. After the glaciers melted, they left damns at different places in the valley which formed the natural springs. The Rondout Creek is the most important of these streams, since it flows directly into the Hudson River.",

    "Geology of Libya -------------------- Libya is an African country on the southwestern corner of the Mediterranean Sea, north of Egypt and south of Chad. Libya has a small unicellular tradition of mountains, which are largely illiterate from tectonic activity. Libya's continental crust, which is about twice the thickness of the average African country, is enriched in heavy metals such as uranium and thorium, which are made slightly more abundant due to the relatively high level of granite in the country's rock make-up. Libya is not a seismically active country and there are no recent earthquakes with significant effects on human settlements. However, the Cyrene foundation stone was laid on the site of the ancient city of Cyrene in Libya, and the city was home to one of the world's largest Carnac stones, which commemorates Greek prisoners of war. Libya has many natural gas fields and was thought to have significant amounts of oil, but in 2011 these reserves were found to be insignificant. Geography Libya's climate is tropical and temperate. The southern areas have a desert climate, while the northern areas have a Mediterranean climate. Wildlife in Libya includes cheetahs, leopards, desert wolves, mountain caracals, golden jackals, vervet monkeys, rock rabbits, scops owls, European honey buzzards, bald ibises, red-tailed hawks, and barn owls.

    "History of Rockland County, New York (1798–1900) Rockland County was formed on March 4, 1798 from portions of Montgomery and St. Lawrence counties. It was originally located at the southern end of the New York frontier, and was intended to attract Germans to settle there and populate the entire county. The county has always had a rural character, being devoted to agriculture. Due in part to its rural character and the fertility of the soil, Rockland has been the home of many well-known corporations, including the confectionary company Harmon Mills and the tobacco company Yonkers Raceway. Rockland was the site of the Pequonnock River ferry, which became the first train station in New York on December 9, 1832. The village of Ramapo was founded on December 9, 1839, and soon became a major transportation and industrial center of northern Rockland County. Ramapo is still a center of industry today, particularly in the field of health services. Ramapo College was founded in 1855, and for many years was the only institution of higher education in Rockland County. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Rockland became a prime destination for many African-American travelers who came to northern New York to pursue the freedom afforded by its environs after the end of the Civil War. Though Rockland has had a small black population since its founding, the period from the late 19th century to the 1940s saw an influx of new residents from the south, and as a result Rockland today is home to the largest black community in the state, as well as a large West Indian population. In 1901, Rockland County became the first county in New York to pass an anti-lynching law, which made it a crime to incite or participate in lynchings. Rockland was also the first county in the United States to establish a children's court, which adjudicated cases involving children. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Rockland was home to many artistic communities. Puppet theaters thrived in particular, with several nationally-known troupes making their home in the county. This phenomenon gained nationwide attention in 1947 when famed puppet theater Pell's Moving Picture Houses released the Oscar-winning animated short \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Through much of the 19th and 20th centuries, Rockland was home to a vibrant Jewish population, and is home to the largest population of any Jewish community in the United States without a fully- operating congregation in the Union for Reform Judaism's kosher certification system, although the modern day reform movement was founded in Rockland. On March 1, 1899, what was then the southern part of Rockland County was split off to form Orange County. Since that time, Rockland County has remained one of the poorest counties in New York, with large areas of the county having historically been devoted to agriculture. The county has largely remained rural and suburban in nature, with the largest suburban areas being located around Ramapo and New City. Ramapo is still the largest municipality by land area in the county.",
    "Hippotes is an extinct genus of large primitive carnivorous therapsids, which lived in what is now Middle Asia (formerly Bashkortostan) during the Early Jurassic period. Hippotes was about the size of a rhinoceros and probably hunted large prey with rapid Charging moves similar to those of the modern cape elephant. It has been suggested that the evolution of large body size in carnivorous therapsids may have been rapid, due to the smaller amount of available prey in the early Jurassic. Advertisement for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which takes place approximately 30 years after the events of Episode 4: A New Hope, reveals that \"Jar Jar Binks\" was an endangered species and that his kind was hunted by the Galactic Empire. Gallery Release date information Episode 4: A New Hope was released in 1977, indicating that the Empire was established around that time. 30 years later, in 2013, the character Jar Jar Binks was introduced in The Force Awakens, suggesting that the Jedi were defeated around 2023. Therefore, the time between Jar Jar Binks' creation and his appearance in The Force Awakens is 13 years, which is consistent with the estimated time between 2015 and 2023, the latter of which is the year in which The Force Awakens was released. Just like the primate genus Apathus, Hippotes was created as athrowaway character to explain a plot hole (the seemingly-inexplicable presence of a large and seemingly-obsolete species on a relatively backward planet). In fact, the name of the therapsid genus is a parody of the word Hippocrates, which means \"healing doctor\". Life on Hippotos Originally created by author Michael Crichton, Hippotes was based on the large, docile species Diceratherium, which at the time was the largest known rhino. It had large, tusk-like canines that it used to fight off lions and attack elephants. Disease and natural disaster killed off most of Hippotos' large, land-dwelling animals, and the remaining Hippotos' species began to resort to hunting smaller prey in the water and on land in order to survive. The loss of their large predators lead to Hippotos becoming an endangered species. So, Hippotes was actually a legitimate scientific name, and not a throwaway parody as many people seem to think. You can see where this is going. A large, docile, endangered prehistoric rhino with tusk-like canines would make for an excellent plush toy for the discerning child or (better yet) dog. You can purchase a plush Hippotes at the NASCAQ stock exchange (therapsid division). Film adaptations The rhino from the original novel has made the jump to film at least twice: * The Mummy \"Dracula Has Risen From the Grave\" (1968) * Tales of the Volumes: The Ghost in the Invisible Mask (1984) A number of other adaptations have featured rhinos in either the main title sequence or as a cameo: * The Pink Panther (1976) * Waterloo Station (1978) * The Monster Squad (1985) * Caddyshack (1988) * The NeverEnding Story (1984) * The Land Before Time (1988) * Dave the Barbarian (2000) * The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008) * Hotel Transylvania (2012) * The Lone Ranger (2013) * Storks (2015) * The LEGO Movie (2014) * Wild (2015) * The Cat in the Hat (2016) * Dino Genes (2017) * The Addams Family (2018) * How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2020) Reception Hippotes has received mixed reviews since being introduced in The Force Awakens. Many viewers criticized the character of Jar Jar Binks, with many alleging that the character was racist and that the character was the reason that people did not watch The Force Awakens. Rhino-sized revenge In Episode 10 of the 2019 Cartoon Network series She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, \"The Return of Jared,\" the character Big Mclittle surprised the inhabitants of Thar and left them with a bold request for restitution.

    "Haplocochlias bellus, also known as the zig-zag octopus or dwarf octopus, is a small deep-sea octopus species in the family Octopodidae. It was the first animal species to be discovered by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) via remotely operated submersible, the Deep-Submergence Vehicle (DSV) ALV-3. The H. bellus dive range is 2,300 meters (7,200 feet) and their typical temperature range is 29.5 °C to 15.5 °C (85 °F to 60 °F). The octopus' habitat is widely considered to be one of the deepest-living habitats on the planet. H. bellus are unique among octopuses in a number of ways. For one, H. bellus is the only octopus species with chromatophores only in the skin, not inside the body. Second, although H. bellus is a large-sized octopus, it has thin arms, and the total weight of an adult H. bellus is less than 1% of its body weight. Third, the H. bellus has an unusual lifestyle: it not only sits motionless on the seafloor with eyes pointed down, but it can also change its skin pattern to match the surrounding seafloor. Lastly, the H. bellus can survive out of water for more than six hours. The H. bellus is named after the bell-shaped blotch in the middle of its skin, which is unique in cephalopods. The H. bellus has been studied in greater detail than any other species in the genus Haploctopus. The H. bellus is the first animal species to be discovered by MBARI via the DSV ALV-3, which was named after the Viking god of thunder and wisdom, located in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of California at a depth of 2,300 meters. The H. bellus was also the subject of the documentary film Deep Water: Inside the H. Bellus Discoveries, which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.",

    "Formosa Peak (Chinese: 台島岡; pinyin: Tái Dǐng Góng), originally named Mount Ching after Chiang Kai-shek, is a mountain in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan. The peak overlooks the eastern end of Gulf of Tonkin and is surrounded by Yanchung County to the north, Beitou to the northeast, the Green Island of Lienchiang to the east and the Pingtung County to the southeast. The Formosa Plover nested on the mountain and the peak was renamed after the bird. The mountain is part of Trail 17 in the Taiwan Trail. Trail 17 in the Taiwan Trail is a 2,495-km (1,533-mile) hiking trail from east to west across Taiwan starting and ending in Taipei. The entire trail was awarded Asia's finest long-distance trail in 2008 and forms part of the larger \"Pan-Asia\" long-distance trail. Formosa Peak was the highest point on the original version of the trail, and was the highest point until 2009 when Luojing County Hill was completed. The actual height is higher than the \"Formosa Peak\" by approximately 30m (98ft). The peak is also the highest point in Taiwan, and the third highest peak in the Taipei City limits (after Taipei 101 and Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall). It can be seen from many parts of Taipei, and its southeastern slope can be seen from Nangang Beach. The mountain is the namesake of the Formosa Plover, an Asian species of bird. The peak is also home to many animals, such as Sunda flyingfox, which is endangered, and Formosan hawk mouse. Due to its proximity to major cities, the mountain is often the subject of photoshoots and television broadcasts. It is also a popular location for school outings. The mountain is accessible by trail, starting from Yilan Trail Master Yiliang Lu's residence. The trail begins by heading southeast from the peak's southeastern slope and traversing across Chunghu Post, a lighthouse in Beitou, and down into Yanchung County. The entire distance of the trail is 2,495km. The trail is divided into 17 stages with the last stage starting from Chiayi County and ending in Taichung. The peak is ringed by a trail which allows for a somewhat easy ascent without special equipment. The mountain's weather conditions can be unpredictable, and, at an elevation of 1,767m, there are often storms. There is an elementary school on the peak which has been in operation since the 1970s. The campus is open to public viewing and the buildings on campus are also available for short term rental. In January 2017, an online voting program was introduced by the FormosaPeak.com website to solicit suggestions for new names for the mountain. On February 22, 2017, the Formosa Plover was chosen as the winning name by the \"million\" vote, narrowly beating out two other finalists, Liaohtsa Spire and Yalu Cliff. Starting on March 10, 2017, the Formosa Plover name was implemented with the unveiling of the \"New Formosa Plover Long-distance hiking course\". A stage of the trail passes by the peak, with the first stage beginning in Yilan County and ending in Beitou. Trail 17 in the Taiwan Trail was officially launched on May 20, 2017, on the southern slope of Formosa Peak. The peak is located within Formosa Plover Nature Reserve, established in 1983. The peak and the surrounding areas have been designated as a Habitat Conservation Area. The peak is also the site of a radio communications tower for many forms of public service in Taiwan. As the trail passes by the peak, there are many vantage points from which the peak and surrounding areas may be viewed. There are also multiple viewpoints on the trail itself. The peak is located between Yilan City and Beitou. To access the peak, take Provincial Highway 9 to Yilan County, then take National Highway 9 to Beitou.

    "166 Rhodope is a semiautomatic pistol produced in the Czech Republic and based on the Karabini pistol design. It is chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum Luger pistol cartridge and has a 17-round box magazine. The Rhodope is made in three versions, all of which have the same basic design, but differ in the choice of finishes and equipment. The Rhodope I and Rhodope II are similar in appearance, differing primarily in the choice of wood for the wooden stocks and the Rhodope II having a magazine disconnect. The Rhodope III is less ornately constructed, with a polyamide stock and a laser sight. All three models have a manual safety, a decocker mechanism, and a single slide locked back, double-action only mode of operation. The Rhodope was offered with a white wooden or black polyamide stock, with a red, black or green palm rest, and with a bright or dark silver finishing. The Rhodope was introduced in 2017 and was originally available only to qualified Czech police and security forces, but it was made available to non-police customers in March 2019. As of April 2019, 7,500 such pistols had been sold, at a price of 12,000 Czech korunas (about €675). While the basic design of the Rhodope is that of the Karabini, it differs in some details from that pistol. Most notably, it is wider, shorter and heavier, while having a larger grip and an extended safety catch. While the barrel of the Rhodope is chrome-lined like that of most Luger variants, it has a standard length of 8.8 cm, as opposed to the 10.2 cm used by most Luger variants. The Rhodope also has a modified operating system, using a single hand-detachable magazine rather than a double-stacked magazine. This magazine is narrower, shorter and thicker than that of most handguns, making it incompatible with most double-stack magazines. The rear sight is a fixed blade, while the Rhodope has an adjustable rear sight, and the frame is slightly modified to accept different ring sizes for the Luger barrel. The Rhodope was awarded the \"Best Czech Pistol of the Year\" award in 2019, and the Rhodope I with black stock and green laser was also awarded \"Best Pistol of the Year\" at the 2019 Czech Army handgun competition. In March 2020, Blokexport, the state-owned Czech manufacturer of arms and military equipment, ceased production of the Rhodope. Blokexport had not been paid by Rhodia, the French company that had purchased the Czech license to produce the pistol, for some time, and was in debt for the direct costs of production. Blokexport is seeking to sell the equipment and molds used to produce the Rhodope. The Czech police have announced that they will no longer be using the Rhodope, and that they are searching for a new supplier. The search for a new supplier was successful by April 2020, and the Czech Police started to use the new pistols for patrolling. Due to the risk of unavailability of the license holders, the Rhodope is not listed in the important international gun calibers and magazines. The most recent model of the Rhodope, the Rhodope II, has gained some popularity because of its distinguishing features: a magazine disconnect and a decocker mechanism. All three Rhodope models are now manufactured by a new company in the Czech Republic, based in Karlovy Vary. The Rhodope is covered by a Czech 4-year warranty. While the basic design of the Rhodope is that of the Karabini, it differs in some details from that pistol.

By Anurag Bhardwaj IANS Sanjay Shukla works as a polio worker in Indore, India. He and his team administer polio drops to children to protect them from a crippling disease. There are about 125,000 children under five in Indore. Shukla and his colleagues have to administer about 5,000 doses of polio drops each day. Every day, they administer about 125,000 doses of polio drops. They have to do this for about 18 months. They earn about 80,000 Indian rupees per month (about US$1,360). That is less than 1,000 Indian rupees per day. Shukla is paid hazard pay for working with a hazardous substance, which is called polio vaccine. Every year, about 0.3 percent of people who receive the polio drops develop a fever and have a mild to serious reaction to the vaccine. The injection-related injuries reported globally from 2010 to 2015 involved a total of 6,551 muscle injuries, 160 neural injuries, 29 tendon injuries, five artery injuries and 34 cases of cardiac injury. These injuries led to two deaths. \"It is hazardous work, but if I do not do this work, there will be at least one more child who will suffer from polio and will not be able to walk,\" says Shukla. Shukla and his colleagues have to inject the vaccine into the children's arms. The children could use their hands to try and protect themselves while the polio workers were giving them the vaccine. Sometimes, children will put their hands over their mouths, and the polio workers have to remove the hands before giving the vaccine. Injecting a child with polio vaccine is a challenging task.

    "Coffins on Io - Io is the largest and most geologically active moon of Jupiter. In many regards it could be considered a small planet in its own right, due to its similar size and gravitational forces to our own world. Despite this, Io has only been permanently mapped since 1979, due to its challenging environment. Io is composed of a silicate mantle and a volcanic surface, with a global iron core. Io's fast rotation means that all of the crust is younger than 100 million years. Volcanically, Io is wholly smooth except for a few polar volcanic calderas, plus thousands of smaller shield volcanoes and dome-shaped mountains. Due to its geological activity, Io has a dynamic rotational axis. This rotational axis is not fixed in space, but is continuously shifting. This causes Io's surface to vary in orientation from extremely deformed in places (such as the volcano 'Acidalia Planitia'), to nearly featureless in others (such as the equally volcanic region of Pallene). Io's surface is barren, but water oceans sit just beneath the surface in many places. These water oceans are key to Io's current geology, as the continual vaporization of ice creates a measurable torque, changing Io's orientation in its orbit around Jupiter. Io is known to haveHadley-Jupiters, twin moons that are each similar in mass to Earth's Moon. Io is the only body in the solar system known to have Hadley-Jupiter system.",

I try to get the user that is logged in in this Middleware but i always get AnonymousUser. Here is my code : from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin from django.http import HttpResponse from.forms import UserForm class MyAuthMiddleware(LoginRequiredMixin, MiddlewareMixin, object): def process_request(self, request): if request.user.is_authenticated(): print(\"Not anonymous : \", request.user) else: print(\"Anonymous\") I also try to get the request in the view, it works. But in my middleware it doesn't work. Here is my view : def a_view(request): request.user Thank you for your help. A: Middleware is run before views, so request is not yet available in your middleware. However, you could use an Observer to register a callback with the request whenever it is created. from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, Observer from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin from django.http import HttpResponse from django.utils.functional import lazy class MyAuthMiddleware(LoginRequiredMixin, MiddlewareMixin, Observer): def __init__(self): self.request_seen = False self.request = lazy.WeakResource() self.request.user = None def process_request(self, request): if not self.request_seen: self.request_seen = True self.request = request if request.user.is_authenticated(): print(\"Not anonymous : \", request.user) else: print(\"Anonymous\") def get_request(self): \"\"\" Returns the `request` passed to the `process_request()` method. \"\"\" return self.request request =property(fget=get_request) You can then use this in a view like this: def a_view(request): print(request.my_auth_middleware.get_request()) A: You can also try below approach. It's based on @Rahul Gupta's answer but uses \"context\" directly from the request instead of request.request. from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, Observer from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin from django.http import HttpResponse from django.utils.functional import lazy class MyAuthMiddleware(LoginRequiredMixin, MiddlewareMixin, Observer): def __init__(self, request): self.request = request self.user = None def process_request(self, request): if not self.request.user.is_authenticated(): print(\"Not anonymous : \", self.request.user) self.user = request.user else: print(\"Anonymous\") request =property(fget=get_request) def get_request(self): return self.request user =property(fget=get_user) You can use it like: def a_view(request): print(request.my_auth_middleware.user) <|endoftext|># -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # Copyright (c) 2019 Satpy Developers # All rights reserved. # # Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without # modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: # # * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, # this list of conditions and the following disclaimer. # # * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, # this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation # and/or other materials provided with the distribution. # # * Neither the name",

    "Madness Under the Royal Palms is a beachfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, that was the winter home of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor, from 1939 until his death in 1945. During this period, the estate was swarmed by famous people, many of whom were captured on film by photographic studio setting up camp on the lawn. In addition to the Roosevelts, the site was visited by Churchill, FDR's successor as president, as well as numerous other heads of state and their families, as well as political figures and celebrities. The property was purchased in 1939 for $825,000, the highest price ever paid at the time for any property in Palm Beach. With its 6 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, the mansion was significantly more spacious than the official Presidental Residence at the time, the Florida White House, located across the street. Due to its proximity to the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the property was popular for hosting large scale yachting events. In 1940, a 150-foot long, 20 foot wide section of the docks belonging to the estate was torn down to make room for one of FDR's yachts, the USS Indianapolis, which was visiting the estate at the time. Roosevelt frequently entertained with large parties, often including an open bar, and a pièce de resistance was the annual New Year's Eve party which included a live band and dancing on the lawn to the sounds of Count Basie and his orchestra. The accommodations for such large numbers of guests required extensive planning, which was the domain of butler James 'Jimmy' Florian, whom the Roosevelts trusted with their personal business as well as the running of the estate. During World War II, the estate was the site of extensive secret government work, including a crash mapping and photo reconnaissance project carried out by P-39 Airacobra fighters of the 27th Pursuit Squadron between July and September 1943. As a result of the work done at the estate, the U.S. Army Air Corps selected Palm Beach County as the location for the permanent headquarters of the XXII Bomber Command, later changed to the 345th Bomb Group and 93d Bomb Squadron. After Roosevelt's death in 1945, the estate was inherited by his daughter, Anna Roosevelt González, who sold it in 1948 for $1.15 million, about one third its original cost. The home remained a private residence until 2009, when it was listed for sale for $100 million. After two years of negotiations, Dimitrios H. Panos and his partner Perry Distler purchased the estate for $29.95 million in 2012. After extensive renovations, the estate was opened to the public as a tourist destination in 2015.",

    "The Epic of American Civilization is a 23-volume historical novel written between 1854 and 1887 by Welsh American historian and poet James Bradley. The work chronicles the formative events of American history from the perspective of an American farmer, described by scholars as tending \"towardde Sweaptessman depiction of an evil, exploitativeEuropean colonizer.\" The series was highly praised upon its release but has subsequently been criticized for promoting an \"American Exceptionalism\" viewpoint. Bradley worked on the first volume, which covers the period from the landing of the English colonists in America to the American Revolution, from 1854 to 1857. Volume two, covering the period from the American Revolution to the Founding of the United States, was finished by his son, also named James Bradley, from 1887 to 1893. The remaining 17 volumes were completed by other scholars after Bradley's death in 1899. The final volume, covering the period from the Founding of the United States to 1854, was published in 2007. Since Bradley's death, scholars have cast doubt on his historiographical objectivity and have questioned whether he intended to provide an impartial account of American history, instead drawing from the biases of his time and presenting a portrait of the United States as a proto-racist nation. The Epic has been cited as an influence on the creation of the US Department of Education's National History Standards.

Scholars also criticize the presentation of the Founding Fathers as \"aristocratic and not fully engaged in the struggle for American independence\".

Founded in the 17th century, the cemetery is located on the slope of a mountain and was designed by the Artux Kingdom of Mongolia. Covering an area of 2.5 square kilometers, it is the biggest ancient cemetery of the New World. It contains thousands of tombs of the also Mongol-Chinese Artux royalty and is considered a magnificent example of classical architecture and landscaping. By the end of the 20th century, the cemetery was in a very bad state of preservation. A project to conserve it, carried out by an Italian team from the University of Bologna, was supported by the city of Beijing and was officially launched in 2007. Restoration works were conducted between 2008 and 2017 and, as of 2021, the cemetery is again open to visitors. The Cemetery of Confucius is located about 90 km south of the provincial capital Xining. It is accessible by road and regular minibuses run from Xining. In 2017, the Cemetery of Confucius was added to the World Heritage List under the name \"Cemeteries of the Artux Kings\". Due to the importance of the Artux Kingdom in the history of Central Asia, it was featured in Netflix's 2019 documentary series Vikings, called \"Vikings in China\".

    "Richard DeLong (born 1942) is a computer scientist known for his work on languages that parallel everyday human languages, such as English. DeLong began his academic career as an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, where he helped to create the FIRST circuit design competition in high school. DeLong received his BA in mathematics and physics from Harvard University in 1964, and his PhD in linguistics from Stanford University in 1968 under the supervision of Noam Chomsky. After graduation, DeLong did his post-doctoral work with Kenneth Walbird at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1971, DeLong became an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, where he remained for 12 years. In 1983, DeLong returned to the University of California, Berkeley, where he is now a professor of computer science and a member of the Molecular Computer Science and Engineering and Language Production teams. DeLong was elected a fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 1986 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. His 1989 book, The Minimalist Program, has been called \"one of the most influential papers in the history of NLP\". In 1991, DeLong and Peter Sellis published the first joint paper on what would later become called dependency parsing, an approach to analyzing a sentence that computes its syntactic structure.

    "Eytan Stibbe (Hebrew: ayton Stephan) (born 1953) is an Israeli historian of Jewish mysticism and co-director of the Shazar Institute in Jerusalem. Stibbe has published a number of books on the history of the Jewish mystic movement, its origins, doctrines and famous disciples and has written articles for many academic journals. His book, Eliyahu and Isaac: ancient metaphysics and the origins of Judaism's godly sacrifice, has been described by critics as \"provid[ing] the first serious challenge to the conventional view that the origins of Judaism's God worship can be dated back to the eighth century BCE.\" In a review of Stibbe's book, The Mystical God, the theologian Jonathan Klawans wrote: \"Written in a clear and elegant style, the book gracefully handles the thorny issues of late antique Judaism, including the significance of the Temple to early Christianity, the development of the Philo-Semitism controversy and the origins of Jesus and his predecessors. It will be of great interest not only to those familiar with the history of Judaism and early Christianity, but also to scholars of medieval Jewish mysticism and mysticism in the modern period.\" Stibbe's other works on mysticism include Meditations with Asketene (2010), which has been described as \"a landmark in the exploration of Jewish gnosis during the early medieval period\" and his 2014 co-authored book, The Secret Torah: reading the book of Psalms through the eyes of the mystics, which was described by Hadar Hurvitz as \"a landmark in bringing into focus the tradition of interpreting the Book of Psalms through a mystical lens\" His book, Eliyahu and Isaac: ancient metaphysics and the origins of Judaism's godly sacrifice, has been described by critics as \"provid[ing] the first serious challenge to the conventional view that the origins of Judaism's God worship can be dated back to the eighth century BCE.\" In a review of Stibbe's book, The Mystical God, the theologian Jonathan Klawans wrote: \"Written in a clear and elegant style, the book gracefully handles the thorny issues of late antique Judaism, including the significance of the Temple to early Christianity, the development of the Philo-Semitism controversy and the origins of Jesus and his predecessors.

    "The 2008 riot in Mongolia began on the night of January 2, 2008, when a large crowd of Bayanzurkh residents attacked a police station. The riot quickly spread to nearby towns and cities, and by the next day, at least 17 shops and two apartment blocks had been destroyed, and more than 50 people had been arrested. The cause of the rioting is unknown, though a report in the Chinese-language daily newspaper Bayan under the headline \"Robbers attack cars, cause chaos\" blamed the unrest on \"car thefts and robberies\". The riots followed a pattern typical of riots in Mongolia – mob violence and property damage quickly escalated out of control, and police attempts to subdue the crowd with tear gas and water cannons merely served to inflame the situation. The riots continued for four consecutive days, by which time at least 500 people had been injured and about 60 businesses, including those in Bayanzurkh, had been destroyed. After the riots, the parliament criticized the police for being ineffective and using excessive force, and promised to investigate the causes of the unrest. At least three people were killed, and damage to property and infrastructure was estimated to be in the range of 200–250 million USD. At least 17 people were arrested, five of whom were charged with murder, and a further investigation was announced into the causes of the unrest. The 2008 riot in Mongolia was the first major public outbreak of civil unrest in Mongolia since the restoration of democracy in 1990. ... The riots were followed by a large nationwide demonstration on January 12, 2008, when an estimated 200,000 Mongolians participated in nationwide protests against the government. The demonstrations were led by political parties and journalists, and accused the government of failing to provide adequate housing, public services, and employment. In response to the demonstrations, the government announced a range of social and economic reforms, including the expansion of free education and health care, the abolition of some road tolls, the provision of cash payments to those affected by the riot, and the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of old buildings.",
    "Charles Perceval, 7th Earl of Egmont, was British statesman who served as Under-Secretary for the Home Department between 1807 and 1809 and Paymaster-General between 1809 and 1828. Thoughts on the article's creation I would consider writing an article on Charles Perceval, 7th Earl of Egmont, not only is this man was Paymaster-General between 1809 and 1828 but he also served as Under-Secretary for the Home Department between 1807 and 1809. This two offices made him a crucial member of William Pitt the Younger's administration. While in office he was concerned about the Catholic Question. During this time, the Catholic Emancipation was not a popular policy amongst the general public. The Catholic Church was seen as being corrupt and holding too much power, so political parties did not take either side of the issue. Charles Perceval felt that the King should have granted Catholics the right to vote during this time. He was posthumously framed for the murder of Daniel O'Connell and ultimately died as a result of this. I think it's good to mention that this man was Paymaster-General and Under-Secretary for the Home Department as he was instrumental in the passing of some key legislation during his time in office. I would also like to add that he was also involved in the murder of Daniel O'Connell. Historical context This man was a politician who played a key role in the Catholic Question and the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act. WRITING PERFECTION This is a good starting point for the creation of this article, however I would like to suggest some edits. Firstly I would like to suggest editing this text into the article as I feel it is important to the History of England. \"Charles Perceval, 7th Earl of Egmont, was British statesman who served as Under-Secretary for the Home Department between 1807 and 1809 and Paymaster-General between 1809 and 1828.\"",
    "The Migrants Rights Network is a British charity that campaigns for the rights of migrants. It was established in 2001 and has over 5000 member organizations in 60 countries. Its current chief executive is Jonathan Allen, who took up the position in 2019. Its headquarters are in London. The MRN has three main goals. First, to promote awareness of migrants' human rights in Europe and worldwide. Second, to engage with European institutions, the EUREP committee, MEPs and other European agencies on migrants' rights issues. Third, to put forward practical solutions to migrant's rights issues, for example by helping migrants to claim benefits or helping them to access legal aid. The Migrants Rights Network is best known for its periodic Human Rights Visits to Europe (known as \"Siegesers\") which bring together migrant and asylum-seeker groups from across Europe to meet with MEPs, officials, and journalists. The Migrants' Rights Network has published several reports on migrants' rights, including \"EU Migrants in the UK: Human Rights Watch Report 2009\" and \"Migrant Streamlining: UK Migrants' Experience of Unemployment and Benefits\". Migrants Rights Network has formed alliances with other NGOs and UN agencies to promote migrants' rights, for example with the Human Rights Watch, the European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights and the International Labour Organization. The MRN is active in promoting migrants' rights in Europe, and recently achieved some positive changes. In February 2020, it helped win parliamentary approval for the \"European Mine Action Service\" to provide humanitarian mine awareness training to migrants. Despite the good work the MRN does, its work on migrants' rights is often misrepresented, particularly by right-wing media. In December 2019, the British Home Office tried to revoke the MRN's registration as a charity, claiming it had failed to disclose some donations. In response, over 2000 members of the charity signed a petition asking the court to reject the Home Office's claims and to restore the charity's registration instead.",

    "In 2010, I was struggling with personal and professional issues. I had lost all motivation and hope. All I could see were obstacles in my way and I did not know how I would ever achieve my goals. I felt stuck and unable to move forward. I felt like I was on a fast track to burn out and regret my life choices. I had lost all sense of joy and passion. Then one day, as I was browsing the web, I came across a thread about Starbucks Refreshers. It mentioned that this drink could help boost your energy levels and also help you focus for up to four hours. This idea sounded too good to be true, so I had to try it. I bought a refresher and to my amazement, it was exactly as they described. The caffeine and sugar levels in the drink helped me focus and it really did work as described. That was the moment that I decided that I had to get out of my rut and change my life for the better. Since then, I have found my passion in my career and have found the balance in life that I was searching for. This story is not unique. Many, many people around the world have experienced the exact same benefits that I have. Please do not allow the difficulties of life to stop you from pursuing your dreams. Only you can decide your destiny. Thank you Starbucks for giving me the push and encouragement that I needed to change my life for the better.",

However, it is not yet known if these studies used linear alkylbenzenes in the laboratory, or if they are also relevant to other chemicals. particular matter of note is the instability of linear alkylbenzenes in the environment. Their molecular structure makes them very susceptible to oxidation, especially in the presence of light. This rapid oxidation causes the molecules to break up into shorter-chain chemicals. This reaction is commonly referred to as \"oxidative termination\". The primary oxidation products of linear alkylbenzenes are four monomethylbenzenes.

    "Phanaroea is a genus of flies in the family Sciomyzidae, found in Palaearctic Asia. Species in this genus are smaller than those of genera in the tribe Sciomyzini, and are characterized by the long posterior horn of the male cerci, which is extended in various directions, often sharply directed forwards. The genus was created to accommodate these flies, and to place them within the Sciomyzini, although some authors maintain that it should be moved into its own family. Some species are Batesian mimics of harmless species, such as aphids and ladybirds. Others are parasitoids of oligochaetes. Some species, especially those in the Eurasian subspecies, are used as maggots in meat and poultry production, despite the pain this causes the animals. Phanaroea blanchardi has been implicated in the recent collapse of a Scottish rabbit breeding operation due to a disease in its herd of rabbits, and Phanaroea annularis was found to be the most likely cause of sudden death in farmed deer in England. The potential for these flies to harm humans and animals makes them regulated by many governments as a biosecurity threat. The severe Warrick Hill disease, an algal disease of trout, was connected in 2018 to P. annularis. Phanaroea can be used as a biological control of insect pests. For example, it has been used successfully to control corn rootworm and the fall armyworm. The name Phanaroea is a combination of the Greek for \"insect\" (phage) and \"Sciomyzidae\", the family to which the species assigned to this genus belong.",

    "Acacia phasmoides, also known as the giant bloodwood or giant nail tree, is a tree of the genus Acacia and the pod-forming species of the West Australian cajun woodlands. The tree is unusual in being largely phasmatous, having brilliant silvery grey bark mostly on the thinnest branches, and huge branchlets which may grow to over 20 m in length. The tree is commonly found in saline areas between Perth and Shark Bay in Western Australia where it is found on quite unusual soil types - on floodable river deposits and the occasional small hilltop between extensive wetlands. The tree is named the West Australian Floral Conservation Authority's (WAFCA) Rare and Threatened species of Conservation Significance. The thorny tree is very slow growing and is quite rare in cultivation, although grows readily from cuttings and is an exaserbating tree which will form massive shade. There is one particular population of A. phasmoides at Merredin, in the Yilgarn Craton, which has its own population status listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, due to concerns about ground water levels. This tree species is of great interest to scientists because of its ability to adapt to the effects of extended dry periods when many other plants in the area would succumb. The WAFCA have undertaken a 2-3 year project funded by the Australia Council for the Environment, whereby monitoring is being undertaken of soil and ground water levels in the area where the tree is found. Results from this project are due at the end of 2021 but initial results indicate the ground water levels have been very high even during the recent droughts.",

    "Sexto Sentido (Portuguese for \"Sixth sense\") is the second studio album by Brazilian entertainer Xuxa. It was released in 1991, two years after her first studio album, Malinawa. The album became one of the best-selling and best-reviewed in her career, having been acclaimed for its success in crossing linguistic and cultural barriers and for being faithful to her own sense of humor, managing to reach several audiences beyond Brazil's borders. The album's title refers to Xuxa's newly found sixth sense, which allows her to understand what others are feeling even when they aren't openly saying or showing it. Although the concept of the album was initially inspired by American television show The Six Million Dollar Man, the theme was deeply revised and several episodes from that show were deemed unsuitable for children. Sexto Sentido became the biggest crossover album in the history of Brazilian popular music, being the first album to sell more than a million copies and receiving generally positive reviews from the international press, although not all of them were convinced about its contents. It has been cited as an influence to the development of the Latin hip hop scene and has been included in several \"greatest crossover albums\" lists. Sexto Sentido was launched in several countries in South America, Europe and Oceania, becoming the biggest-selling album in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela and Portugal. In Portugal it was even certified with 6× platinum, being the best-selling album in that country since 2002, according to the Associação Independente de Edição e Distribuição de Artistas (AIEDA).",

    "Death Magnetic is a 2005 album by the American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on October 9, 2005, by Nielsen/Heavy Metal Records. The album's title is a tribute to the 1979 album Death Magnetic by fortune cookie, and is a play on the words \"death\"—used in its original literal sense—and \"magnet\", a band member's nickname. Death Magnetic was recorded at the band's own Studio X in Wacken, Germany, and was produced by Mike Elizondo. The album was leaked to the internet four days prior to its official release, and upon its release was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Some were positive, complimenting the band's sound, musicianship, and creative freedom, while others were more mixed, finding the album's subject matter (at the time) controversial and poorly executed. The critical backlash had a negative impact on Metallica's music sales, though it was a success on the album charts, going platinum in the band's native America and becoming their first number one in over fifteen years. Three singles were released from the album. The first, \"My Apocalypse\", was originally intended for 2004's St. Anger, but was removed from the final product due to its lack of radio airplay. \"Walk\" and \"DOLOR CHE PALPA\" were released as second singles; both of which failed to enter the top 100 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the former peaked at number 20 on the Mainstream Rock chart. Death Magnetic was followed by a world tour in support of the album. The band went on to record a live album and a documentary, Death Magnetic film, in support of the album.",

    "Robert Peter Gale (formerly known as Robin Peter Joseph Charles Gale) is a fictional character from the Back to the Future movies, and a spin-off series of Back to the Future starring Michael J. Fox. In the movies he is portrayed by Christopher Lloyd. Gale is a time traveler from 1985 who meets young psychiatrist Jennifer Parker, and they fall in love. The spin-off series, which also includes a television movie, revolves around the pair attempting to overcome the consequences of their actions and their eventual fate. Gale is a wealthy smart-ass who regularly breaks the rules and has a talent for getting into trouble. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly meets Gale at the moment his time travel device activates, and they both set off to visit their respective futures. Gale's future is 1985, and he meets Jennifer Parker, a Marty McFly-like character who appears to be his equivalent. Jennifer is trying to stop Gale's older self from making a critical mistake that would cause the space-time continuum to collide in 1985, thereby changing the past and allowing a time-traveling flux capacitor to become available to all. Marty must travel back in time to give himself to teenage self, thereby affecting only his own future, and allowing him to change the past without changing anything else. Back to the Future plays with time travel concepts and is not an accurate depiction of time travel. In fact, the Back to the Future films acknowledge this in an end tag where the characters observe that \"time travel is not possible\". Nevertheless, Gale is revealed at the end of the first movie to have traveled in time in an attempt to stop himself from making a mistake in the past, and is alone in 1985 except for a woman named Clara Clayton, who turns out to be his future self. Gale's destiny following his interference in the past is a major plot element in the sequels Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III, as well as the Back to the Future television series, where Gale is portrayed by Scott Lawrence. Gale is not explicitly identified as a time traveler in any of the Back to the Future media except for a sequence in Back to the Future Part II in which Jennifer asks him how he managed to change so many events in the past, to which he replies that he does not know. The Back to the Future character appeared as a toy in the 1980s, and his personality and character traits were described in the book Back to the Future: The Definitive Story of the Toys. The Back to the Future movies were a commercial success, leading to a spin-off series. Gale also appeared as a minor character in the television show spin-off trilogy and in the Back to the Future: The Ride.",

    "Nintendo 64 accessories include the N64 Controller, AC adaptor, Nintendo 64 Camera, Nintendo 64 wall mount, and a Nintendo 64 mouse. Mercury Interactive, a division of Smartron, released the Nintendo 64 web browser. In 1999, Nintendo created the Virtual Console service, which allows users to download games for their Nintendo 64 systems that were originally released for other consoles. The service uses white-label streaming servers provided by Warner, which tap into their RTV copyright management system.[30] In 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed against Nintendo claiming that the company used third party heaters to correct the battery performance of the Nintendo 64 battery, resulting in users over-heating their consoles. The heaters, the lawsuit claims, were sold by third parties without the authorization of Nintendo, and users overheated their consoles as a result. Nintendo denied the allegations of the lawsuit. In March 2023, Nintendo announced that it would no longer produce or ship new Nintendo 64 console in order to focus on preserving the remaining stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems. In December 2023, a group of channel partners organized under the name \"Nintendo N64 Channel\" was formed with the intention of preserving remaining stock of the Nintendo 64 console and supporting third-party developers releasing games for the Nintendo 64. Nintendo officially discontinued the Nintendo 64 on December 2023. In 2024, Nintendo created the Nintendo 64 UK brand to re-market the console for gaming events and commemorations. In 2026, the N64 Camera was made available for sale on the Nintendo Swap Shop for the first time. Starting in 2028, the N64 camera requires an internet connection to connect to Nintendo Swap Shop to function. The online subscription for the Nintendo 64 camera costs $5/month or $50/year. The Nintendo 64 console was added to the open source Perkeep archive in 2028, alongside other esoteric systems like the Atari 2600 and Intellivision. Despite discontinuing production of new Nintendo 64 consoles, Nintendo still receives revenue from existing stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems being sold through Nintendo N64 Channel, Nintendo Swap Shop, and third-party retailers such as Amazon. In 2029, the Nintendo 64 mouse was made available for purchase on the Nintendo Swap Shop for the first time. By 2030, almost all remaining stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems was accounted for, with the Nintendo N64 Channel the only active channel for purchases. In 2031, Nintendo's ownership of the N64 trademark expired after having failed to renew it. In 2033, the Nintendo 64 Camera requires an internet connection to connect to Nintendo Swap Shop to function. In 2033, Mercury Interactive, the company behind the Nintendo 64 web browser, was acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment, the parent company of Warner Music Group. By 2034, Nintendo had sold all remaining stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems, and all digital Nintendo 64 games were made available for purchase on the Nintendo Swap Shop for the first time. In 2035, the Nintendo N64 Channel was rebranded as \"Nintendo 64.com\", as part of a broader rebranding of Nintendo's platforms and services to reflect the brand's more forward-facing, youth-focused image, as part of a corporate initiative known as \"ID@XCOM\". By 2038, the Nintendo 64 Camera no longer required an internet connection to connect to Nintendo Swap Shop to function. Between 2038 and 2039, all digital games for Nintendo 64 were moved from the Nintendo Swap Shop to Nintendo's cloud storage, with online play relying on an internet connection until 2039. In 2039, all online Nintendo 64 services shut down, with no way for owners to access their games, licenses, or save files. In 2039, the Nintendo 64 console was removed from Nintendo's product list, and all existing stock was sold through Nintendo N64 Channel and third-party retailers for $0.01-$1, with no ongoing maintenance fees. In 2039, almost all remaining stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems had been accounted for. In 2040, almost all remaining stock of Nintendo 64 games and systems had been accounted for, with all game licenses and save files for those games also removed from the consoles.

    "The Housing Action Trust (HAT) is a housing association. Its headquarters are in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. It owns and manages around 20,000 homes, most of which are rented out. The HAT was formed in 1965 as the first housing association in the United Kingdom. It was originally called the Council for the Encouragement of Music and Arts (CEMA). The name was changed to the Housing Action Trust in 1991. The trust provides permanent housing for people who are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and who are struggling with benefit payments and/or debt. They can stay in the home for a limited time or as long-term tenants, although they are usually only allowed to stay there if they are actively looking for work. The trust looks for rental properties in areas of high employment where rent levels are below the market rate. They are generally occupied by families with children. The trust has a multi-site management policy which means that all properties are rented out across a network of several management sites. They have several sites in London, Brighton and Hove, and Hertfordshire. The largest site has over 400 homes and costs between £30,000 and £50,000 per property per year to manage. The trust manages around 20,000 homes and is ranked as the 59th largest housing association in the United Kingdom. As of March 2022 the trust had an annual revenue of £102 million, an expenditure of £102 million and a profit of £0 million. The trust's accounts showed a small profit mainly due to the value of land used for its homes which is added to the associated sites. The trust is under severe financial pressure due to low house prices and must make massive cuts to its portfolio. This has led to protests from residents who are concerned that their properties will be sold at a discount or be left empty. As of March 2022 the trust had 1,308 housing complaints, an eightfold increase on 2018. The trust responded that it will only take action in the most extreme circumstances and that \"most of the issues were easily resolved\". They have proposed building an extra 20 properties per month, up from their current rate of 14 per month, in order to try and reduce the number of complaints. They have also announced they will be building a new preschool, providing a GP surgery and Surestart centre as part of a large redevelopment at a site in London. The trust has also been criticised for being dissolved and its assets sold to a larger housing association, Cala Homes. Critics claim that Cala Homes is being pressured to sell its existing stock to meet demand and that this means that the social housing shortage will continue. They also say that the new trust will have similar policies to the original and so social housing properties will be left empty. On June 12th 2022, members of the public signed a petition with over 17,000 signatures, calling on the government to step in and cancel the sale. Labour leadership contender Sir CMP Crouch became the first major party politician to call for an investigation, claiming that the public were not being told the full story. He claimed that the deal may have been rushed through without the need for the go-ahead from regulators and that full transparency was not being provided. A few days later, Shadow Chancellor Chris Leslie also stated that he would have blocked the deal, had he been in the position to do so. On July 22nd 2022, the Office of Fair Trading announced it would investigate. It was initially reported that the OFT were looking into whether there had been any abuse of a legally secure transactions (LAST) regime, but on August 6th 2022, the OFT confirmed that they were in fact investigating the whole process. On December 2022, the OFT announced it would not be imposing any action against Cala Homes. Critics claim this is not enough and further investigation is needed to ensure no wrongdoing occurred. On January 15th 2023, the Chair of the House of Commons Treasury Committee, Meg Hillier, announced that the Committee would hold an inquiry into the collapse of the Housing Action Trust, bringing the total number of investigations into the affair to six. On March 6th 2023, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) announced that they will be investigating the Hertfordshire Constabulary for evidence of potential criminal misconduct in the case of the Housing Action Trust. The investigation will focus on \"the appropriateness of decisions taken by the Hertfordshire Constabulary at the end of the Housing Action Trust's lease of a police station... and in advance of the disposal of Housing Association property\".",

    "Shabsi Yogel (Hebrew: שחסי יגל) is the Arabic name of a type of dumpling popular in Israel. It is made of flour, oil, milk and starch and is wrapped in bacon or caul fat. It has been argued that the origin of the shabsiyya (פרות) is the Indian Parantaka, though some experts claim that its real origin is the Middle Eastern kitchen of the North Africa Arabs and could have been brought to Israel by the waves of Jewish refugees from Arab countries after the creation of the State of Israel. Shabsi Yogel is part of the traditional Israeli cuisine, and is often served for Sabbath lunch. It is traditional to serve Shabsi Yogel with sauce choron (chopped onion, green pepper and tomato). The dumplings are usually made in large quantities and then frozen. They can also be baked. Here is a shabsiyya recipe.

    "John the bookmaker controversy was a dispute in the UK Parliament in the late 1990s and early 2000s involving a Labour MP, John Mann, who was under investigation for accepting bribes in the form of cash and property from a shadowy businessman named Charles constantine. John Mann approached the bookmaker, John who worked in Soho, London and asked him to donate to the Labour party. John promised to raise questions about constantine with the government if the donation was large enough. The bookmaker agreed and gave John a tape recording of the conversation. John passed the tape recording on to the police who opened an investigation into John Mann. Mann made several unsuccessful attempts to have the case against him dismissed. At one point, he offered to pay the bookmaker £150,000 for his evidence, but the bookmaker continued to refuse to testify. Eventually, the case was thrown out of court due to a technicality and the bookmaker was found not guilty. However, the police privately held the bookmaker responsible for the fallout and he soon after went into receivership. Edited The bookmaker controversy, also known as the John the bookmaker scandal or the John the bookmaker affair, was a scandal that spread through the United Kingdom Parliament in the late 1990s and early 2000.

    "Parr, St Helens is a town in the English county of Lancashire. The town is situated on the A565 coast road between St.alyso and Chapel en le Frith. The population of this tiny settlement in the 20th century was less than 100. However, this has increased significantly due to new residential construction, which has been triggered by the closure of the adjacent RAF Benabi and the development of the site of the former RAF St. Athan for commercial and residential use. The area of the town is just over a square mile. Parr sits adjacent to the site of an old Roman marching station known as Bremetennacum Devani, and some archeological excavations have been conducted in the town. This is one of only two officially recognised modern day legions in England. The other is at Lepenski Vir in Magdalaud, Normandy, France. The town has a Church of England parish church, with the building dating from the 12th century with significant alterations and additions in the late 15th century and again in the 19th century. There is also a Catholic church, St. Francis of Assisi, built in 1951 and designed by Charles Doherty of the firm Hilditch and Doherty. The original village of Parr developed on a sloping barren hillside above the now disused Coast Road. The settlement expanded in the 18th century, with the building of several substantial mills powered by the River Mouth, which flows through the town. From the mid-19th century, the industry in the town declined, with the introduction of machines powered by steam and then by electricity. One of the most famous people to have come from Parr is Stanley Matthews, who grew up in the town and who still has a house there. Matthews was a Football League medal winner with St Helens Town in the 1920-21 season, when the club reached the final of the league, but were beaten 3-0 by Barnsley. Matthews went on to make over 400 appearances for St Helens Town and signed for Leeds United in 1934. The following year, he won the League and Cup winners medal as Leeds won the Football League First Division. He stayed with Leeds until his retirement in 1951, when he was awarded the club's golden goal trophy. Matthews then went on to manage the club and is still known as \"the god of shaggy hoops\" to Leeds fans.",

    "Clove Valley, New York is a small village in southern Montgomery County, New York, United States. It is located about 20 miles southwest of New York City and is located on State Route 17A, which is known as the Historic Tioughnioga Turnpike. The village is named after the Clove Creek, which flows through the village. The first record of human presence in the area now known as Clove Valley goes back to the late prehistoric period. The territory was populated by various tribes of Iroquois Native Americans. Later, the area was occupied by Dutch traders and their Swedish allies, both of whom built several forts in the area. In 1661, the area was incorporated as a town called Bulls Head. It was later renamed to Kingston in 1693, after the eponymous English city, and again to Clove in 1807. Finally, it was reverted to its original name of Bulls Head in 1824. The current village was founded in 1832. Plan of the chapel. The Our Lady of Mercy's Chapel, located on Bulls Head Road (New York State Route 17A) in the hamlet of Clove Valley, was built in 1899 on land donated by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

    "President Trump was elected in 2016 on a platform of fulfilling America's greatness through strength and patriotism. Since taking office his policies have largely maintained the course set by former President Obama. The American economy is robust and unemployment is at a 17 year low, despite numerous attempts by the media to portray a declining economy, Trump has been reluctant to use the power of the presidency to implement socialist policies that would hurt the economy and sought to eliminate the national debt under Obama's presidency. The American healthcare system is the strongest in the world, with record numbers of Americans covered under healthcare and lower premiums for senior citizens. The United States is the strongest military power in the world, maintaining military alliances and building new partnerships to ensure the safety and stability of a free world. This is not to say there are not problems in the country. Illegal immigration is at an all time high, many believe this is because Trump administration policies in El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala have made their countries uninhabitable and therefore a common destination for those fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, but the media and Democrats in Congress deny the claims. Despite growing Federal deficits, Trump has been willing to spend money on building the wall on the Southern border, providing healthcare to those who cannot afford it, and other initiatives to bring prosperity to the country. While the media and political opponents in both parties paint a false picture of the Trump presidency, the American people elected a businessman with a clear focus on putting America first. So far, Trump has done just that.",

In 1632, he was arrested and accused of conspiring against the Inquisition with Córdoba, a heretic. He was tortured in prison, but refused to convert, and was sentenced to death.

    "Clams casino is a type of casino gambling that can be done practically live at the docks of a body of water with shells that are considered casino-like, such as the sea or a lake. The game is most commonly played in Southern California and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it has been popular since the 1960s. The game is formally played with two players (a dealer and a pit boss), against a bank of players, most commonly six players. One hand is dealt to the bank, and the other hand is dealt to the players. The players and the bank must each put up one pre-determined amount (generally $1 or $5), or \"slop\" (the exact amount is not shown, but can be assumed based on the number of players and the amount of slop). The goal of the game is to have the highest hand combined with the slop. If two or more players have the same highest hand, the players draw straws to determine who wins the pot. The winning pot is split evenly among the winners. The person who wins the most money in a night (this can be determined by counting the money in the pot at the end) is the \"clammer\". The \"clammer\" names another player to be the pit boss, and the pit boss picks the two new players for the next hand. The pit boss is generally the most senior player, and the players picked are more recent additions to the group. Traditionally, the game is played with five decks of playing cards, though modern variants use computer-generated cards.",

    "The Middle Class Revolt is a term used to describe the political activism of the middle class on both sides of the Atlantic, primarily in support of far right and far left political parties, who they see as representing their concerns. Middle Class Revolt is a term coined by British academic Richard Florida. It gained popularity due to the 2016 US presidential election and the UK EU referendum. The economic anxiety of the middle classes is a reaction to the perceived lack of political representation and their frustration at not being able to afford to live the lifestyles they were sold by politicians. They are struggling to regain the financial stability they enjoyed prior to 2008. The Middle Class Revolt can be seen in many ways. UKIP received many votes from the middle classes. The success of Donald Trump in the USA presidential election was also led in part by the Middle Class revolt. Jeremy Corbyn's success in the recent UK EU referendum was also aided by the middle class voters. Although the results of both of these referenda sparked the revolt, the outcome was not the ultimate cause, the economic anxiety of the middle classes was already present. Academics have analysed the election results and concluded that, while economic anxiety did play a part, the decisive factor was the appeal of the controversial leaders to the core beliefs of the targeted voters. The revolt can also be seen in the growth of online communities such as /r/TheResistance and TikTok's @TIREDprof. These communities provide a platform for members to express their frustration at not being listened to by the elite and to give solutions they feel would improve the lives of the wider population. For example, the middle class is crying out for better health and education services and more living space. The revolt is unlikely to find a voice in political discourse as the mainstream parties both listen to and court the wealthy elite rather than the middle class. This disconnect has led to the breaking of the mould of traditional two-party system and the rise of new parties such as the Greens and Labour International, both of whom have identified the growing disenchantment of the middle classes as a key voting block. There is concern amongst academics that the increase in far right and far left parties is a temporary blip, the middle class are still struggling, they will respond to those who represent their concerns but disillusionment with the political process could lead to a longer-term disengagement, threatening the continued political representation of those parties. It is clear the Middle Class are revolting, their voice has been heard and they will remain a force to be reckoned with in UK and US Politics. Economically the revolt has been less successful. Inequality has continued to rise since 2008, wage stagnation has continued and only the wealthiest of the middle classes have enjoyed income growth. Overall, the Middle Class Revolt is a successful term for describing the political activism of the middle classes, who are expressing their discontent with the current political system. The concern of the long-term threat to the continued political representation of those parties who have been heard is an interesting perspective, which could develop with future elections. Overall the Middle Class Revolt is a successful term for describing the political activism of the middle classes, who are expressing their discontent with the current political system. The long-term threat of the disengagement of these parties is also an interesting perspective to consider. The Middle Class Revolt can also be viewed as a threat, as it challenges the current political system. For example, parties who are campaigning on a left-right political spectrum have done so for many years, but the Middle Class are now looking for a solution to their economic problems, and these new parties may lose votes to the more established parties unless they can address the concerns of the Middle Class. The Middle Class will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in UK and US Politics. Richard Florida, a Florida based writer and urban geographer who first coined the term \"Middle Class Revolt\", describes it as \"a sense that the political class doesn't represent everyday Americans in meaningful ways\". In general elections, the term \"Middle Class\" refers to people with an income of approximately $40,000-$80,000 per year for an individual or $80,000-$160,000 for a couple. However, this definition is not fixed and can change depending on the context. The notion of the \"Middle Class\" is very nebulous, there is no agreed definition for this term, as it is open to personal interpretation. However, the \"Middle Class\" is a large group, and their concerns will continue to be a focal point in UK and US Politics. The Middle Class have seen huge rises in their standards of living, through house ownership, easy access to education, healthcare and transportation. The worry is that these spectacular increases have l",
    "Ming Shilu (明十丢), is a Chinese idiom which literally translates as \"Ming Shares Ten Talents\", it is a reference to an event in the Story of Zhu Wen, a former prime minister of Ancient China. Zhu Wen used his talents to produce ten wooden sculptures, but was unable to sell them because they did not match the aesthetic preferences of the time.

The idiom is used in an Instagram post by BTS, who are famous for their music careers. The idiom is popular with young people in China and has been made into many painting and sculpture versions. It is used in one of China's largest online shopping platforms Lazada's T-shirt collection. It is often selected as a topic for \"Wish of the Month\" on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, which users can vote on to receive gifts from the platform's sponsors. The idiom is sometimes paraphrased as \"Success doesn't come easy, so you have to work hard for it\" (成功不容易，要努力), which is the Chinese version of the famous quote \"Hard work invariably pays off\" (劳作忘食). The idiom is frequently referenced in content created by Chinese Literature and Art critics, discussing themes of trying one's best to achieve success. It is also the name of a Chinese orchestra based in Shanghai, which is known for being the first orchestra to use \"Zhu Wen\" as a orchestra name, in reference to the idiom.

    "Sahibzada Muhammad Ishaq Zaffar (Urdu: سahiBK. محمد īšāaq Zaffār; birth name: Muhammad Ali Shah) (29 April 1920 – 11 December 2002) was the last emperor of Afghanistan, a member of the Hashemi dynasty, and a cousin of the last King of Afghanistan, King Mohammed Zahir Shah. He was the eldest son of King Zahir Shah and his wife, Soraya Cornia (a granddaughter of the French President Raymond Poincaré). He ascended to the throne upon his father's forced retirement in 1978 but was overthrown two years later in a Soviet-backed coup. He spent much of the rest of his life exiled in Rome, along with his family. After the communist coup d'état of December 1978, King Zahir Shah was forced to abdicate. Afghans subsequently mourned the removal of the last king from the throne, but the country was ruled by a harsh communist regime led by Babrak Karmal. The country was soon invaded by Soviet troops, who installed the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan as the new government. The new government abolished the monarchy and moved the royal family into exile. Muhammad Ali Shah, his two younger brothers, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Ghulam Mohammed Shinwari, and his sister, Simone Cornia, settled in Rome, Italy, where they lived under protected immunity until they were forced to leave due to the September 11 attacks. Muhammad Ali Shah was educated in Italy, where he lived under a pseudonym and had a son, Abdul Malik. Muhammad Ali Shah died in Rome on December 11, 2002, at the age of 80. He was laid to rest in a mausoleum alongside his father and two brothers in the family cemetery in the Via Rasella cemetery in the Testaccio district of Rome. Early life and exile in Italy Muhammad Ali Shah was born in Rome, Italy on April 29, 1920. He was the eldest son of King Zahir Shah and his wife, Soraya. His full name at birth was Muhammad Ali Shah. His siblings were Mohammed Zahir Shah, Ghulam Mohammed Shinwari and Simone Cornia. Due to his exile, he was known by the nom de plume \"Sahibzada Ishaq Zaffar\" in the Italian language. His maternal grandparents were King Francis Joseph of Italy and his wife, Margherita of Savoy. His paternal grandparents were Prince Otto of Bavaria and his wife, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. His father was an Apostolic Kingdom, but his son would later accede to the throne of Afghanistan as the last emperor of Afghanistan. In 1944, Muhammad Ali Shah's family was granted sovereign immunity by the Italian government. They settled in the village of Testaccio, outside of Rome, where his father had relatives. His family lived in poverty, because his father, the exiled King Zahir Shah, could not provide for them. Muhammad Ali Shah had a low opinion of his father's regime in Afghanistan, because the royal family were under house arrest. After the King was overthrown, his family was forced to live in exile. The family's only means of support was the income from the land which they owned in Afghanistan, but that land had been seized by the communist government in 1979. Reign Reign as king (1978-2002) When King Zahir Shah was forced to retire by the communists, his eldest son, Muhammad Ali Shah, became the leader of the royal family. He ascended to the throne on December 27, 1978. King Zahir Shah's son Mohammed Zahir Shah returned from Saudi Arabia exile and accepted the crown in 1985. However, in September 1989, the communist regime was replaced by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Communist parties in Afghanistan were undermined by Mujahideen fighters who were supported by the US in the Afghan jihad, and the PDPA was replaced by mujahideen forces. Afghanistan was soon taken by civil war. Muhammad Ali Shah, his two younger brothers, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Ghulam Mohammed Shinwari, and his sister, Simone Cornia, settled in Rome, Italy, where they lived under protected immunity until they were forced to leave due to the September 11 attacks. During his reign, Muhammad Ali Shah's family and the rest of the royal family were living in exile. Due to his inexperience in ruling, the royal family were mostly left in the care of the elder brother, Mohammed Zahir Shah. In June 1987, Muhammad Ali Shah's brother-in-law, Prince Ghulam Mohammed Shinwari was murdered by the PDPA rebels.",

    "Linearization is a technique used in control theory to linearize the model around a desired operating point. It is an important step in the design of control systems and is used to compensate for the effects of nonlinearities in the system and ensure that the system behaves according to expectations. Forced oscillation tests are often used to linearize systems. A typical forced oscillation test generates an error signal by applying a known input to the system and measuring the output. The error signal is then amplified and sent as a force to a system output. The error signal is proportional to the error between the response of the system and the response that is expected based on the system's behavior around the desired operating point. The proportional constant of the error signal is the proportional gain. Using the proportional gain, the error between the actual response and the response that is expected can be expressed as a function of the input to the system. The system is linear if the relationship is proportional: if the input is equal to a constant a, then the output will be equal to a times the input. In this case, the proportional gain is equal to a. If the system is not linear, the proportional gain is a function of the input. In this case, the input is said to be non-linear with respect to the output. The gain is still referred to as proportional because if the input is set to 0, then the proportional gain will produce an output of 0. An example of a linear system is a speaker. When a sine wave is input to a speaker, the amplitude of the wave produced at the speaker's output is proportional to the amplitude of the input sine wave. The speaker is linear, meaning that if the input is linear with respect to the output, the system output is proportional to the input.",

    "Scottish School of Contemporary Dance was founded in 1983 by dancer and choreographer Kathleen Ritter. The school offers classes in several disciplines of contemporary dance, including but not limited to: ballet, pointe, modern, silks, Cunningham, lyrical, and street dance. The school's expansive facility is also home to the Diablo Dancing Academy, a division that offers classes in belly dance and kickboxing. Entertainment-sector professionals are attracted to the school's spacious facility and reputable program. Several former instructors have gone on to found their own successful dance companies, including Sammy J. Davenport (Fearless Turning) and Paul \"Sugarfoot\" Robinson (Jubilee!). originally known as the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC), the school was renamed in 2005 in order to increase its outreach and recognition. In 2016, the school was acquired by the Siuzo Company, a large for-profit company that runs art schools and has operated studios across the country. In 2017, the school's admission requirements were temporarily suspended after allegations of financial mismanagement were raised, but were reinstated the following year. In January 2023, Siuzo announced plans to sell the school as part of a wider move to restructure its asset portfolio. Following failed attempts to reach a buyer, the Siuzo Company was placed into administration in February 2023. The U.S. Federal government's bailout program took over the ownership of the school, and announced that it would begin negotiations to sell the assets to an as-yet-undisclosed buyer. The sale was completed in September 2023. Sylvie Morel was appointed as the school's new director. She had previously worked with the school as an instructor and administrator for over three decades. Upon completion of a nearly two-year nationwide search for a new owner, the Scottish School of Contemporary Dance was acquired by a group of private investors in March 2025. The school is now being run as a not-for-profit arts organization, with Sylvie Morel acting as the interim director alongside a board of directors.

    "I Don't Wanna Go to Bed As a teenager, there are many things that I look forward to, such as getting my driver's license and having a car, or getting an apartment of my own. These are exciting times as I get to experience the responsibilities of having my own money and a set of keys to a place that is all mine. But as exciting as these things are for me, they are extremely difficult for my mom, as she has to clean up after me, and make sure I am always safely home before she lets me have any fun. I don't wanna go to bed. When I was a kid, my mom would make my bed every night, and I would cry and tell her I wasn't sleepy. This didn't seem to matter, as she would tell me that it was time to sleep anyway, and I would just cry even more. My mom would then have to pick me up and move me to my bed, and I would kick and scream the entire time. Even now that I am an adult, I don't wanna go to bed. Every night before I go to sleep, I make sure that my room is neat and clean, and that my bed is made. I may not be tired, but I need to at least look like I am trying to sleep. I also may put on some very loud rock music, as my mom says that this helps me sleep. But guess what? I don't sleep at all. Instead, I just lie there and think about all of the things I want to do the next day, and my poor mom has to clean up after me again. I don't wanna go to bed.",

    "The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea Wikipedia article written by user HoppinJack The American Idea was first expressed by Alexis de Tocqueville in his work \"Democracy in America\", where he observed that American citizens were \"absorbed\" in their own private affairs and that social bonds were between individuals, not groups. The American Idea has since been used by many to characterize the unique blend of individualism and communalism that defines the United States. As President Obama said in his Nobel Peace Prize speech, \"The success of this experiment in self-government has given hope to millions around the world that what joins us here in this chamber – a shared commitment to justice, the rule of law, and the capacity of democratic institutions to change and improve themselves – extends not just to our little corner of the world, but to all people, in all places.\" Over time, however, the American Idea has come under attack as American society has become less homogenous and more divided. The nation's \"great experiment\" has also appeared to many to be failing as the lack of racial and gender diversity, increasing levels of income inequality, and rising violence have led many to fear that America was becoming an \"other world\" where diversity was being equated with lack of unity. Moreover, many viewed America's foreign policy as interventionist and imperialist, leading to anti-American sentiment and the election of Trump as president. However, many experts, including professors Richard Wright and Philip Zelikow, contend that the American Idea can be found in American society today in a remarkable way, and that Trump's election, while threatening, did not represent a rejection of the American Idea but instead its very definition. Rather than looking to a society with a unifying identity, Americans today seem to find community in differences, that is, in the intersectional identities that modernity enables. A wide gulf, they argue, separates the American Idea from the mean, vulgar, and offensive attitudes of Trump, and it is this perceived gap that gives liberals and conservatives their most cherished principles to defend. The danger today, they say, is that the Idea may be discounted, buried under a blanket of false universalism.

    "Rojo were a popular UK rock band who achieved critical acclaim in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band members were vocalist and guitarist Steve Brown, bassist Andy Lewis, drummer Phil Spikely, and guitarist Simon Peck. At the end of the 1980s, Rojo were earning a living by playing small concerts and backing other acts, including Happy Mondays, Blur and Oasis. In late 1989, they signed to Polydor Records and their debut album, Communique Static, was released in early 1990. The album's lead single, \"Spanish Bomber\", reached the top 5 in the UK, and the follow-up, \"You'll Never Be Alone\", reached No. 3. Their second album, Crucial, was released in 1994 and produced two further Top 5 hits with \"Sure thing\" and \"Diversion\". Rojo disbanded in 1996. Steve Brown and Andy Lewis formed The Treatment, and Phil Spikely and Simon Peck formed Oblivion Sun. Brown and Lewis later achieved success as songwriters and record producers. Awards In 1990, Rojo were nominated for a Brit Award for Best International Group. The band also won the Gold Badge Award at the 1993 Mobius Awards for their single \"Sure Thing\". later life Steve Brown and Andy Lewis formed The Treatment.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of processing a scapholunate interosseous ligament, and more particularly, to a method of preserving and transplanting the scapholunate interosseous ligament. 2. Description of the Related Art The scapholunate interosseous ligament is a ligamentous complex that stabilizes the scaphoid and the lunate bones of the wrist. It is a well-known finding that complete rupture of the scapholunate ligament complex causes typical subscaphoideal radiolunate instability, which is commonly known as dorsal subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. Osteocutaneous flaps of the fibula have traditionally been used to reconstruct the scapholunate ligament, but complications such as stiffness of the wrist and loss of strength in the transferred fibula have been reported. Using the muscle-tendon unit of the hypothenar eminence for reconstruction of the scapholunate ligament has been proposed as a good alternative to using an osteocutaneous flap. Preserving the scapholunate ligament with the attached muscle-tendon unit can prevent loss of strength in the reconstructed scapholunate ligament, as well as the associated complications, such as stiffness of the wrist. However, the complex relationship between the scapholunate ligament and the muscle-tendon unit makes it difficult to detach the muscle-tendon unit from the structures without damaging the muscle-tendon unit. Additionally, if the detached muscle-tendon unit is not preserved properly, the biomechanics of the reconstructed wrist joint may be affected. Thus, a method of preserving and transplanting the scapholunate interosseous ligament with the attached muscle-tendon unit is needed to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies.<|endoftext|>/* * (C) Copyright 2002 * Wolfgang Denk, DENX Software Engineering, wd@denx.de. * * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ */ #ifndef __TFT_H__ #define __TFT_H__ #define BT_DEFAULT_ROW_ADDR 0xFF #define TFT_DEFAULT_HEIGHT 16 #define TFT_DEFAULT_WIDTH 160 #define TFT_DEFAULT_INIT_SEQ (TFT_CE|TFT_RW|TFT_DEN|TFT_NLS|TFT_HS) /* LCD parallel mode */ #define LCD_PCLK (*(vu_char *)KP_CLK) /* Chip select pin */ #define CS_CAFS (*(vu_char *)GPIO_NUM_2) #define CS_SPSO (*(vu_char *)GPIO_NUM_3) #define CS_NSS_PIN",
    "Hyacinthoides paivae, also known as paivae hyacinth, Cape hyacinth, or silver waterlily, is a rare plant species found only in South Africa. Originally discovered in 1727 by Frederick Maurice Clifford, it was rediscovered in 2006 by scientists working in the Drakensberg, the range of mountains where it is found. The exact distribution of the species is still uncertain, but it is likely to be declining due to habitat loss. The name of the species is derived from the Paiva horse, a breed of horse also known as the Anglo-Arab. Clifford's assistant, Andrew Payment, brought the seed of the plant home with him on this horse, and the breed is commemorated in the genus name of the plant and the epithet of the species. Hyacinthoides paivae is a large perennial herb, growing up to 2 m tall. It has broad linear leaves, between 10 and 20 cm long and 3 and 5 cm wide, varying in colour from dark green to blue-green. The large, showy flowers are yellow, orange or red, sometimes with darker centres. The species is named for the large, showy, central flowers. The flowers appear from September to November, depending on the altitude, and last for a few weeks. The plant grows in grassy mountain habitats at altitudes of 2000 to 3000 m, and is threatened by habitat loss. It is classified as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, and several subspecies have been named. The number of populations is uncertain, but there are thought to be fewer than 2000 mature individuals. Hyacinthoides paivae is closely related to the closely-related H. majalis, H. pubescens, H. intermedia and H. versicolor. It can be distinguished by its larger leaves, which are sometimes variegated, the colour of the flowers and the distribution range. Hyacinthoides paivae requires well-drained soil, full sun and snowfall each year, with a period of frost. It grows well in captivity, and has been propagated by cuttings. As a vulnerable species, the Paiva hyacinth has the world's attention, and it is being cared for by the South African National Parks. This includes propagation, monitoring and maintenance of populations, with the aim of growing enough plants to repopulate areas of suitable habitat. A number of organizations are involved, including Paiva horse breeders, private landowners and government agencies. The propagation and monitoring of populations is a joint initiative between the Drayden Valley Farmers' Union and the provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Paiva horse breeders are providing seeds and allowing plants to be propagated for reintroduction into suitable habitats. The range of the species is being monitored by the Eastern Cape regional office of the South African National Parks, using traditional knowledge and landscape-level mapping. The goal is to increase the number of populations from the present few thousand to at least 10,000, and to document the species' distribution. To this end, Paiva horse breeders are being trained to conduct vegetation mapping. Paiva horse breeders and the provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are also working to secure landowners' permission to establish populations on their land. In addition, Paiva horse breeders are establishing \"spreader populations\", which can be used to expand the distribution of plants once they have been introduced into suitable habitat. Spreader populations will provide a source of seeds that can be dispersed by blowing or hand-cast. The Paiva horse is a small, rare, native horse breed that originated in South Africa. It is named after Andrew Payment's Paiva horse, which carried the first-known sample of the species to science in 1727. It is a hardy and intelligent breed, used for driving and riding, but has almost been extinct since the 19th century. Paiva horse breeders are working to save this breed from extinction by propagating and reintroducing it into suitable habitat. This will be done by mapping suitable habitat and distributing plants to establish populations, with monitoring and maintenance by South African National Parks. The Eastern Cape regional office of South African National Parks is coordinating the initiative, which will use traditional knowledge and landscape-level mapping, as well as training Paiva horse breeders in mapping. The goal is to increase the number of populations from the present few thousand to at least 10,000, and to document the species' distribution. Paiva horse breeders are being trained to conduct vegetation mapping. Landowners who own land that could potentially be suitable for the establishment of populations are being encouraged to participate. They will need to secure permission before allowing the establishment",
    "CHKT (900 MHz band) is a radio band used for wireless communications. It is located in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically defined as beginning at 300 MHz and extending upwards to 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Hz. The CHKT band was formerly used for military communications in the United States and other countries, and is now used primarily for broadband wireless Internet and other low-power communications applications. mag CHKT (900 MHz band) is a radio band used for wireless communications. It is located in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically defined as beginning at 300 MHz and extending upwards to 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Hz. The CHKT band was formerly used for military communications in the United States and other countries, and is now used primarily for broadband wireless Internet and other low-power communications applications. Notably, the 900 MHz band was the original target of the 2020 US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) incentive auction, which was intended to financially incentivize the transition from private to public ownership of band frequencies. However, the auction failed to meet its goals, leading the FCC to cancel the sale of spectrum in the band and striking a new plan to monetize the band through other means. The band's former radio equipment must be removed from the band by 2020. Communications in the 900 MHz band occur at very low power levels and are highly directional, making the band well-suited for remote transmission of data and communicating control signals between entities that are proximate to each other, but not widely distributed. Examples of use of the band include WiFi and Bluetooth connections between smartphones, and online streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube take advantage of the band's high capacity and low cost. Although the band is lightly used, regulators have expressed concern about harmful emissions in the vicinity of the band's communications caused by accidental or intentional radiators. While the 900 MHz band is not closed to new devices, manufacturers are not required to certify their equipment in the band, making it difficult for consumers to purchase equipment that operates in the band. Although the 900 MHz band is a prime candidate for unlicensed use, its current regulatory situation has deterred private industry from developing significant use of the band for commercial communication purposes. Additionally, the band is subject to interference from other licensed systems using the band, especially when operating near larger urban areas. Industry participants view a relocation of the band to a higher portion of the radio spectrum as an attractive solution to these problems, but there are no extant plans to relocate the band at this time.",
    "Computer America was a supercomputer at NASA Langley Research Center, which was dedicated on September 29, 2011 and retired in June 21, 2023. Computer America was capable of performing 80 trillion calculations per second, this made it the fourth most powerful supercomputer in the world as of 2011. sound like something you could do with a computer in the year 2023? well in 2021 America started to worry about its economic future andComputer America was commissioned to help find a solution. Over the next decade America became detached from the rest of the world as its powers becameneeded for NASA research. After decades of service America was retired in 2112, and turned into an museum with public tours. ADVERTISEMENT internet in the late 20th century led to the development of supercomputers, as large computing systems were cost-effective for the first time. The first generation of supercomputers were built out of custom designed chips built by companies like IBM, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. The cost of building a supercomputer was heavily dependant on the amount of processors and storage you wanted, the more powerful the computer the more you had to pay for the components. BACK America was the first supercomputer to be built out of off-the-shelf computer parts, this was made possible by innovations in internet infrastructure and cloud computing which made it feasible to have a large number of commodity servers online at any given time. This allowed for computers to be build out of more basic components, lowering the cost of building the computer.",

    "A Letter for Tomorrow <begin letter> July 4, 2023 My Dearest <His/Her/Their>, By now you have received my initial message. Perhaps you have read the text messages I sent two years ago. If not, I hope you still have those. If so, it is likely that you have found this letter by now. If I had the chance, I would tell you everything from the very beginning. I would explain to you how I came to write this letter and all the decisions and twists of fate that brought us here today. I would tell you how I first met your mother. How my life changed the day you were born. And how we found out less than a year later that you would be happy. But now all of that is in the past. What matters now is the future. I wish I could tell you that I have found a way to return you to your home in the past. But though I have discovered the sequence of events that led us here, I do not have the skills to change or halt them. And so, I must tell you that the letter I am now sending will reach you in the future. It is my hope that you will find it when you do. And that you will know how much I love you. And that I am sorry that I could not be with you as you start this next phase of your life. Always, Your father",
    "The GNU Compiler Collection, commonly abbreviated GCC, is a free software project for implementing a compiler that generates code for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the GNU Compiler Infrastructure (GCI) LLVM. It is the most popular compiler for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages. It is released as open source, with versions 4.3.1 and later being developed in the GCC repository on GitHub. The compiler is currently developed by a large community of programmers, including individual volunteer developers as well as companies and organizations whose purpose is to contribute and improve the development of the compiler. GCC is distributed under a variety of free and open software licenses. The latest version of GCC is 7.3, released in December 2022. At the start of 2023, the GCC development team announced that they would be freezing the versions of GCC below 7.4 after 2022, and would no longer accept new features or bug fixes to GCC versions 6 or 7. New development will continue on 8 and later, with the 7.3 branch being considered fully stabilized. The following year, the GCC development team again reduced the support period for versions 6 and 7. Now only security fixes for these versions will be accepted; new features and bug fixes will no longer be developed for them, and they will no longer receive security updates. The 6 series is still supported by vendor releases such as those from Apple, and a 7.1 release is also still available from the GCC website. In July 2023, the GCC development team informed the community that a new branch of the compiler, version 8, would be the last major release for the 6 and 7 series. From this point on, only bug fixes and security updates will be provided for those versions. The decision to stop development for versions 6 and 7 was made due to a lack of developer interest, with no new features being proposed for inclusion, and existing features being subject to debate on whether or not to retain compatibility with older software that depends on them. The freezing of versions also reduces the need to support these older versions, and so reduces the associated costs. There are still some users who need support for older versions, and so vendors are still providing security updates for versions 6.13 and 6.14, as well as major releases 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. The GCC development team will continue to provide security updates for the 8 series, until at least 2024. The GCC compiler is used by several other free compilers for similar languages, including LLVMc for C++. The GCC compiler is used in many distributions' installation media. For instance, the Fedora Project uses it to create the Fedora operating system, and Ubuntu uses it to create its installation DVDs. The GCC compiler supports a large number of programming language features and has a large user and developer community. Its popularity stems in part from its mature feature set and ease of use, but also from its GPL v3-licensed software architecture, which provides access to the inner workings of the compiler for implementers and researchers. The GCC Compiler Collection is the most popular compiler for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages. It is open source and has a large development and user community. For more information: * https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc-compiler-collection/ * Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, and the Free Software Foundation's president, wrote the original proposal that became the foundation of the GCC project."
