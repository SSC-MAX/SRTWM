    " Caregiver burden Caregiver burden is the physical, emotional, and financial strain placed on a person who is caring for a chronically ill or disabled family member. The concept is often discussed in the context of caring for an elderly relative, such as a parent or grandparent, but it is applicable to any family member who requires ongoing care. Caregiver burden is often discussed in terms of the emotional and physical strain that results from providing care, as well as the financial strain that results from the costs of providing care. The physical and emotional strain of caregiving can be significant, and can have negative consequences for both the caregiver and the person being cared for. Caregivers often experience physical exhaustion, as well as psychological distress, such as depression and anxiety. In some cases, caregivers may also experience financial strain, as the costs of providing care can be significant. There are a number of ways that caregivers can reduce the physical and emotional strain of caregiving, and improve their own well-being. Getting enough rest and exercise, and seeking support from friends and family members can help caregivers to feel better and more energized. In some cases, caregivers may also benefit from seeking professional help, such as from a therapist or counselor, to help them cope with the emotional challenges of caregiving. Caregiver burden is a term that is used to describe the physical, emotional, and financial strain placed on a person who is providing care to a chronically ill or disabled family member. Caregiver burden is often discussed in terms of the emotional and physical strain that results from providing care, as well as the financial strain that results from the costs of providing care.

    " Alert in the Mediterranean The Mediterranean Sea is a site of major strategic importance, as it is the only access route to Europe for many countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as being a major thoroughfare for oil and gas shipping. As a result, the area has been the scene of many international crises, including several major wars. The earliest known conflict in the Mediterranean region was the Trojan War, which occurred in the early Bronze Age. The war was fought between the kingdoms of Troy and Mycenaean Greece and was recorded in the works of Homer, including the Iliad and the Odyssey. The conflict is generally dated to the late Bronze Age, with a conventional date of around 1200 BC. In the early Iron Age, the Mediterranean region was home to a number of powerful city-states, including Athens, Sparta, and Corinth. The Peloponnesian War, which was fought between Athens and Sparta from 431 BC to 404 BC, was one of the most significant conflicts in the region during this period. The war featured a number of major battles, including the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of 404 BC, and resulted in the defeat of Athens and the rise of Sparta as the dominant power in the region. The Roman Republic became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region in the first century BC, and the Roman Empire maintained control of the region for much of the next thousand years. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD was followed by a period of fragmentation, with a number of smaller states emerging in the region. In the seventh century, the Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa brought much of the region under the control of the Caliphates. The Muslim states of Spain and Sicily also emerged as significant powers in the Mediterranean during this period. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Mediterranean region was the scene of a number of major religious wars, including the Crusades and the Barbary Wars. The Crusades were a series of religious wars between the Christian Crusaders and the Muslim Turks, and resulted in the recapture of the Holy Land from Muslim control. The Barbary Wars were fought between the Christian Europeans and the Muslim pirates of North Africa, and resulted in the gradual decline of the Barbary States. The Mediterranean region was also the scene of a number of major naval conflicts, including the Russo-Turkish War, the War of the Third Coalition, and the Battle of Lepanto. The Russo-Turkish War was fought between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire in the 1850s, and resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans and the rise of the Russians as a major power in the region. The War of the Third Coalition was fought between the British Empire, the Austrian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia against the First French Empire and the Kingdom of Spain in the early 1800s, and resulted in the defeat of the French and the rise of the British and Austrians as major powers in the region. The Battle of Lepanto was fought between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire in the late 1500s, and resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans and the rise of the Holy League as the dominant power in the region.",
    " Limni, Euboea Limni (Greek: Λίμνη, [ˈlimnɛː]), is a town in the central part of Euboea, Greece. It is the seat of the municipality of Karystos. It is located on the west coast of the island, on a bay between Capes Dafnias and Karvounades. Its population in 2011 was 1,325. There are several beaches in the vicinity, the most popular being that of Limni. The beach has been awarded the Blue Flag. Very close to Limni, at a distance of approximately 1 km, there is a beach with black sand and a small port, known as Ai Sostis (or Aï-Soussi). The town has a small port, which provides a daily connection to Skyros and Kymi on the island of Evia. In the area of Limni, several olive trees of great age can be found. One of them, known as \"Mavri olive tree\", has been declared a protected natural monument. The area of Limni has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era. In the 3rd century BC, Limni was one of the two harbours of the city of Eretria. The ancient city had two small theatres and an acropolis. It also had a temple dedicated to Artemis, where many offerings were found. In the 2nd century AD, a basilica dedicated to the patron saint of the city, Apollo, was built. The city was destroyed in 1398 by the Ottoman Turks. The inhabitants fled to the mountains, where they founded the village of Karystos. In the following years, the area of Limni was abandoned. In 1880, Limni became an independent community and the seat of a municipality, which in 1964 was united with that of Karystos.",
    " The Kashgar–Hotan railway or Kargar–Hotan railway is a railway in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, between Kashgar and Hotan. The railway runs 230 km (143 mi) from Kashgar to a point just west of Hotan and is a branch of the Kashgar–Urumqi railway. The railway was built in two stages. The first stage, from Kashgar to Shrêngle, was built by the Chinese government in the 1980s. The second stage, from Shrêngle to Hotan, was built by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in the 1990s. The two sections were combined in 2009. The railway provides a vital link to the Tarim Basin, and is the first step in a proposed railway network that would span the entire Tarim Basin, connecting cities such as Turpan, Korla, Kuqa, and Aksu. The Kashgar–Hotan railway has been named one of the eight key projects of the National Development and Reform Commission's 2016 transportation plan. In August 2016, the name of the railway was changed to the Kashgar–Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, and the branch line from Hotan to Qarqan was opened on 1 July 2018.",
    " Siegfried Haag (24 June 1935 – 8 October 2016) was a German physicist and author. Haag was a professor of physics at the Technische Universität Darmstadt from 1971 to 1996, where he held the chair of theoretical physics, which had been vacant since the death of Max Born in 1970. Haag was also the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Darmstadt University of Technology from 1976 to 1996. In the late 1970s, Haag, together with John Ilias, developed the concept of the Axion, a weakly coupled spin-1/2 particle with a mass much larger than the proton, but much smaller than the neutron. This particle was expected to be strictly stable and could not be produced by any known process. In 1985, a possible experimental signature for axions was proposed by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes. In the same year, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz and Andrew Stromberg showed that a non-zero axion mass would necessarily imply the existence of a new type of particle, the axion-like particle (ALP). The axion-like particle is expected to be very light, possibly as light as the electron, with a mass much smaller than that of the proton. There are several ongoing experiments that are trying to detect axions. Haag was the author or co-author of more than 150 scientific publications, including the books The Axion Enigma (with N. O. Rowson, 1992) and The New Quantum Mechanics (with J. A. Miller, 1995). He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Statistical Society. In 1997 he received the Max Born Prize for his contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics. Haag died on 8 October 2016 at the age of 81.",

    " MT9 is a human gene that provides instructions for making a protein called melanotransferrin. This protein is found in the skin, hair, and other tissues, and it plays an important role in the transportation of melanin, a pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their characteristic color. The MT9 gene is located on chromosome 8, along with several other genes that are involved in the production of melanin. The MT9 protein is made up of two regions, called the N and C terminals, which are separated by a region called the MELANOTRANSFERRIN_ midregion. The N-terminal region is responsible for binding to a protein called transferrin, which helps to transport the melanotransferrin protein to other cells. The C-terminal region is responsible for binding to melanin, and it is this region that gives the protein its characteristic color. The MT9 gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the skin, hair, and other pigment-bearing tissues. It is also expressed in the brain, liver, and kidney, as well as in certain types of cancer cells. The expression of the MT9 gene is regulated by a protein called microphthalmia (MITF), which is involved in the development and maintenance of pigment-bearing tissues. The MT9 gene is a candidate gene for a number of diseases and conditions that are related to the production of melanin, including albinism, vitiligo, and cancer. Mutations in the MT9 gene can lead to a reduction in the production of melanin, which can result in the development of these diseases and conditions. The MT9 gene is also a target gene for a number of transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific DNA sequences. These transcription factors can either increase or decrease the expression of the MT9 gene, depending on the specific DNA sequence that they bind to. In summary, the MT9 gene is a gene that provides instructions for making the melanotransferrin protein, which is involved in the transportation of melanin. The MT9 gene is located on chromosome 8, and it is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the skin, hair, and other pigment-bearing tissues. Mutations in the MT9 gene can lead to a reduction in the production of melanin, which can result in the development of diseases and conditions that are related to the production of melanin.

    " Niram Maratha Pookal is a 1967 Indian Tamil-language thriller film directed by D. R. Sundar. The film stars Jaishankar, K. R. Vijaya, C. R. Vijayakumari, M. N. Nambiar, and Manorama in the lead roles. The film, produced by G. D. Venu, had musical score by T. K. Ramamoorthy and was released on 1 November 1967. The film is based on the short story of the same name by G. R. India. The film is about a happy-go-lucky man, who has no interest in life, wealth or position, finds himself drawn into a web of intrigue when he unknowingly agrees to marry a woman with a mysterious past. The film was remade in Telugu as Nindu Hridayalu and in Hindi as Niraasthasi. Plot In the past, a man is murdered and his wife, Chitra, is found unconscious. The murder is investigated by police officer Rajarajan, and the case is closed when the murder weapon, a pair of scissors, is found. In the present, Jaishankar (newly-weds husband) and Vijayakumari (newly-wed wife) are on their honeymoon. While at the hotel, Jaishankar's friend Prem Anand (his friend) arrives and tells him about a Marwadi woman, Niram Marwadi, who is looking for a husband. Jaishankar, for a lark, goes to meet her and finds that she is the same woman who was his neighbour in his childhood. He finds that her husband, who was a Marwadi, had died, and she has returned from the United States to look for a new husband. Jaishankar decides to marry her, and she accepts. During the wedding, Niram's brother suddenly arrives and objects to the marriage. He says that his sister is already married, and her husband is a Marwadi. Jaishankar is confused, and asks how this can be, since the man she was married to in the past was a Tamil. Niram's brother reveals that after her marriage, her husband had died in an accident. However, the couple had already purchased a house, and the deed to the house was in the husband's name. The brother wants to sell the house to a builder, but the deeds have been lost. The only way to get the deeds is to have Niram marry a Marwadi. Jaishankar is worried because he has already married Vijayakumari. To make matters worse, the brother threatens to kill Jaishankar if he does not marry Niram. Later, the brother is found dead in his room, and it is implied that he was killed by Niram. The police suspect Jaishankar, since he was the last person to see the brother alive. Jaishankar tells Rajarajan that he is innocent, and the real murderer is Niram. He says that he knows this because he had intercepted a letter that was written by Niram to her brother. However, the police find that the letter is actually a blank sheet of paper. It is revealed that Niram's brother was killed by a man named Rappoport, who had come to collect money that was owed to him. Rappoport was accidentally killed by Niram, who was hiding in the house at the time. To cover up the murder, Niram framed her brother's death as an accident. However, since the deed to the house was in his name, she needed to find a Marwadi to marry so that she could claim ownership of the house. The police arrive at the house where Rappoport was killed, and find a man named therein. He says that he had come to visit his sister, Niram, and was shocked to find that she had been murdered. He also says that Rappoport had come to collect money that was owed to him, and that he had accidentally killed him while trying to stop him from attacking his sister. The film ends with Jaishankar and Vijayakumari driving away, with the implication that they will live happily ever after.",

    " Goyescas (Goyescas) Goyescas is a one-act opera by the composer Enrique Granados, who described it as a \"poesía lírica\". The opera, to a libretto by the poet and playwright José de Selgas, is based on the legend of the abduction of the Moorish princess Zayda by the Galician count Don Fernando. The title Goyescas refers to the Galicians, but is also a pun on the word goyesca, meaning \"Goyaesque\". The opera was first performed at the Teatre de la Zarzuela in Madrid on 19 November 1911, with some sections of the score having been orchestrated by de Selgas himself. In a letter to his friend the composer Pablo de Sarasate, Granados described the first night as a \"total fiasco\". The opera was given a second performance at the same theatre on 25 November, with a third the following night. The critics were more favourable on the second and third nights, but the opera's run was nonetheless cut short. A revised version of the opera, with a new finale, was premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 18 May 1914, with the composer conducting. The new finale, which is now the standard version, has a more optimistic ending, with the return of Zayda and the reconciliation of the lovers. The Paris production was given in London the following year, with Thomas Allen as Don Fernando. Goyescas is scored for two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, percussion, two harps and strings. The opera's most famous melody, which is heard at the beginning of Act II, is the \"Romanza\", which is also known as the \"Goyescas theme\". This theme, which is performed by a solo violin with pizzicato strings, is based on a leitmotif which appears throughout the opera. The \"Romanza\" is not included in the opera's original score, but was added by Granados for the Paris production. It has been arranged for various instruments, and has become a popular concert piece.",
    " Anna Swanwick (30 March 1813 – 25 May 1899) was an English author of children's books, and a writer and speaker on the feminist cause. She was also known by her married name, Anna Julia Herschel. Swanwick was born in Birmingham, England in 1813, the daughter of Joseph Swanwick (1780–1836) and his wife, Anna (1785–1837). Her father was a Unitarian minister and her mother was also very active in the Unitarian church. Along with her brother, the chemist Joseph Henry Swanwick (1802–1843), she was educated at a private school in Birmingham, and then at a boarding school in Warwick. In 1832, she went to live with her brother in London, where she studied music, and also began a friendship with the feminist writer Catherine Macaulay. Swanwick began writing for children in the 1840s, and published her first book, The Ferry, in 1844. Her works were notable for their didacticism, and she was a strong advocate for children's education. Her best-known work was the series of \"Good Books\" which she began publishing in 1846, with the title The Good Book for the Little Ones. These books were designed to introduce children to the major world religions, and were illustrated by her friend, the artist Maria Helena Vieira da Silva (1795–1858). In 1847, Swanwick married the German-born physicist and astronomer Sir John Herschel (1792–1871), and the couple had two sons, Henry (1849–1930) and Charles (1851–1921). After her marriage, Swanwick continued to write, and also worked to promote the feminist cause. In the 1850s, she published a series of articles in the feminist magazine The English Woman's Journal, and in 1858, she published a book on the subject, A Woman's Words on Women's Rights. In 1864, she published a collection of her essays, Essays and Notes on Social Subjects. Swanwick was a strong supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and in 1868, she became a founding member of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage. She was also a founding member of the Women's Emancipation Union, and a frequent speaker at the organisation's meetings. In the 1870s, she published a series of articles on the subject of women's suffrage, and in 1877, she published a book on the subject, The Question of Women's Suffrage. Swanwick died in 1899, at the age of 86.",
    " Pope Francis (Italian: Francesco; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio; 17 December 1936) is the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State. He was elected on 13 March 2013 by a two-thirds majority of the eligible cardinals in the 2013 papal conclave that followed the resignation of his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Ordained as a priest in 1969 in his native Argentina, Bergoglio embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1970s. He was appointed a full professor in 1980 at the age of 43. After a long career as a professor of theology and an academic administrator, Bergoglio was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. In 2001, he was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 2008, he was elected to the position of dean of the College of Cardinals. Bergoglio's pastoral style was different from that of his predecessors. He placed a strong emphasis on the Catholic Church's social teaching, and was considered a \"pope of the poor\" due to his extensive work with the poor and his critique of the political and economic system that neglects them. He was described as \"the main intellectual force in the Church\" since the mid-1980s. On 11 February 2013, Benedict XVI announced his resignation, citing a \"lack of strength of mind and body\" due to his advanced age. He was the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415 and the first on a pope's initiative since Celestine V in 1294. After the conclave that followed his resignation, Bergoglio was elected to the office of pope on 13 March 2013 and was installed on 13 April 2013. Bergoglio's handling of sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church and opposition to the usage of condoms in areas of high HIV transmission, despite their effectiveness in preventing the spread of HIV, led to substantial criticism from public health officials, anti-AIDS activists, and victims' rights organizations.",
    " Malva assurgentiflora is a species of plant in the family Malvaceae, native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It was first described in 1862 by the German–British astronomer and naturalist Sir John Herschel. The specific name assurgentiflora is derived from the Latin verb surgere meaning \"to rise up\" and the Latin word florere meaning \"to flower\". This perennial herbaceous plant consists of a low rosette of basal leaves up to 5 cm in diameter, from which one or more flowering stalks develop. The blades of the basal leaves are up to 3 cm long by 3.5 cm wide, although they are typically about one-half of this size during the dry season. The margins of the blades are crenate and the tips are mucronate. The upper surface of the blades is medium green and glabrous to pubescent, while the lower surface is pale green and either glabrous, pubescent, or pubescent with white hairs. The petioles are 5–8 cm long and pubescent (hairs are especially likely to occur toward the bases of the petioles). The petioles are pubescent with stellate hairs, hispid hairs, or a mixture of both. The ascending pedicels of the flowers are 5–7 cm long, light green to reddish green, terete, and glabrous (less often pubescent). The apices of the pedicels are terminated by the axils of the sepals. The sepals are light green to reddish green, lanceolate, and 5–7 mm long. The basal lobes of the sepals are short and rounded, while the apical lobes are long and acute. The petals are light pink to lavender, and the petal blades are approximately 2.5 cm long by 1.8 cm wide. The petal blades are cordate, crenate, and mucronate. The basal lobes are short and rounded, while the apical lobes are long and acute. The stigmas are 2–3 mm long and shortly bilobulate. The styles are 5–7 mm long. The fruit is a globoid to ovoid capsule, 2–3 cm in diameter, with a short, apical beak. The capsule is covered with short, appressed, incurved hairs that are sometimes barbed. At maturity, the capsules divide into three parts, flinging their contents in the process. The tiny seeds are 1.5–2 mm long and globoid to ovoid. They are pubescent with short, white hairs.",

    " Veena Music Veena music is the name given to music that is played on the veena. The veena is a generic term for a plucked instrument, with many variations, and is thus somewhat similar to the guitar. Although the veena may be found in many different regions, it is typically associated with the Indian subcontinent. The oldest veena in India is the veena dussels, which dates back to the 3rd century BC. It is a very large instrument, with a neck that can be as long as 5 feet (1.5 m) and is made out of a single piece of wood. The body of the instrument is made out of a large piece of log, and the instrument is played by sitting on the ground. The veena dussels was traditionally used as a solo instrument, and as such, is typically associated with the Indian classical music tradition. However, it is also used in many other genres of music, including folk, pop, and filmi. The most common veena in India is the veena ekaki, which is a smaller instrument, with a neck that is typically around 2 feet (0.6 m) in length. It is played by holding the neck in one hand, and plucking the strings with the fingers of the other hand. The veena ekaki is used in both solo and ensemble performances, and is a key instrument in many different genres of music, including Indian classical music, folk, pop, and filmi. It is also used in many different regional styles, such as the Carnatic music of South India, and the Hindustani music of North India. The veena gauvau is another type of veena that is popular in India. It is similar to the veena ekaki, but has a deeper body, and is played by sitting on the ground. The veena gauvau is used in both solo and ensemble performances, and is a key instrument in many different genres of music, including Indian classical music, folk, pop, and filmi. It is also used in many different regional styles, such as the Carnatic music of South India, and the Hindustani music of North India.",

Haas was born in Dieterich, Illinois. He attended Mater Dei High School in Breese, Illinois, and upon graduating in 1993, attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale. He and his brother were introduced to the wrestling business by their older brother, Lanny. They began training with \"Maniac\" Mike Miller in Illinois, and after they had gained some experience, they moved to Venice, Florida, to train with Mike Boyette. The Hardy brothers made their professional wrestling debut on the independent circuit in 1996, and were soon signed by WCW. In WCW, they were known for their participation in the cruiserweight division, and for their high-risk, exciting style, which included the use of tables, ladders, and chairs (TLC). At the 1997 Slamboree event, they won the WCW Tag Team Championship, and held them until the following September, when they lost to the NWO (New World Order) tag team of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who had just won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from the Steiner Brothers. After the NWO took over WCW in the summer of 1997, the Hardy brothers were feuding with the dominant group, and were eventually fired, along with several other wrestlers who were loyal to WCW. They returned to the independent circuit, and also made appearances in the WWF, where they were defeated by the tag team of The Undertaker and Kane. In 1999, the Hardy brothers returned to WCW, and won the WCW Tag Team Championship for a second time in 2000, defeating The Harris Brothers (Michael and Harris). They held the title until the September 11, 2000 episode of Monday Nitro, when they lost to The Harris Brothers in a match that was nationally broadcast on TNT.

They returned to the WWF in early 2001, and won the WWF Tag Team Championship in July 2001, defeating the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). They held the title until the September 16, 2001 episode of SmackDown!, when they lost to The Undertaker and Kane in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.

    " Nini Haslund Gleditsch (born in Oslo, 21 December 1918 – died in Oslo, 16 January 2009) was a Norwegian journalist, author, and women's rights activist. She is best known for her book Hvem er Norge? (\"Who Is Norway?\"), which in 1961 became the first popular history of Norway written by a woman. Gleditsch was born in Oslo, the daughter of Erik Haslund, a lawyer, and his wife Nini, née Midtsjø. She grew up in a well-to-do family, and her father's work meant that the family often lived abroad. She attended schools in Oslo, Copenhagen, and Geneva, and completed her secondary education at Oslo Cathedral School in 1937. She then studied history at the University of Oslo, graduating in 1941. In the late 1930s, Gleditsch was involved with the feminist organizationkvinnerådets forening (the Women's Council), and in 1939 she was one of the founders of the feminist magazine Nylænde.

In 1942, she married the historian Martin Gleditsch, and the couple had three daughters. After the war, Gleditsch was a journalist for the newspaper Arbeiderbladet, and from 1949 she worked as a freelance journalist, writing articles on history, politics, and women's issues. She was also a regular contributor to the magazine Det Nye, and in 1951 she published a book on the history of the Norwegian Students' Society. In 1960, she published a collection of articles on women's issues titled Nå er det nok! (It's About Time!). In 1961, Gleditsch published the book Hvem er Norge?, a popular history of Norway which covered the country's development from the early medieval period to the present day. The book was widely read, and has been reprinted several times. In the book, Gleditsch emphasized the importance of women's history, and she presented a positive picture of women's role in Norwegian society. Gleditsch was a member of the Norwegian Historical Association, and in 1988 she was awarded the Norwegian Historical Association's gold medal.

    " Birlinn ( Scots: birlinn, birell, byrel, biel, bil; from the Old Irish: birlinn) is a type of small, fast-sailing vessel used in the Hebrides and the Scottish west coast from the 12th to the 16th centuries. It was a successor to the Viking longship, and has been described as \"the fastest type of vessel that has ever been built\". The birlinn was a highly manoeuvrable and scalable vessel, with a basic design that could be adapted to different uses and roles. Although it has been described as a type of galley, it was actually a development of the open boat, with a single mast that could be raised and lowered, and a rectangular sail. It could also be rowed, with a rowlock at the end of each oar. The hull was made of light materials, such as timber, with a framework of longitudinal and transverse beams. The birlinn's design and construction made it an ideal vessel for fast interception and reconnaissance. It could also carry a substantial payload. The size of the crew and the number of oars varied according to the size of the vessel. The birlinn was developed from the Viking longship, which began to be used in the Hebrides in the 10th century. The longship was a fast and highly manoeuvrable vessel, but it had a shallow draft and was unstable in rough seas. The birlinn was designed to be more stable and to carry a heavier payload. It was also faster, due to its deeper draft and larger sail. The birlinn was used for a variety of purposes, including coastal trade, fishing, and warfare. It was also used for transport and as a naval vessel. In the 14th and 15th centuries, it was used by the Scottish royal fleet. The birlinn was a highly manoeuvrable vessel, making it ideal for inshore work and for landing on beaches. It could also be used for longer-distance journeys, and could carry a substantial payload.

    " Euseby Cleaver (fl. 15th–16th century) was an English compiler of medieval manuscripts. Cleaver was a Catholic who lived in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII. He was associated with the church of St. Margaret in Lynn, Norfolk, and may have been a priest. He is known only from a single manuscript, now in the British Library (MS Harley 674). This manuscript is a collection of historical texts, mostly concerning the medieval kings of England. The first part of the manuscript is a copy of the contemporary De regis Angliae genealogia of John de Fordun, which was written in the early 14th century. The manuscript also contains the works of earlier medieval historians, such as William of Malmesbury, Historia Regum, and Henry of Huntingdon, Historia Anglorum. The manuscript is notable for containing the only known copy of the 15th century illuminated romance, The King and the Quene, which is related to the story of How Bold Sir Guy bore the banner. The manuscript is preserved at the British Library. A typescript facsimile of the Harley MS 674 was made by the Historical Manuscripts Commission in the early 20th century, and is available in some libraries.",

    " Tessera (Venus) Tessera, also called tesserae, is a term used by archaeologists to describe the small, flat, roughly square stones that were used as votes in democratic elections in the ancient Roman Republic. In the Roman constitutional tradition, citizens had several rights and duties. One of these was the right to vote. In the early Republic, voting was done by a show of hands, but as the population grew, this method became unwieldy. By the end of the 4th century BC, voting by ballot (tesserae) was introduced. Each voter would write the name of the candidate he was voting for on a small piece of wood, usually wax-coated, called a tessera. In order to prevent fraud, the tessera was marked with a letter or symbol so that illiterate citizens could cast the correct vote. The marked tessera was then placed in a large pile with those of other voters. The votes were then counted and the candidate with the majority of votes was elected. A similar method was used for voting on laws and other matters of state. However, the voters in this case used a different type of tessera, called a ballotarium, which had two sides, both of which could be written on. The voter would write \"Aye\" or \"No\" on one side and then turn the tessera over and write the name of the law on the other side.",

    " John Anthony West (born December 25, 1932) is an American writer, explorer, historian, and inventor, known for his investigations of ancient mysteries and his theories regarding the submerged ruins of the lost city of Atlantis in the Bahamas. West was born in Dallas, Texas. He served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957, reaching the rank of first lieutenant. He received a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Texas at Austin in 1961 and a Master of Arts in English from the University of Denver in 1963. He taught English at Manual High School in Denver, Colorado, from 1964 to 1967 and at Western High School in Denver from 1967 to 1970. In 1970 he quit teaching to devote his full attention to his writing career. West's first book, The Silphium Quest, was published in 1969. This was followed by The Gold of Atlantis, or the Lost Lemuria (1971), an expansion of his doctoral dissertation on the legend of Atlantis, and The Secret History of the World (1973), a work which presents his theory that the world's ancient myths and legends are based on actual historical events. West's works are based on the idea that an advanced prehistoric civilization, which he calls the \"pre-flood high culture,\" once existed and that the survivors of this civilization fled to the higher ground of the Himalayas, the Andes, and the other great mountain ranges of the world to escape the rising Flood, and founded the \"post-flood\" or \"secondary\" civilizations of the world. The ancient myths and legends of these secondary civilizations, West believes, contain the memory of the pre-flood high culture, and it is the task of the mythologist to uncover and decode these memories. In his books, West advances the theory that the pre-flood high culture was an Aryan civilization, and that its memories are preserved in the traditions of the ancient Egyptians, the Indo-Aryans, the Maya, and the Aztec. In his book on Atlantis, West states that the Atlantis myth is a memory of the Aryan migration from the flooding of the Indus Valley Civilisation. West has been described as a \"mythologist\" and as a \"leading figure in the study of the ancient world.\" His works have been reviewed in academic journals and he has been interviewed on radio and television programs.",
    " The Arcade Building is an historic commercial building located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 29–39 Queen Street West, on the south side of Queen Street, just east of Spadina Avenue. The building was designed by John M. Lyle in the Victorian Gothic style, and was built in 1892. The four-storey building is built of red brick with stone trim. The main facade is dominated by a three-storey arcade of Gothic arches, with the centre arch taller than the others. The arches are supported by clusters of colonettes. The building's original main entrance was through the central arch, but this has been closed up and a new entrance cut through the east wall of the building. The building's other main architectural features include the dormer windows on the fourth floor, and the two-storey polygonal bay window on the Spadina Avenue side of the building. The building was originally built for the Toronto Athletic Club, which had been founded in 1888 by a group of businessmen who wanted a club with a swimming pool and other sports facilities. In 1889, the club acquired the property at 29 Queen Street West, and commissioned the building from architect John M. Lyle, who had also designed the club's previous premises at 23 Mutual Street.

    " The 37th Army was a field army of the Soviet Union's Red Army, active from 1942 through to the early 1970s. The 37th Army was formed on November 7, 1942, from the 37th Army Corps. It was part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and was used for the 1943–44 offensive to recapture the Ukrainian SSR.

    " Apologeticus In Roman Catholic theology, apologetics is an area of the Christian tradition that deals with the defense of the Catholic faith. In Greek, the word apologeticus (ἀπολογικός) means \"speaking in defense\". The term apology in this context is not an admission of wrongdoing, but rather a defense of the faith. Apologetics includes the defense of the Catholic Church against scandals, the promotion of the Catholic faith through the explanation of church teachings and traditions, and the refutation of objections to Catholic teachings. It is an important topic for the Catholic Church, particularly in the face of a secularized culture. The Catholic Church's approach to apologetics is unique. While it makes use of reason, it does not rely upon it absolutely. Catholic apologetics is not an attempt to win an argument, but to win a soul. Thus, Catholic apologetics is more about love than about logic. The Church's approach to apologetics is to convince people of the love that God has for them, and the extent to which the Catholic Church wants to lead them to that love. In the modern world, the term apologetics has come to refer more to the use of reason to convince someone of the faith, rather than to the use of love. This is an unfortunate narrowing of the term's meaning, which has been further confused by the use of the term apologetics to refer to the defense of the faith against those who attack it. In this context, apologetics is not about love, but about winning an argument. This is not the meaning that the Church gives to the term apologetics. In the Catholic Church, the term apologetics is used to refer to the use of reason to explain and promote the faith. This is a very different use of the term apologetics than is generally used in the modern world.",

    " Clone, in computing, is a term for a copy of a file or a block-level representation of a file in another file, usually with the same name. Cloning is different from a backup, as a backup is a copy of a file with a different name. Cloning is used for the purpose of having two or more exact copies of a file or a data structure that can be modified independently of each other. Changes made to one copy will not affect the other copy. The concept of cloning is similar to that of a fork in software development. Cloning can be done manually or by using a cloning tool. A cloning tool may also be called a \"clone manager\" or a \"cloning application\". There are many reasons for cloning a file. One reason is to have a backup of the file. If the file is important, a clone can be made so that if the original file is lost or damaged, a clone can be used as a backup. Another reason for cloning a file is to have a copy of the file that can be modified without affecting the original file. For example, if a file is being worked on by two or more people, a clone can be made for each person so that they can each make changes to their own copy without affecting the changes made by the other person. Cloning can also be used to create a copy of a file that can be shared with others. For example, if a file is too large to email, a clone can be made and shared via a file-sharing service or a cloud storage service. There are some risks to using cloning. One risk is that if a clone is made of a file that is being worked on by another person, the changes made by the other person may not be reflected in the clone. This can lead to confusion and lost work. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that the clone is made of the most recent version of the file. Another risk is that if a clone is made of a file that is later deleted, the clone may not be able to be recovered. This is because the reference to the original file may be lost, and the clone may only contain a copy of the data from the file.",

    " The Plinian core is a layered, bulbous, and distinctively-shaped feature found within the Plinian eruption column of certain large explosive volcanic eruptions. It is a dramatic example of a controlled gravitational collapse of the eruption column, which is driven by the loss of stability when the magma chamber empties. The name is derived from Pliny the Younger, who described in his letters the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, and provided the first description of the phenomenon. The Plinian core is a result of the non-stop growth of the eruption column, and is distinct from the more common and shorter-lived volcanic bombs, which are sometimes also called \"plinian\". The eruption column grows when magma is fed to the base of the column, and the weight of the column increases. As the magma chamber empties, the column loses its support, and the weight of the eruption column causes a gravitational collapse. This in turn causes the magma to pool at the base of the column, and the cycle repeats itself. The result is a series of concentric zones within the eruption column, with the cool, brittle, and relatively empty zones near the top, and the warm, less-brittle, and more fluid zones near the bottom. When the Plinian core finally does burst, it releases a tremendous amount of energy, and the outermost zones of the Plinian core are blown away. The remaining Plinian core then collapses, and a base surge is created. The Plinian core has a large amount of potential energy, and when it is released, the energy can trigger further pyroclastic flows. Plinian cores can be very large, and they can have a volume of hundreds of cubic kilometers. They are also very long-lived, and they can survive for thousands of years. The famous Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 produced a plinian core that was 1,600 feet (488 m) long. The eruption of Mount Spurr in 1992 produced a plinian core that was 3,200 feet (980 m) long.

    " Suicide of Tyler Clementi The suicide of Tyler Clementi was the second-degree murder of college student Tyler Clementi, who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge on September 22, 2010. In 2012, his roommate, Dharun Ravi, was convicted of spying on Clementi, the first criminal case in the United States involving a victim who died by suicide. On the evening of September 20, 2010, Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, bid farewell to his friends and took his life by jumping off the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River. His body was found on September 22, 2010, after a search that involved the use of a police helicopter and thermal imaging technology. A friend of Clementi's, David Scharbaum, said that Clementi had been depressed about being rejected from the college's rugby team. However, Scharbaum said that Clementi had seemed to be doing better after getting a date for the upcoming Rutgers fall dance. Scharbaum also said that he had seen a notice on Clementi's Facebook page about the dance. \"I saw that he was excited about it,\" Scharbaum said. Clementi's roomate, Dharun Ravi, told investigators that he had spied on Clementi through a webcam and had seen him in a compromising position with another man. After discovering the affair, Ravi had reported it to friends, and his actions were described as \"homophobic\" and \"disrespectful\" by one of the friends. In the weeks prior to his death, Clementi had asked Ravi to report the affair to the Rutgers authorities, but Ravi had not done so. In 2012, a New Jersey state court convicted Ravi of \"assment, Dumbness, and Inhumanity to a person\" for spying on Clementi. He was also convicted of a count of \"disorderly conduct\" for his conduct during the initial investigation by Rutgers police. Ravi was sentenced to three years in prison. In September 2012, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Clementi as one of their \"10 Most speech-restricted colleges in the country\". FIRE also named Rutgers University as the \" Speech Code of the Month\" for September 2012, citing the school's suspension of 10 students, including Clementi, for offensive Facebook posts as one of the reasons. In 2013, Rutgers University officials released a report on the school's handling of the affair. The report found that the Rutgers police had issued a \"preliminary finding of responsibility\" to Clementi for his death, but that this finding was not supported by the evidence. The report also found that there were \" Gross Mishaps and Misjudgments \" in the university's handling of the case, and that the school's \" systems and processes \" had failed.",
    " Fundamental theorem of linear programming The fundamental theorem of linear programming is a basic result in linear programming that shows that any linear programming problem can be boiled down to a trivial problem. Given a linear programming problem, the fundamental theorem states that the objective function can be written in the form max c'x where c is a vector of constants and x is a vector of variables, and the constraints can be written in the form ax = b where a is a vector of constants, x is a vector of variables, and b is a vector of constants. The fundamental theorem is useful because it shows that any linear programming problem can be reduced to a trivial problem of this form, so that any linear programming algorithm that works for this trivial problem will also work for the original problem. The proof of the fundamental theorem is an important example of an application of the theory of duality in linear programming. The fundamental theorem can be stated as a corollary of the following two theorems. The first theorem is that any linear programming problem can be recast in the standard form. The second theorem is the so-called primal-dual theorem, which is a basic result in linear programming that shows that every linear programming problem can be recast as a primal-dual problem, where the primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem. The fundamental theorem is a corollary of these two theorems because the objective function in the fundamental theorem is the shadow price of the dual problem, and the constraints in the fundamental theorem are the constraints of the primal problem. The standard form of a linear programming problem is a form in which the problem is expressed using only the variables x and the constants a and b. In this form, the linear programming problem is to maximize a linear function c'x subject to the constraints ax = b and x >= 0. Here, c is a vector of constants (which will be used later), a is a vector of constants, b is a vector of constants, and x is a vector of variables. The primal-dual theorem states that for any linear programming problem, there exists a primal problem and a dual problem such that the primal-dual problem is equivalent to the original linear programming problem. The primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem. The primal-dual theorem is a basic result in linear programming that shows that every linear programming problem can be recast as a primal-dual problem, where the primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem. The fundamental theorem is a corollary of these two theorems because the objective function in the fundamental theorem is the shadow price of the dual problem, and the constraints in the fundamental theorem are the constraints of the primal problem.",

    " German destroyer Z28 The German destroyer Z28 was a Type 1936A-class destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during World War II. The Type 1936A-class destroyers were a group of four destroyers ordered in 1936, and were the first destroyers designed and built specifically for Germany's Kriegsmarine. The four vessels of the class, from the smallest to the largest, were the Z23, Z24, Z25, and Z28, all of which entered service in early 1939. These ships were larger and more powerful than the preceding Type 1934 and Type 1936 classes, with increased engine power and heavier anti-aircraft guns. Unlike the older classes, whose engines were arranged in separate engine rooms, the Type 1936A class was built with two exhaustible Chance Vought steam turbines in a single engine room. The destroyers were well-armed for their time, with a five-inch (130 mm) dual purpose gun, three anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. The Z28 was laid down in October 1937 at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Kiel, Germany. She was commissioned on 3 January 1939 with Kapitän zur See (KzS—Kapitan zur See, \"Captain at Sea\") Alfred Schikin in command. After serving as a flotilla leader in the 1st Torpedoboat Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo-Boat Group, in October 1944, Z28 was assigned to the 2nd Torpedoboat Flotilla of the 3rd Torpedo-Boat Group. On 18 December 1944, the Z28 was sunk by British bombers in the IJsselmeer.",
    " Mount Druitt railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Western line in Mount Druitt, New South Wales, Australia. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station is located 72 kilometres (45 mi) from Sydney Central station. The station was built in 1884 and is the second station to have been built on this site. The original station was a simple bog standard design, however in the early 20th century it was decided that the station needed to be upgraded to a more substantial design. The station was subsequently rebuilt in concrete with a barrel roofed platform shelter and a distinctive and unique signal box, which is one of the few to have been built in that style in the state. The station was closed in 1991 due to the construction of the Mount Druitt Hospital and the subsequent rerouting of the Main Western line. The station was then subsequently rebuilt in 1998 to the same design as the original, with the signal box being relocated to Blacktown. The station is now the terminating point for the Blacktown-Mount Druitt via Richmond service.",

    " Ural Republic The Ural Republic (in Russian: Урал Республики) was a short-lived republic within the Russian SFSR, which existed in December 1918 through March 1922. Its capital was briefly based in Ekaterinburg, but was eventually moved to longitudinal position 51° 35' 14\" north, the same as the modern-day Ural Republic. The idea of a separate Ural state appeared in the early 20th century, when the Urals region began to be more heavily populated and industrialize. The region's rich mineral resources, including deposits of oil, natural gas, coal, and metals, promised the region great prosperity. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Ural region was part of the Siberian Republic, which was merged into the RSFSR in late 1917. In May 1918, the Siberian Republic was reestablished as a separate entity within the RSFSR. The Ural region was given special status within the Siberian Republic, with the right to its own legislative and executive bodies. In September 1918, the Siberian Republic was again merged into the RSFSR. The next month, the Catherine II Region was established in the Ural region as a separate entity within the RSFSR. In December 1918, the Urals Republic was established, which included the Catherine II Region and the western part of the Tobolsk Region, which was later incorporated into the RSFSR from Siberia. In March 1919, the Perm Territory was transferred from Siberia to the Urals Republic. In June 1919, the Siberian Republic was again separated from the RSFSR, and in November 1919, it was re-merged into the RSFSR. After that, the Urals Republic remained the only separate federal subject within the RSFSR, until its disestablishment in March 1922. On December 12, 1918, the First All-Ural Congress of Soviets was held in Ekaterinburg, where the Constitution of the Urals Republic was adopted. The congress elected a regional government, the Extraordinary Executive Committee, and a regional executive committee. Alexander Beloborodov was elected chairman of the Extraordinary Executive Committee. The Extraordinary Executive Committee was responsible for the economic transformation of the region, while the regional executive committee was responsible for the political and military administration. In May 1919, the Second All-Ural Congress of Soviets was held in Ekaterinburg. The congress elected a new regional government, the Extraordinary Executive Committee, and a regional executive committee. The new regional executive committee was headed by Alexander Beloborodov, who was also elected chairman of the Extraordinary Executive Committee.

    " Fourth Fitna The Fourth Fitna (Arabic: الفتنة الرابعة) or the Fourth Islamic Civil War was a period of political and religious conflict and turmoil that lasted from the death of Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 until the defeat and death of the last claimant to the caliphate, Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya, in 683. The conflict was primarily between the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruled by the Umayyad dynasty, and the various Iraqi rebel movements that sought to overthrow them. The Umayyad victory was an important step in the Umayyad consolidation of power, and in the process, the displacement of the political and religious center of the Caliphate from the Hejaz to Syria. The term fitna is commonly used to refer to the various civil wars that afflicted the Islamic community in the wake of the Prophet Muhammad's death. The first fitna lasted from 656 until 661, the second fitna lasted from 683 until 685, the third fitna lasted from 686 until 692, and the fourth fitna lasted from 661 until 683. The causes of the fourth fitna were similar to those of the second and third fitnas, with the major causes being the tension between the executive and legislative branches of government, the concentration of power in the hands of the caliph, the failure of the caliph to meet the expectations of the ruled, economic and social hardships imposed by the ruling regime, and the desire of the ruled to share in the ruling elite's privileges. The fourth fitna was characterized by the fragmentation of the opposition to the Umayyads. Whereas the opposition during the second and third fitnas was primarily regional, during the fourth fitna it became primarily tribal. The tribes of Banu Tamim, Banu Qahtan, and Banu Asad were the most active in the conflict. The fourth fitna also featured the first instance of widespread ideological opposition to the Umayyads, in the form of the Kharijites, who opposed the Umayyads' accommodations to the non-Muslims and the elite's privilege. The first phase of the fourth fitna began with the murder of the Umayyad caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 and the subsequent struggle for the caliphate between the Umayyads and the Iraqis. The second phase began in 681 when the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya II died and was succeeded by his brother, Yazid II. The third phase began in 683 with the death of Yazid II and the appointment of his son, Mu'awiya III, to the caliphate. The fourth phase began in 684 when the Umayyad caliph, Marwan I, died and was succeeded by his son, Abd al-Malik. The fifth and final phase began in 685 when the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, died and was succeeded by his son, Walid I.",
    " When God Writes Your Love Story Before I met my husband, I had a list of all the qualities I wanted in a man. I wanted him to be kind, funny, smart, tall, and good-looking, just to name a few. But I also wanted him to be a spiritual leader. I wanted him to be a man who would love God more than he loved me. I think that's a lot to ask of a guy. I'm not sure I would have been able to answer that description at 22. I was certainly not a spiritual leader at that point in my life. I'm not even sure I knew what that meant. Looking back, I can see now that I was asking for a man who was farther along in his spiritual journey than I was. I wanted a man who was closer to God than I was because I knew that if I was going to spend the rest of my life with a man, I wanted him to be a man who would lead me closer to God, not away from Him. So I think it's interesting that here I am, at 33, and I'm living my own love story that I wrote for myself when I was 22. The man I'm married to is kind, funny, smart, tall, good-looking, and he's a spiritual leader. I'm not talking about a spiritual leader in the sense that he's the pastor of a church or a Bible study leader. I'm talking about a man who is growing closer to God every day and who is leading his family closer to God. When I was 22, I didn't think I would find a man who was as spiritually mature as I was. But here I am, married to a man who is much farther along in his spiritual journey than I am. He challenges me to be a better Christian. He leads our family in prayers at dinner and he leads us in reading the Bible every day. In my love story, I didn't just marry a man, I married a spiritual leader who is helping me become a better woman of God. And the amazing thing is that I'm not the only one who is learning from my husband. My husband is learning from me, too. We are both growing closer to God together and it's amazing. So here's the thing: God is writing your love story, too. If you're not married, He's writing your story. If you are married, He's writing your story. Maybe you're not married to a spiritual leader. Maybe you're not married to a man who is challenging you to be a better Christian. But I can promise you this: God is writing your love story and He will give you the man who is right for you. If you're not married, don't settle for a man who is not growing closer to God. Don't settle for a man who doesn't make you a better Christian. And if you are married, don't settle for a man who is not growing closer to God. Don't settle for a man who doesn't make you a better Christian. Because here's the truth: God is writing your love story and He will give you the man who is right for you. When God writes your love story, it's going to be a story that challenges you to be a better Christian. It's going to be a story that helps you grow closer to God. It's not going to be a story that leads you away from God. It's not going to be a story that makes you less of a Christian. So don't settle for anything less than what God has for you. Because when God writes your love story, it's going to be a story that's worth reading.",

    " Arengo and Freedom The arengo (or arena) was an institution in the medieval period in the Italian peninsula, in the area corresponding to the current regions of Tuscany, Umbria, and Romagna. It had a central role in the political and judicial life of the communities that had it. It was a distinctive feature of the legal and political system of the Communes, in particular of the cities, in comparison to the manorial system. The arengo was an assembly of all the citizens (or some of them, depending on the city) who had the right to vote for the government of the city. In particular, they were summoned in order to elect the main officers of the city, to decide on laws, and to judge on judicial cases. The arengo had its own officers, the arengari, who had the task to summon the arengo, to preside it, and to register the decisions. In some cities, the arengo was summoned only in particular moments, usually to elect the main officers of the city, while in other cities it was summoned more often. In any case, the arengo had to meet at least once a year. In the arengo, the citizens had the freedom to speak and to vote for the candidates to the offices of the city or for the new laws. In the arengo, the citizens were free and equal, without any distinction. The arengo was not an innovation of the Communes. It had a long tradition in the free communities of the Italian peninsula, like the rural communities of the Romans, and it was preserved also by the Lombards after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the Barbarian invasions, the arengo was one of the few institutions that was preserved by the communities that survived the disasters. After the Communes became the ruling power in Italy, the arengo was one of the main institutions of the cities. During the communal age, the arengo was not only an institution to rule the city, but also an institution to which the people of the city could appeal to solve their problems. In the arengo, the citizens could bring their complaints and their requests, and ask for a solution to their problems. The arengo could decide on laws, it could elect officers, and it could also judge on judicial cases. The arengo was the only institution that could decide on laws, and on the choice of the officers of the city. The arengo was a very important institution for the freedom of the cities. Only the arengo could decide on laws, and only the arengo could elect the officers who ruled the city: the arengo was the institution that made the city free.",

    " Ethnodoxology is the study of the relationship between the Christian faith and the cultural forms that shape and express it. It is a portmanteau of the words \"ethnography\" and \"doxology\". The word \"ethnography\" is used in the anthropological sense of a description of the beliefs and practices of a particular culture, in this case, the Christian culture. \"Doxology\" refers to the beliefs and practices that are expressed in the cultural forms. In some ways, ethnodoxology can be seen as the study of \"what the church sings when it praises God in a particular language and culture\". The term was coined in 1964 by the Brazilian Catholic priest, composer, and musician Orlando distribution, who was the founder of the anthropological school of thinking about music in the Catholic Church that is known as \"ethnodoxology\". Orlando was an assistant to the famous Brazilian anthropologist Roberto da Matta, and, as a musician, he was influenced by the musicologist Jacques Ibert. Together with other Brazilian musicians, Orlando developed the field of study known today as \"ethnodoxology\", with a particular concern for the relationship between music, faith, and culture. ethnodoxology has also been strongly influenced by the Chicago school of musicology, whose concern for the relationship between social context and musical form is reflected in the work of scholars such as George List and Nelson Goodfellow. The basic concern of ethnodoxology is the relationship between music, faith, and culture. It is a branch of musicology, but with a particular focus on the relationship between musical forms and the cultural and religious context in which they are created and performed.",

    " Blue Hills Reservation The Blue Hills Reservation is a 7,000-acre (2,700 ha) reservation in the Boston Metro area, primarily in the city of Milton, Massachusetts, and the towns of Canton, Dedham, Milton, and Randolph. The reservation is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and is the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Park System of Massachusetts. The Blue Hills are a range of low, rocky hills in the upper Charles River Valley just south of Boston, Massachusetts. The hills are named for the blue-grey color of their rocky slopes, which is a result of the weathering of basaltic bedrock. The Blue Hills are not tall enough to be called mountains, and are in fact only a few hundred feet above sea level at their highest point. The hills are part of a larger geologic formation that includes the recycling of the igneous rock of the Boston Basin, and the soil is mostly made up of glacial till. The Blue Hills Reservation consists of a series of seven drumlins, or hills formed by glaciers during the last ice age. The hills are joined by two glacial spurs, or lateral moraines, that form the borders of the reservation. The Blue Hills Reservation is also home to several kettle ponds, including Tinkers Pond and Spectacle Pond, formed by the glaciers that once covered the region. The Blue Hills Reservation is a popular destination for outdoor recreation. The reservation's many hiking trails, which total over 125 miles (201 km), are used for hiking, walking, and running. Bicycling and horseback riding are also allowed on some trails. The Blue Hills are also a popular destination for rock climbing, with over 1,000 established climbing routes. The reservation's many ponds and lakes are used for swimming, boating, and fishing, and the numerous parks and overlooks are used for passive recreation. In 2009, the Blue Hills Reservation was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

The band had previously been signed to Indianapolis-based label Rowe Productions, which released their 2007 album, Miasma. In 2009, the band was signed to Metal Blade Records, and released their EP, Warped & Decayed, through the label. Nocturnal was the band's final album to feature founding guitarist Mike Hodgin, who amicably left the band in early 2012 to pursue other musical interests. In July 2011, Nocturnal was released as a limited-edition double vinyl album. The album was re-released in June 2012, following the band's signing to eOne Music.

    " Sparks are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1970 by brothers Ron (the lead guitarist, vocals, kazoo, piano,organ) and Russell Mael (the lead vocalist, keyboards, guitar, drums, percussion) with the intention of doing experimental pop music. The band's current line-up consists of the Mael brothers and drummer Steve Durand, with various bassists and programmers in rotation. Since the band's formation, they have released twenty studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles and music videos. The band came to international attention in 1974 with the release of their second studio album, Kimono My House, which featured their first hit single, \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". The song was among the first to feature a disability-related theme, and it reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. The album's title track was also a hit, reaching the top ten in the United States and Canada. The band's next album, Big Beat (1976), featured two more UK top ten hits, \"Never Turn Your Back on a Friend\" and \"Get Crazy\". Their 1978 album, This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us, was their first UK number one. It featured their only UK number one single, \"The Number One Song in Heaven\", and \"Tryouts for the Human Race\", which was the first of their songs to hit the Billboard Hot 100. In the early 1980s, the band's popularity began to wane. They changed their style and became more experimental to catch the interest of the audience. Their 1983 album, Kimono Wars, was a critical and commercial failure. A new direction in 1984 with the release of the album, Music That You Can Dance To, did not lead to a commercial recovery. A series of collaborations with other artists, including \"I Predict (We'll Be Famous)\", with Annie Lennox, helped to keep the band in the public eye. In 1986, the band's contract with Columbia Records expired and they signed with Virgin Records. They began to work on what would become their first major hit album in eight years, Whomp That Sucker. The title track was released as a single and became their biggest hit in the United States since \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". The next year, they had another hit with \"Angst in My Pants\", from the album Luxury Problem. In 1989, they released the album, The Whomp That Sucker Tour, a live album with a studio recording of \"Let's Go to Bed\", which was their final hit. In the early 1990s, the band's popularity began to wane again. They released the album, Angst in My Pants, but it failed to chart. In 1996, they released a greatest hits album, and they have not had a hit since. In 2001, the band released a new album, Lil' Beethoven. They continue to perform and tour, and have released several live albums.",

    " Someone to Watch Over Me (TV series) Some to Watch Over Me is a British television drama series, produced by the BBC and transmitted on BBC One from 28 September 1998 to 1 May 2002, although the final episode was postponed due to the death of Princess Margaret. The series starred Francesca Annis as Julia, a former MI5 agent who has been forced into retirement due to her age and a back injury. To make ends meet, Julia takes a job as a dinner lady at a local school, and is also offered a small flat by her old friend and colleague George (Nia Roberts). Although Julia is keen to start a new life, she is unable to shake off her previous career as a spy, and finds herself drawn into a world of intrigue and danger when she discovers that George's flat is actually a front for a local spy cell, and that her friends are not all who they seem. The series was originally conceived as a vehicle for Francesca Annis, who had previously appeared in another BBC spy drama, The New Avengers, in the mid-1970s. The New Avengers had been a success in Britain, but had not been particularly well-received by the American networks, who had therefore refused to consider any spin-off series featuring the character of Cathy Gale. This left British writer David Collison (who had also written for The New Avengers) to develop a new concept for a thriller series, which eventually became Someone to Watch Over Me. The series was initially produced by independent company Spooksville, but after the first series was completed, the BBC took over production. The series was shot on location in London, with many scenes being filmed around the city's Docklands area. Someone to Watch Over Me was not a major critical success, but it did gain a small cult following, and the first series was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States. The series was also screened on cable channel Bravo. A novelisation of the series, written by Barry Vanes, was published by BBC Books in 1999.",

    " Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-1943 In World War II the North Atlantic was the scene of a struggle between the German Kriegsmarine and the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. The German effort was to transport men and material to Europe from 1939 to 1943. The Allies' effort was to prevent this. The area of conflict was the North Atlantic Ocean, which stretches from the coast of North America to that of Europe. The fighting took the form of a naval war, a war fought by aircraft and ships, with the conflict lasting from September 1939 until May 1945. The North Atlantic was the key area for the supply of war materials to the European theatre. The majority of the shipping used in the Atlantic supply convoys came from the United States and Canada. In the early part of the war, the Germans had a decisive victory in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. This, coupled with the invasion of Norway, gave them control of the North Atlantic for several months in 1940. In 1941, the Germans attacked the United States through their occupation of Denmark and Norway, which gave them control of the North Atlantic sea lines of communication. This, in turn, threatened the flow of supplies to the Soviet Union, Britain, and the Mediterranean. The United States and Britain went on the offensive in the North Atlantic, and by the end of 1941 had defeated the German effort to control the North Atlantic sea lines of communication. The Battle of the North Atlantic was a major factor in the defeat of Germany in World War II. The U-boat campaign in the Atlantic was one of the longest and most bitterly fought campaigns of World War II, and it is often described as the \"Second Trafalgar\" in reference to the First Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in 1805 that had dealt a crushing blow to Napoleon's campaign against the British Empire. In this second Trafalgar, the Allies won a victory so decisive that the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) was never again able to pose a serious threat to the sea lines of communication between the New World and the Old World. In the first two years of the war, the German U-boats and the Royal Navy and the United States Navy were locked in a deadly war of cat-and-mouse in the North Atlantic. The Germans enjoyed a period of success in this campaign in the early months of the war, but the Allies gradually gained the upper hand, and by the end of 1941 they had won a clear victory. In the spring of 1943, the Germans launched a major offensive in the North Atlantic, with the aim of breaking the sea lines of communication between the United States and Britain. This offensive, known as \"Operation Drumbeat\", was the largest U-boat campaign of the war, and it resulted in a major defeat for the Allies. However, the Allies were able to recover from this defeat, and by the end of the year they had once again gained the upper hand in the North Atlantic. In the final two years of the war, the Allies carried on a relentless offensive in the North Atlantic, with the aim of completely destroying the German U-boat force. This offensive, coupled with the defeat of the German surface fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic, led to the complete destruction of the German economy, and the surrender of Germany in May 1945.",

    " RAF Dalton RAF Dalton was a Royal Air Force station in West Yorkshire, England, located 2.4 miles (3.9 km) west of Huddersfield, just off the A640 road and close to the village of Kirkheaton. The RAF station was opened in the late 1930s as a bomber base, with the first aircraft arriving in January 1939, just before the outbreak of war. It became the home of No. 1 Group, Royal Air Force, and its resident aircraft were a mixture of Wellington, Halifax and Lancaster bombers, and the odd Mustang fighter. During the war, the bombers of No. 1 Group were used to attack enemy industries, communications, and transport in Germany, Italy, and occupied Europe. No. 1 Group was one of the few Groups to have a permanent base in Yorkshire. During the war, the Group consisted of four squadrons (No's. 101, 102, 103, and 104), and four bombing schools (No's. 1, 4, 5, and 11). The Group was equipped with a wide range of aircraft, and during the war it operated Wellingtons, Halifaxes, Lancasters, Mustangs, and Mosquitos. Dalton was one of the few RAF stations to have an all-female ground crew. They were part of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, or WAAF. No. 1 Group was the first to be equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito. These were used for fast, low-level, daylight operations, particularly at the start of the war when the German industries were the main target. As the war progressed and the German night-time defences became more effective, the Mosquito was used for night-time operations. The station was also used by No. 4 Group, Royal Air Force, and No. 627 Squadron, Royal Air Force, as well as a number of other units. In November 1947, the station closed. The site is now the location of the Huddersfield Golf Club.",

He is the former Superintendent of Durant Public Schools and a former principal of Durant High School. In 2004, he was named Oklahoma's Superintendent of the Year. In 2010, he was elected governor, defeating incumbent Democratic governor Brad Henry by 3,111 votes. He was sworn in as governor on January 2, 2011. In November 2010, Oklahoma County District Judge Donald Nightengale issued an injunction preventing Sparks from taking office as governor until a lawsuit could be heard regarding whether Sparks was qualified to serve. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that Sparks did not meet the requirements to serve as governor because he had not been a resident of Oklahoma for at least 10 years prior to his election, as required by the Oklahoma Constitution. As a result, Henry was allowed to serve the remainder of his term, and Sparks's term was shortened by approximately five months. Sparks's term as governor ended on January 10, 2011. The Oklahoma Constitution limits governors to two consecutive terms, so he was not eligible to run for governor again in 2014.",

    " Jean Langlais, in religion Brother Polycarp, (born in Briançon, Hautes-Alpes, 19 February 1907 – died in Paris, 4 June 1988) was a French Catholic priest, composer, and concert pianist. After a short stint as a pupil of Gabriel Grovlez at the Conservatoire de Paris, Langlais studied with Paul Le Flem at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, where he was introduced to the music of the Baroque masters and to that of his contemporaries. His technical command of the piano and his flair for melody, which characterized his playing throughout his life, were already evident at this time. In 1932, together with the composer Jacques Ibert, the singer Pierre Pflueger, and the actor Georges Pitoëff, he founded the \"Congregation des Arts et des Lettres\", a society which held monthly concerts at the \"Théâtre des Arts\" in Paris, and which had its seat in the famous \"Hôtel Lambert\" on the Ile Saint-Louis. In the following year he was ordained a Catholic priest and took the name of Brother Polycarp. In the course of a long career, Langlais performed in public more than 2000 times, playing mainly in Europe, but also in Asia and in Latin America. His repertoire was vast, extending from 16th-century masters to contemporary composers. As a performer, he was best known for his interpretations of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Liszt. In addition to his playing, he was also active as a teacher, as a conductor, and as an editor. In the early 1930s, together with the musicologist Eaglefield Hull, he edited the complete piano sonatas of Beethoven. In the following decade he made a complete recording of the Beethoven sonatas, which has been recently re-issued on CD. In 1954 he began a long association with the Japanese pianist and composer Kazuhito Kohjiro Kawai, who was his exclusive Asian manager and with whom he closely collaborated in the development of the Kawai piano. In the same year he recorded most of the piano works of Liszt, including the transcription of the nine symphonies of Beethoven, for the Japanese label King Records. In the following years he gave numerous concerts in Japan, where he was awarded the \"Grand Prix International des Discjockeys\" in 1965. In the late 1970s, together with the composer Jean Barraqué, he was one of the founders of the \"Association pour l'encouragement de la composition musicale\". In 1980 he was appointed \"Commandeur de la légion d'honneur\" by the French Government. After his death, many of his former pupils and other musicians paid tribute to him. The pianist Charles Rosen, who had studied with him as a teenager, wrote: \"He was a priest, but he was also a superb musician, one of the most refined and elegant musicians I have ever heard. His playing was crystalline, and it had a sort of restrained passion that I have never heard equalled\". The conductor Seiji Ozawa, who was his neighbour in Paris and a close friend, said: \"He was not only a great musician, but also a great human being\". The pianist Homi Khasnavi, who studied with him at the Conservatoire de Paris, wrote in his liner notes to a recent CD edition of some of Langlais's recordings: \"The word 'genius' is over-used, but in the case of Jean Langlais, it is fully justified. Not only was he a brilliant pianist, but also a thinker and a visionary whose ideas and ideals are now carried on by his many students around the world\".",
    " Hibbard & Darrin was an American architectural firm that designed numerous iconic buildings, including the original San Francisco City Hall and the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Los Angeles. The firm was founded in 1908 by George W. Hibbard (1866–1938) and S. E. Darrin (1865–1930), who had both previously worked for Joseph A. Leonard, a Los Angeles-based architect. Hibbard & Darrin became known for their use of Renaissance Revival and Neoclassical styles, as well as their ability to blend various architectural styles in a single building. The firm designed numerous buildings in California, including the Downtown Los Angeles Public Library, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. They also designed buildings in other states, such as the Nevada State Capitol in Carson City, Nevada, and the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.

    " Inro (TagName) An inro is a Japanese accessory for holding small objects. Generally a small, round, flat box, traditionally made of metal, wood, or lacquered wood, the inro is worn suspended from the waist by a cord or chain. It is used for holding small objects that might be needed on short notice, such as money, keys, or tobacco. Using an inro is part of the traditional Japanese dress. Since traditional Japanese dress includes a kimono, which does not have pockets, objects that might be needed on short notice must be carried in a small bag or pouch. A full-size bag is not practical, as it would interfere with the kimono when walking. For this reason, a small, round, flat box called an inro is used. Inro were first used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as a substitute for the small sword, which was a required accessory for men. During this time, inro were often made of metal, and featured elaborate and artistic designs. They often featured a Netsuke, a small sculpture that served as a toggle for the cord or chain that was used to suspend the inro from the waist. After the Edo period, inro were mostly made of wood, and featured more simple and functional designs. Although inro were traditionally made of metal or wood, they are now often made of plastic. Inro are still used by some traditionalists, and are popular as collectors' items. They are often sold as souvenirs, and feature a wide variety of designs and materials.",
    " The Starfish and the Spider is a business book by Ralph Kimball and Joe Leppitt, published in 1998, discussing the management of data in a data warehouse. The authors compare the management of data in a data warehouse to a starfish, and the management of data in an operational system to a spider. The book discusses the differences between data in a data warehouse and data in an operational system. Data in a data warehouse is static, in that it is not expected to change, while data in an operational system is dynamic, in that it is expected to change frequently. Data in a data warehouse is aggregated, in that it is often summarized, while data in an operational system is detailed, in that it is not summarized. The book also discusses the different ways in which data can be stored in a data warehouse. Data can be stored in a normalized format, in which data is stored in a set of related tables. Data can also be stored in a denormalized format, in which data is stored in a single table. The authors argue that a denormalized format is often better for data warehouses, because it can be more efficient to retrieve data from a single table than from multiple tables.",

The boundary between the two states was the 38th parallel. The first of these two states to be established was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in September 1948. The Republic of Korea was established in August 1948. After the partition, many Koreans were separated from their families and friends, and many Koreans were killed as they crossed the 38th parallel. The border between the two states is still heavily fortified, and remains the focus of many reunification efforts. Both states claim to be the sole legitimate government of Korea. The United States supported the south, while the Soviet Union supported the north. Both superpowers agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea in the future, but the United States did not immediately withdraw its troops, in case the Soviet Union invaded the south. The Soviet Union also did not withdraw its troops, because it wanted to see a friendly, pro-Soviet regime in the south. In 1950, the two states became involved in the Korean War. The United States supported the south, while the Soviet Union supported the north. The war ended in a stalemate, and the border between the two states was left unchanged. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea, and the two states have been separate ever since.",

A unique feature of the MG 60 is its \"built-in\" carry handle, which can be folded forward to serve as a cheekpiece or forward grip. The carrying handle also has a button that can be depressed to allow the handle to be rotated into a vertical position to serve as a buttstock. The firing rate is 650 rounds per minute, but the practical rate of fire is much lower. The belt of ammunition is inserted from either the left or right side. The magazine has a maximum capacity of 250 rounds. The MG 60 was designed for rapid fire in a single-shot or two-shot mode (the second shot being fired by the machine gun after a short delay once the first shot has been fired).

    " Polyarchy In political science, polyarchy (from the Greek: πολύς, poly (\"many\") and κράτος, kratos (\"power\")) is a form of government in which citizens exercise political power. Polyarchy is a broader concept than democracy, as it refers to the structure of the government and not to the method of voting. In a democracy, the government is run directly by the people who are voting for a specific candidate, party, or policy. In a polyarchy, the people elect representatives to create and vote on policies. Representative democracy is a form of polyarchy. Aristotle's Politics describes two forms of government: the state, or regime, and the constitution. The state is the ruling body, and the constitution is the legal basis for the state's existence. Constitution refers to the way in which the ruling body is organized, including the government's powers and the way that citizens are governed. For example, the United States Constitution provides for three branches of government—legislative, executive, and judicial—and provides ways for changing the constitution itself. In a polyarchy, the ruling body, or state, has multiple power centers. A pure form of polyarchy doesn't exist because all nations have a head of state who has more power than the other members of the ruling body. In the United States, for example, the president has more power than the speaker of the House or the majority leader of the Senate. Even so, the United States is a polyarchy, because the people elect multiple representatives who have some level of political power. Citizen participation in a polyarchy can take many forms: voting for representatives, joining a political party, or participating in interest groups that advocate for specific causes. In a polyarchy, the people are not always involved in the political process but can become involved by contacting their representatives, voting, or joining a political party or interest group.",

Zu was born in what is now the town of Kashiwazaki, Niigata, Japan. His real name was Utsunomiya no Michizane. He was a court poet in the Heian period (794–1185), and is famous for the \"tanka\" poetry form. His works appear in the anthology Shūi Wakashū. Zu was a priest at the temple of Joshokuji in Kashiwazaki. The temple was built by his father, who was a wealthy landowner, and was dedicated to Bodhisattva Fudo Myoo. In 794, Emperor Kanmu ordered the establishment of a system of provincial government. The provinces were divided into \"kokucho\" (provincial governments) and \"docho\" (sub-provincial governments). The governors and their deputies were appointed by the emperor. The \"docho\" were each headed by a \"doshi\", who was generally a local magnate. The most important \"docho\" was the \"Daitō\", which was the province in which the capital was located. The \"Daitō\" was further divided into \" fu\" and \"zoku\". The \"fu\" was the area within the city proper, while the \"zoku\" was the area outside the city. The \"doshi\" of the \"Daitō\" was the highest official in the province. He was generally a member of the \" bureaus\" and was appointed by the emperor. The \"doshi\" had many responsibilities, including tax collection, law enforcement, and military defense.

    " Sydney lockout laws The Sydney lockout laws are a set of liquor laws in New South Wales, Australia, that restrict the service of alcohol in the Sydney central business district (CBD). They were introduced in February 2014 by the O'Farrell government in response to a number of violent alcohol-related deaths in the previous year. The laws restrict alcohol sales in CBD hotels, clubs, and bars to no later than 1:30 am, and the service of alcohol in the same establishments to no later than 3:00 am. The laws also restrict the number of venue licences for new and existing venues in the CBD to no more than 10 per year, and the number of dance licences to no more than 5 per year. The laws also require the state's Liquor & Gaming NSW regulatory authority to publish a register of licensed venues in the CBD, including their trading hours and the number of approved dance licences. The laws were passed by the New South Wales Parliament in November 2013, and came into effect on 1 February 2014. They were supported by the New South Wales government and the New South Wales Police Force, but opposed by the Australian Hotels Association, the Australian Licensed Club Association, and the Nightclub & Liquor Bar Association. The laws were designed to reduce alcohol-related violence in the CBD, and to improve the safety of patrons and the general public. The state government argued that the laws were necessary to address the problem of \"alcohol-related violence, anti-social behaviour and abuse\" in the city, and that they would \"make Sydney a safer place for everyone\". The laws were also designed to protect the state's night-time economy, and to create a safer environment for the city's nightlife. The laws have been controversial, and have been opposed by many businesses and individuals in the hospitality industry, as well as by some community groups and individuals.

    " Unicase (also known as unicase, MixCase, mixed case, or casefolding) is the ability of some letter systems to write all letters, or certain letters, with either a lower or upper case letter. In most cases this refers to the ability to use either the upper or the lower case of the same letter. A unicase script is a writing system with a unicase base alphabet. Most writing systems are unicase, with notable exceptions including the Han script, Devanāgarī, and most abugidas. The basic Latin alphabet is unicase, as is the Greek alphabet. Cyrillic and the basic Hebrew alphabet are also unicase. Most letters in the unicase scripts are displayed in upper case in all caps settings, and lower case in lower case settings. However, some letters in unicase scripts are not Capitalized in all caps settings, such as the soft-gamma in Cyrillic, Ẽ in the Latin alphabet, and Ạ in the Greek alphabet. In some unicase scripts, notably the Arabic and Hebrew scripts, some letters (or all letters) have distinct shapes for upper and lower case, but are never joined with a superior diacritic to create a single letter. The Arabic and Hebrew scripts are referred to as \"semicased\" rather than unicase in this context. The term \"unicase\" was coined in 1969 by Peter R. Jones to describe the behavior of letters in the Latin and Greek alphabets. The term is sometimes confused with \"lowercase\", \"upper case\", or \"case sensitive\". A unicase alphabet is an alphabet that includes at most one letter for each sound, and whose letters are normally written in only one case. A unicase letter is a letter that can be represented by at most one character in a given alphabet. A unicase script is a script that uses only unicase letters, or that can be represented entirely by unicase letters from some alphabet. A unicase writing system is a writing system that uses only unicase letters, or that can be represented entirely by unicase letters from some alphabet. A unicase font is a font that includes only unicase letters. A unicase encoding is an encoding that maps letters to the same byte value in both the upper and lower case. A unicase keyboard is a keyboard that produces only unicase letters. A unicase character is a character that has the same form for both upper and lower case. A unicase word is a word that is formed from unicase letters only. A unicase text is a text that contains only unicase words.",

The park is bounded on the west by the Rideau Canal. It was named for the former Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In the early 20th century, the site was the location of several large weigh scales used by the Canadian Pacific Railway to weigh trains passing through Ottawa. The large concrete platforms on which the scales rested remain to this day and are used as a stage for concerts and plays. The park was created in the 1930s, with the assistance of the Federal District Commission (now the National Capital Commission). The Commission had the land expropriated from the Canadian Pacific Railway and then gave it to the City of Ottawa. The park has been the subject of a number of development proposals. In the early 1970s, the City of Ottawa proposed to build a new city hall on the site, as well as a new central library, and an expansion of the National Gallery of Canada.

The Villanovan culture emerged from the earlier Final Bronze Age (1300–1100 BC), as a result of the invasion of the peninsula by the Sea Peoples and the subsequent collapse of several Mycenaean-like centres in southern Italy. The Villanovan culture was part of the Tyrrhenian cultural horizon, which also included the contemporary cultures of the Etruscans, the Celtic Hallstatt culture, and the Greek colonial world of Magna Graecia. The Villanovan culture is distinguished from the preceding and contemporary Italian cultures by a number of characteristics, such as: - Use of cremation - dominance of tombs - good quality pottery - the presence of weapons - the absence of imported luxury goods The characteristic handmade pottery of the Villanovan culture was made from local clays, and often featured a red slip. The remains of the Villanovan culture have been found in many parts of Italy, especially in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League), in the Po Valley, in Campania, in Basilicata, and in Sicily. In the 9th century BC, the Villanovan culture was succeeded by the Etruscan civilization, which developed in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League) and in the Po Valley. In the 6th century BC, the Etruscan civilization was in turn succeeded by the Roman Republic. The Villanovan culture is the basis for the modern Western alphabet, which is based on the Etruscan letters, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western alphabet. The Villanovan culture is also the basis for the modern Western calendar, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western calendar. The Villanovan culture was a significant influence on the later Etruscan civilization, which developed in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League) and in the Po Valley. The Etruscan civilization was in turn a significant influence on the later Roman Republic, which developed in the area of Etruria and in the Po Valley.",

    " The Art Genome Project The Art Genome Project is a project and ongoing research initiative of the Art.com Group, Inc. launched in February 2008. The project is designed to create a comprehensive database of art history based on the analysis of art works. The Art Genome Project uses a complex set of algorithms and taxonomies to organize, analyze, and interpret art works and their relationships with other art works. The project is based on the idea that all art works are a combination of artistic genes, based on their creator, subject, style, and other attributes. These genes combine in different ways to create art works. The Art Genome Project's database contains over 100,000 art works and over 1,000,000 genes. The Art Genome Project uses the concept of a \"genome\" as a means to organize and categorize art. The word genome is a blend of the Greek gene, which means \"origin,\" and the Latin genoma, which means \"model.\" The genome is a set of instructions, or a map, for the growth and development of a living organism. In the same way, the Art Genome Project's database is a set of instructions, or a map, for the growth and development of art. The Art Genome Project is intended to be a tool for the study and understanding of art. It can be used to trace the development of art styles and to identify relationships between art works that may not be immediately apparent. The project can also be used to predict the appeal of art works and to identify potential collectors.",

    " Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay, PC, QC, LLD, DL (13 August 1851 – 9 February 1929) was a Scottish lawyer, judge, and politician. He was the first Scottish advocate to become a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and the first to hold the office of Lord Chancellor of Great Britain and Ireland. Finlay was born in Edinburgh, the son of the physician and scientific writer John Finlay (1799–1869) and his wife, Elizabeth (1807–1897), daughter of Robert Smith, a prosperous Edinburgh businessman. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Edinburgh High School, and University of Edinburgh, where he won the Vans Agnew Medal and the Senior Medal in forensic medicine. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class degree in classics and a second class degree in law. He was called to the bar in 1876 and built up a large practice in Scotland, specialising in medical law. In 1901 he was made a Queen's Counsel and in 1908 a silk. He was an outstanding lawyer and his services were in great demand. He was asked by the Home Office to draft the bill which became the Sea Fisheries (Conservation of Stocks) Act 1902, and he advised the government on the Workmen's Compensation Act 1906 and the National Insurance Act 1911. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law of 1909–1910, and of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of Drugs and poisonous Chemicals, 1912–1915. In 1913 he became a member of the Committee on the Unauthorised Practice of Medicine, and in 1916 he was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee on Child Labour. He was also a member of the International Commission of Lawyers appointed to inquire into the methods of settlement of international disputes. In 1908 he became a member of the Faculty of Advocates' Committee on the Law of Medicine and in 1912 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1919 he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. Two years later, in 1921, he was appointed Lord Chancellor, in which office he served until his death. In 1922 he was made a life peer as Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and in 1927 he was further honoured when he was made a Viscount, entitling him to sit in the House of Lords as Lord Finlay. Lord Finlay was an excellent public speaker and a sound lawyer, but his appointment as Lord Chancellor was politically motivated, and he was not regarded by his contemporaries as a great lawyer. His tenure of the office of Lord Chancellor was not marked by any important legislation, and he is best remembered for his work in connection with the development of the law relating to medical negligence. In 1925, in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, he gave the first decision in a test case which was to become a landmark in the development of the law of negligence. He also gave the decision in the case of Allen v Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Ltd [1927] AC 696, in which it was held that the employer of a workman is not liable for an injury sustained by the workman due to the negligence of a fellow workman. Lord Finlay was a member of the Roxburghe Club and the Selborne Society. He was also a member of the council of the Scottish History Society and a vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was a keen golfer and a member of the St. Andrews Golf Club and of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. Lord Finlay married twice, first in 1880 to Jessie, daughter of David Smith of Aberdeen, by whom he had one son and one daughter, and, after her death in 1917, to Annie, daughter of Thomas Millie of Aberdeen, by whom he had one son and one daughter. He died in London on 9 February 1929, aged 77, and was succeeded in his titles by his elder son from his first marriage, John, who became a distinguished lawyer and judge in his own right. His second son, Robert, became a general in the Royal Air Force. His daughter from his first marriage, Janet, married the statistician and golfer Sir Henry Cotton. A collection of his speeches and essays was published in 1930, and a biography, by Sir WilliamWedgwood Benn, in 1931.",

    " Disruptive selection, in evolutionary biology, is a form of selection in which the fitness of one sex is much higher than that of the other, driving the population toward a unisex state. Disruptive selection occurs when the sex ratio is uneven, causing a deviation from the expected sex ratio, which is 50 percent male and 50 percent female. The sex ratio is the proportion of one sex to the other in a population. In disruptive selection, the actual sex ratio does not stay constant. Instead, the ratio oscillates between two levels. The population's gender composition shifts over time from one extreme to the other and then back again. In a population with even numbers of males and females, the gender composition should stay the same from one generation to the next. In a population with disruptive selection, the gender composition changes every generation. In the first generation, the ratio may be 60 percent male and 40 percent female. In the next generation, the ratio may shift to 70 percent male and 30 percent female. In the third generation, the ratio may be 80 percent male and 20 percent female. This pattern of shifting back and forth between two levels continues in subsequent generations. The cause of disruptive selection is usually a combination of a preference for one sex over the other and a shortage of the preferred sex. For example, in a population of birds, the females may prefer to mate with the males who have the brightest plumage. If there are not enough brightly colored males to go around, the females may be forced to mate with males who have duller plumage. Over time, this can cause the population to become more and more male-heavy, as the females prefer the males who are the most colorful and the males with the least colorful plumage have the highest fitness.",
    " Rachel is the name of several fictional characters in the Bible. Rachel (Hebrew: רָחֵל, lit. \"ewe\"), according to the Book of Genesis, was the wife of Jacob and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, and the daughter of Laban and Leah. According to the Bible, she was born in Paddan-Aram (now Northwest Syria) in the region of Upper Mesopotamia. The Midrash says that she was the daughter of Laban's chief servant, Zilpah. The narrative in Genesis does not explicitly refer to Rachel as Jacob's wife, only as \"Laban's daughter\". The Bible states that she was beautiful, modest, and kind, although it does not explicitly use the word \"beautiful\". She was a niece of Laban, and married her first cousin, Jacob. According to the Book of Genesis, Jacob loved Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in order to marry her. It also states that on the wedding night, Jacob impulsively consummated the marriage without waiting for the week-long wedding feast to finish. This resulted in Rachel becoming pregnant with Joseph. When Laban found out, he forced Jacob to agree to another seven years of service for Rachel. Years later, after Joseph was born, Jacob took his family and possessions and fled from Laban's house to go to his own country. Rachel died on the journey to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem), about 20 miles (32 km) south of Jerusalem, and was buried in a cave in the city. According to the Bible, Rachel died after giving birth to Benjamin, her second son. Rachel is listed in the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament. In Matthew 1:2–3, she is listed as the mother of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus. In Luke 3:32–33, she is listed as the mother of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus and James. Rachel is a major character in the deuterocanonical books of the Bible, the Book of Tobit and the Book of Judith. In the former, she is the wife of Tobit, who is portrayed as a righteous man. She falls sick and, in the course of the narrative, dies. In the latter, she is the mother of Judith, a heroine who saves her people from destruction by the invading Holofernes. Rachel is also a character in the Quran, where she is called Rayhanah and is the wife of Isma'il, the son of Ibrahim (Abraham). She is said to have died during a trip to the Levant, and is buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs.",

    " Jurisdiction stripping is the legal term for the set of tactics in which a state reduces the sovereignty of another state. The state that is the victim of jurisdiction stripping is typically a small state, and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping is typically a large state. The term was coined by Robert Jackson in a 1981 article entitled \"The New UN Law of Self-Determination\". Jurisdiction stripping can take many forms. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may announce, for example, that it no longer recognizes the independence of the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's territory. Jurisdiction stripping is often accomplished by the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping by simply declaring that the victim state is no longer independent. The victim state may have a very small military force and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have a very large military force. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its large military force to occupy the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its large military force to occupy the victim state's territory. Once the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping has occupied the victim state or the victim state's territory, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's tax laws. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. There are many variations on jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may strip jurisdiction from another state with which it has a territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its own legal system to adjudicate the territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes involving the victim state. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to settle disputes over tax payments or other financial matters. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes over the victim state's natural resources. There are also many variations on the types of states that are guilty of jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not take over the victim state's government. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it uses its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws, but does not use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. The legal consequences of jurisdiction stripping can be severe. If a state strips another state of its sovereignty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's debts and liabilities. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's natural resources. In addition, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's international legal obligations. For example, if the victim state has signed onto an international treaty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of the treaty. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's relationships with other states. For example, if the victim state has diplomatic relations with other states, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of those relationships.",

    " Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots The Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots were a series of riots in the autumn of 1992 in the Rostock district of Lichtenhagen. The riots were the most serious in the post-war history of the GDR and contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the GDR. At the end of August 1992, a group of neo-Nazis started to attack ethnic minority groups in the area. The attacks were mainly directed at the houses of Vietnamese in the district of Lichtenhagen. The police did not take action, which led to further escalate the riots. On September 2, 1992, a Friday, the Zionskirche (Zion Church) in Lichtenhagen was set on fire by three young men. The church was a cult meeting point for the Neo-Nazis. The police arrested the three young men but released them the next day. On Sunday, September 6, 1992, a large crowd of Neo-Nazis demonstrated in front of the church.

    " Chamcook Lake is a lake in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It is located in the city of Saint John, roughly 4 kilometres (2 mi) west of the city's downtown core. The lake is a result of the creation of the St. John River, which was formed by the last ice age. Chamcook Lake is the location of the annual Interprovincial Regatta, which is held each year on the first Sunday of August. The regatta is attended by thousands of people each year, with participants from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. The lake is the site of the Chamcook Lake Lodge, a historic summer lodge built in 1929. The lodge was built in the same style as the better known and more expensive Algonquin Hotel in St. Andrews, NB. The Chamcook was built by a group of St. John business people as a more affordable alternative to the Algonquin. The lodge is now a condominium complex. In the summer of 2007, a local non-profit organization, the Chamcook Lake Protection Association, attempted to have the lake named one of Canada's Great Lakes. The lakes are a group of lakes, of which only five are not in Ontario. They are named for their large size, and are the largest lakes in their respective provinces. The criteria for being named a Great Lake is that a lake must be at least 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in area, or have a minimum of 100,000 cubic kilometres of water. Chamcook Lake is 0.54 square miles (1.4 square kilometres) in area, and has 1,213,370 cubic metres of water. Chamcook Lake was named for the chamcook plant (Zannichellia palustris), which grows in the lake.",

    " Conferences of the United Church of Christ The UCC is composed of settings from the smallest local churches to the largest national organizations. In between are several layers of larger-scale organization, including the conferences. The conferences are regional bodies of the UCC, consisting of all the churches in a given region. Each conference has a unique name and is led by a \"conference minister,\" who may or may not also be a pastor of one of the churches in the conference. The conferences cooperate with each other and the churches in their regions on many different levels. They have a strong tradition of working together to achieve goals that the individual churches could not accomplish on their own. One example is the establishment of new congregations. The conferences have funds set aside to help new churches get started, and they offer expertise and guidance to help new churches grow and become healthy, strong congregations. In addition to working with the churches in their regions, the conferences also maintain ties with the national setting of the UCC. The General Council is made up of delegates from the conferences, and the General Minister and President is chosen by the General Council. The conferences also have representation on the various agencies and boards of the UCC. The conferences are divided into five \"itions\" ( regions ), each of which has its own characteristics and personality. The Atlantic Conference includes all of the churches in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. It is the most diverse conference, with a wide variety of rural, urban, and suburban churches. It is also the most progressive conference, with a strong history of social action and outreach.

    " USS Albemarle (1863) The USS Albemarle was a single-turreted, iron-hulled, riverine monitor of the United States Navy, named for the Battle of Albemarle Sound during the American Civil War. The monitor's design was based on that of the USS Montauk, the first of the Monitor class to be laid down. Like the Montauk, the Albemarle was designed to operate in the shallower waters of the rivers and Sounds of the Carolinas, where the larger ocean-going monitors could not maneuver effectively. The Albemarle had a shallower draft than the Montauk, with a much lighter armament and a correspondingly lighter armor protection. The Albemarle was the first monitor to be equipped with a Hotchkiss revolving cannon. The Albemarle was laid down in 1862 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 22 January 1863; and commissioned on 4 February 1864, with Commander George S. Blake in command. The Albemarle's first assignment was to support the Navy's effort to take the city of Fort Fisher, which was the last major port open to the Confederacy on the Atlantic Ocean. The Albemarle arrived at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in mid-January 1865, after the first battle for Fort Fisher, and helped to bottle up the fort and reduce its supplies and effectiveness. The Albemarle was heavily involved in the second battle for Fort Fisher, on 15 January 1865, providing fire support for the naval attack. The Albemarle was hit multiple times by Confederate artillery, but suffered no casualties or serious damage. After the second battle, the Albemarle, along with most of the other Union monitors, was sent to the James River in Virginia to support the final assault on the city of Richmond. The Albemarle arrived in the James River in early April 1865, just before the Lee's army evacuated the city. The Albemarle was one of the first Union warships to enter the city, and helped to accept the surrender of the city from Confederate authorities. The Albemarle was involved in the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, providing assistance to the Montauk, which had been ordered to transport the body of Lincoln to the capital. The Albemarle was decommissioned in May 1865, and placed in the James River reserve fleet. The Albemarle was never reactivated, and was eventually sunk to be used as a breakwater in the Delaware River in the 1870s.",
    " Choanephora cucurbitarum is a species of fungus in the family Choanephoraceae. It is a plant pathogen that causes the disease powdery mildew of pumpkin. The fungus was first described by the British mycologist E.F. Corner in 1952. The sexual stage was unknown until a teleomorphic stage was discovered in 2008. The fungus is a worldwide pathogen of pumpkins and squashes. It also occurs on cucumber, luffa, and other cucurbits. Infection causes severe losses in quality and quantity of yield. The disease is difficult to control, as the pathogen can survive for long periods of time in the soil or on infected plant debris. The spores are spread by wind or by contaminated soil or tools. A powdery white mycelium grows on the surface of the infected plant. The mycelium often has a greyish cast due to the presence of conidia. The conidia are single-celled, and are not encapsulated. They are lens-shaped, and are 3–5 μm wide and 2–3 μm long. The fungus is listed as a quarantine pathogen in the United States.",

    " 2013 Rayong oil spill In June 2013, a pipeline carrying oil from the Kuwait Export Crude Oil Pipeline to the Laem Chabang Port in Thailand burst, resulting in an oil spillage of up to 80,000 litres (18,000 US gal). The oil spread along the coast of Rayong Province, and affected the beaches of Rayong, Pattaya, and Sattahip. The spill also affected the area's marine and fishing industries. The pipeline is owned by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), and the oil was destined for the Laem Chabang Port, the principal port for Bangkok. The pipeline was inspected in 2012, and was found to be in good condition. The cause of the spill is under investigation, but the damage is estimated to be US$62 million. The oil spill affected over 100 kilometres (62 mi) of coastline, with the oil spreading over the water and onto the beaches. The spill was most severe on the beaches of Rayong, where the oil had reached a depth of 2 kilometres (1.2 mi). On 25 June 2013, the Thai government declared the oil spill to be a disaster, and announced that the KPC would be required to provide THB1.6 billion (US$50 million) in compensation. The Thai government also requested that the KPC provide a further THB1.6 billion for environmental and marine rehabilitation. The KPC has accepted responsibility for the spill, and has pledged to clean up the spill, and to provide assistance to the affected areas. The company has also agreed to pay THB2 billion (US$60 million) in compensation to the Thai government.",
    " A gateway station is a station where a transit service changes from one mode to another mode. The change may be from a subway, light rail, or bus rapid transit line to a bus, or vice versa. The change may also be from one subway, light rail, or bus rapid transit line to another subway, light rail, or bus rapid transit line. A gateway station is usually a major node in a transit system, and may be a major destination in its own right. The term is particularly used for stations in systems where one or more of the modes is not grade-separated, and thus the transfer involves going to a different location. In some cases, the different location is on the other side of a highway or other major barrier. A gateway station is often the hub of a transit network, where multiple routes converge. In many cases, the station is integrated with a large parking garage, allowing park-and-ride. In other cases, it is integrated with a transit-oriented development. The term gateway station is mainly used in the United States and Canada. In the UK, the term is mainly used for stations at the outer end of a rail branch line, where the line meets the main line. The first usage of the term \"gateway\" in a transportation context may be from the 1940s. It referred to the gateway stations of the New York City Subway, where the subway changed from one line to another. The term was used in a June 1948 article about the New York City Subway in The New York Times, and in a September 1948 article about the Washington, D.C. Metro. In British usage, the term gateway station is used for a station at the outer end of a rail branch line, where the line meets the main line. In Canadian usage, the term is used in a similar way to the American usage. In a January 2013 article about the new Metrolinx transit hub in Toronto, the term \"gateway station\" was used to refer to the existing GO Transit stations at Union Station and Exhibition Place. In July 2015, Metrolinx applied the term \"gateway station\" to the new Mount Dennis Station on the Kitchener line. In American usage, the term is used for a station where one mode changes to another mode. In some cases, it is used for a station where a line changes from one mode to another mode. In other cases, it is used for a station where a route changes from one mode to another mode. In some cases, the change may be from a subway, light rail, or bus rapid transit line to a bus, or vice versa.

    " Alexander Nisbet (1639–1721) was a Scottish herald and antiquary, best known for his work on the history of the Scottish tartan. Nisbet was born in Aberdeen, and lived there for much of his life. He was employed as an officer of arms at the Scottish College of Arms in Edinburgh from 1681 to 1704, and was also a collector of historical documents and a writer on genealogical topics. His best known work is the Scottish Tartans, which was published in 1704. This work includes a description of the tartan patterns used by the Highland clans, and is the first published work on the subject. It also includes a description of the heraldic symbols used by the clans, and a discussion of the history of the clans and their chiefs. Nisbet's work was well received at the time, and was used as a reference for later works on the subject. It was revised and expanded by later writers, and has been reprinted several times since it was first published. However, it has also been criticized for being incomplete and inaccurate, and for being based on a limited range of sources.",
    " In geometry, a facet is a flat surface of a polyhedron. The word is from the Latin root facere, \"to make\". A polyhedron is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces. The faces are usually regular shapes, such as triangles, squares, or hexagons. A polyhedron is named by the number of faces it has. For example, a polyhedron with three faces is a triangle, one with four faces is a square, and one with eight faces is an octagon. In addition to the faces, a polyhedron has edges and vertices. The place where three edges meet is a vertex. The faces of a polyhedron can be classified by their location on the polyhedron. If a face is a vertex, it is called a vertex face. If a face is an edge, it is called an edge face. The rest of the faces are called face faces. A polyhedron can be named by the number of faces it has. It can also be named by the number of vertices, edges, or faces. For example, a square is a polyhedron with four faces, but it also has four vertices and four edges. Facets are flat surfaces that make up the faces of a polyhedron. A facet is the same as a face, so a polyhedron can also be named by the number of facets it has. For example, a cube has eight facets, and a dodecahedron has twenty facets. The shape of a polyhedron is the shape of the facets. For example, a cube is a polyhedron with eight facets, and the shape of the facets is a square.",

    " Edwin Joseph O'Malley (December 7, 1882 – August 11, 1952) was an American politician and businessman from the state of Montana, best known for serving as the 22nd Governor of Montana from 1930 to 1932. O'Malley was born in Belt, Montana in 1882, the son of Irish immigrants. He attended the University of Montana and graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1904. In 1908 he married and had three children with his wife Elizabeth. After graduation, he went into the banking business and also became involved in local politics in his home town of Belt. In 1928, O'Malley was elected to the Montana House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term. In 1930, he was elected governor, defeating incumbent John E. Erickson by a margin of 3,343 votes. At the time, Montana Republicans were divided between the \"Standpatters,\" who opposed economic reform and supported the status quo, and the \"New Elephants,\" who supported reform and favored a more active role for the state government. The Standpatters dominated the party's nomination process, and O'Malley was nominated over the New Elephants' candidate, former state senator Charles H. Morrill. As governor, O'Malley had to deal with the effects of the Great Depression, which had a major impact on Montana's economy. The state's revenues declined dramatically, and O'Malley was forced to make significant budget cuts. He also had to deal with a number of strikes and labor disputes, including a major coal strike that lasted for several months. In addition, O'Malley was instrumental in the founding of the Montana Highway Patrol, the state's first organized law enforcement agency.

    " Winter's Tale (novel) Winter's Tale is a novel by Mark Helprin, published in 1983 by Jonathan Cape, London. The novel was a literary success, receiving positive reviews and becoming a best seller in the United States. Winter's Tale is set in New York City, mainly in the years between 1960 and 1990. It tells the story of a half-wild \"foundling\" boy, Peter Lake, who is taken in by a poor family in the South Bronx. The family is squatting in an abandoned apartment of a large, empty building, and Peter is told that he is the son of the building's owner. When the building is sold, Peter is forced to live with his wealthy relatives, the Colemans, in their apartment on Park Avenue. As an adult, Peter becomes a successful Wall Street lawyer. He falls in love with a beautiful young woman, Beverly, who is engaged to his brother, William. When William is killed in a plane crash, Peter marries Beverly and they have a son, Charlie. Later, Beverly dies of cancer and Peter becomes a \"winter's tale\", a fatherless man with no purpose in life. Peter is approached by a mysterious man, Mr. Setterland, who claims to have known his late mother. Setterland asks Peter to perform a dangerous task: to fly to Moscow and extract a document from the Soviet Union's \"Topolov\" files. Peter refuses, but later learns that Setterland may have been his father. He then reconsiders, and travels to Moscow using a fake passport. In Moscow, Peter meets a beautiful Russian woman, Yevgeny, who is also a \"winter's tale\". They fall in love and she tells him about the Russian winter, which is a time of death but also a time of rebirth. Yevgeny helps Peter to translate the Topolov file, which contains the recipe for a deadly nerve agent. When Peter returns to New York, he is arrested by the FBI for violating the passport act. To prove that he is not a spy, Peter shows the FBI the Topolov file, which contains the recipe for the nerve agent. The FBI is unable to translate the file, and Peter is released. Peter decides to destroy the Topolov file, but he is attacked by two men who try to take it from him. He kills one, and the other escapes. Peter then burns the file and throws the ashes into the river. Later, Peter is visited by Setterland, who tells him that he is indeed Peter's father. Setterland explains that Peter's mother was a Russian who defected to the United States during World War II. She was a \"winter's tale\" like Yevgeny, and Setterland fell in love with her. However, she was killed in a car accident in 1960, the same year that Peter was born. Setterland tells Peter that the Topolov file was not a Soviet secret, but a Russian fairy tale. The \"recipe\" was actually a description of a magical potion that could bring the dead back to life. The file was given to Setterland by Peter's mother, and he has been trying to understand it ever since her death. Setterland says that he is ready to die and wants Peter to promise to live, so that he can see the world through Peter's eyes. Peter promises, and Setterland dies. Peter realizes that Setterland was indeed his father, and that he has inherited the \"winter's tale\" from his mother. Winter's Tale is a novel about fathers and sons, love and loss, and the power of storytelling. It is a fable about the importance of living, and about the possibility of redemption and rebirth.",
    " Coffins on Io In 1979, two coffins, each about 1.5 meters (5 ft) long, were discovered on the surface of Io, a moon of the planet Jupiter. The coffins were facing each other, with one set of long narrow rods placed perpendicularly to the body and the other placed parallel to the body. The disposition of the rods suggests that they were intended to support the coffins in a standing position. The structure of the coffins' lids appears to be a series of horizontal and vertical lines scored into the surface of the lid, perhaps forming a ladder-like pattern. The design of the coffins is different from any previously discovered in the Solar System, but the burial practice is similar to that of the Alaskans and other native groups in western North America, where the deceased were placed in standing position with their feet oriented to the direction of the spirits of the dead. The coffins were discovered by Voyager 1 during its flyby of Io on March 5, 1979. They were located on the western edge of the large caldera called thrombrenite, at the edge of a volcanic plateau called Dazet. The two coffins are about 5 km (3.1 mi) apart. The discovery of the coffins caused much speculation about the possibility of life on Io. It was later determined that the coffins, along with many other features on the surface of Io, were formed by thermo-chemical dissolution, in which the combination of extreme temperatures and strong chemicals, possibly including sulfur, breaks down the surface materials. The same process had been previously identified on the surfaces of Mercury and Venus. In August 1979, five months after the Voyager 1 flyby, a team of scientists led by Donald R. Curren of the University of Michigan concluded that the coffins were probably formed by the solidification of a sulfur-rich liquid. The surface of the coffin was determined to be a thin, cracked lid of solid sulfur, and the body of the coffin was thought to be a larger block of solid sulfur that had been hollowed out. The Curren team also found that the rods in the vicinity of the coffins were composed of the same sulfur-rich material as the coffins themselves. The Curren team's findings were published in a 1980 article in the journal Science. In the same issue of Science, a team of scientists led by William B. McKibben of the NASA Ames Research Center presented its own analysis of the coffins. The McKibben team concluded that the coffins were probably formed by the solidification of a sulfur-rich liquid, as the Curren team had suggested. However, the McKibben team also concluded that the coffins were not made of solid sulfur, but rather a sulfur-rich liquid that had hardened into a glass-like solid. The McKibben team's findings were published in a 1980 article in the journal Science. Since the discovery of the coffins, many other features on the surfaces of the planets and their moons have been discovered that were formed by thermo-chemical dissolution. These features include the \"spider\" and \"tortoise\" features on the surface of Mercury, and the \"cauliflowers\" and \"snake-like\" features on the surface of Venus.",

    " Lisburn Road is a road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It runs through the south of the city, close to the River Lagan, and is one of the main shopping streets in the city, forming part of the BONE (Belfast One-way Network Express) traffic-calming system. The road starts at the roundabout junction with Ormeau Road, Malone Road and University Road in the south of the city and runs northwards for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) along a one-way system, crossing the river twice by bridges. It passes through the communities of Malone and Lisburn Road. At its northern end it passes under the M2 motorway and joins the A55 road to Antrim and Belfast International Airport. The Lisburn Road is one of the main roads in Belfast for retail businesses, with a large number of shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. It also has a variety of other businesses and offices. It is close to the main campus of Queen's University Belfast, and is largely residential. The road has been a focal point for the growth of the city's \"Golden Mile\", with many new developments taking place in the area in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In 2008, a study by estate agents Savills described the road as \"the premier high street in Northern Ireland\". Lisburn Road is also the name of a ward in the South Belfast electoral area, which includes the road and the surrounding area. It is part of the South Belfast constituency for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Belfast South constituency for the House of Commons. In 2006, a consultation document on improving the road was prepared by the Department for Regional Development. The document suggested that the road could be closed to traffic, with shoppers having to park in a large underground car park. The proposal met with opposition from some local businesses, residents and politicians, who argued that the road should remain open. In January 2007, the Alliance Party proposed that the road should be pedestrianised, with vehicles restricted to a few local residents and businesses. The Lisburn Road Business Improvement District (BID) was launched in 2007, and is the second BID in Northern Ireland. The BID covers the area from the roundabout at the Ormeau Road to the roundabout at the Malone Road, and from the M2 motorway to the junction with the Lower Malone Road. In October 2010, a large new shopping and leisure complex, the Lisburn Road Central Plaza, was opened on the street, with a number of new retail and restaurant outlets.",

    " Joseph Gluckstein Links are a series of public art works in Manchester, England, by the artist Joe Rush. The works, commissioned by the City of Manchester, consist of a series of 100 bronze \"links\" scattered throughout the city, each one representing a different aspect of the city's history and culture. The links are cast from bronze, using the lost wax process, and mounted on stainless steel posts. They are intended to be stumbled upon accidentally, rather than viewed as a formal collection. The links are located in areas of the city which are not traditionally associated with public art, and are intended to be seen by people who would not normally visit a museum or art gallery. The links have been well received by the public, and have become a favourite topic of conversation in the city. In 2006, the Manchester City Council website received more than 1.5 million hits, as people attempted to find all 100 links. A book, entitled The Joseph Gluckstein Links Walk, has also been published, to help people find the links and learn more about the city. A series of 30 new links were added to the collection in 2007, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original link. These new links, which were designed by local school children, feature a variety of designs, including a guitar, a basketball, and a pair of glasses. In 2009, a further 30 links were added to the collection, bringing the total number of links to 100. These new links, which were designed by local artists, feature a variety of designs, including a pigeon, a bee, and a pair of lips.",
    " A Bell for Adano is a 1944 novel by the American writer John Hersey, who won the Pulitzer Prize for the work in 1945. It tells the story of an Italian-American soldier, Captain Henry W. Moore, who is sent to the small town of Adano in Italy to help organize the civilian population in the face of an anticipated Allied invasion. The title comes from the traditional Italian custom of ringing church bells to announce the presence of an invading force. The book is based on the author's experiences as a war correspondent for The New Yorker in the Italian campaign, although the characters and situations are entirely fictional. Hersey spent three months in the winter of 1944 in the Italian town of Piano di Sorrento, where he interviewed and observed American troops involved with the occupies. He then spent six weeks in the spring of that year in Adano, where he did additional research and interviews for the book. The book is a portrayal of the Italian people under American occupation, and their reaction to the liberators who are also invaders. It is also a story of the American soldiers who try to do their jobs under difficult circumstances, and an insightful look at the military and political leadership of the Allied forces in the Italian campaign.",
    " Lightweighting is the process of reducing the weight of a structural component through a combination of material removal and material replacement. It is closely related to the concept of \"lightweight structures\", which are structures that have a lower weight than would be achieved through the use of conventional materials and section shapes. Lightweighting is often achieved by replacing some or all of the conventional materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, titanium, magnesium, and ceramics) with lightweight materials (e.g., fiber reinforced polymers, polymer matrix composites, metals, and ceramics). Lightweighting can also be achieved by removing material from sections of the structure through the use of holes, cut-outs, and notches. Lightweighting is an important consideration in many industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and consumer products. In the aerospace industry, lightweighting is used to improve the fuel efficiency of aircraft and spacecraft. Lightweighting is also used to improve the performance and range of missiles and spacecraft. In the automotive industry, lightweighting is used to improve the fuel efficiency and handling of automobiles and motorcycles. In the consumer products industry, lightweighting is used to reduce the weight and improve the portability of electronic devices, such as laptops, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants. There are several methods for achieving lightweighting. One method is to use lightweight materials to replace heavier materials. For example, fiber reinforced polymers can be used to replace steel and aluminum. Another method is to use a lightweight material to replace a heavier material in a specific area of the structure. For example, a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer can be used to replace steel in the cockpit of an aircraft. A third method is to remove material from sections of the structure to reduce its weight. For example, holes can be drilled in a steel beam to reduce its weight.",

    " \"Lo fiolairé\" is a song by the French singer-songwriter Renaud. It was released in 1985 as the second single from his fourth studio album, Mistral gauche, on which it appears as the second track. The song is dedicated to the Occitan poet Jean de Vayrèges. \"Lo fiolairé\" is a sophisticated love song, in which the singer boasts of his lover's beauty. The title is a pun: the word fiolairé is a Occitan term meaning \"to make (someone) happy\" and the expression \"filer à l'aïr\" means \"to show off\". The song was a hit in France, where it reached number two on the chart, and in the Netherlands, where it reached number 13. There are two versions of the music video. The first one, directed by Daniel Kleinman, features the singer in a restaurant, surrounded by beautiful women. The second version, directed by Richard Donner, shows Renaud performing the song in a bar while images of women are shown in the background. In 2002, the singer recorded a Spanish version of the song, titled \"Afila el aire\". The lyrics were written by the Cuban-born Spanish singer-songwriter Javier Gazpio, who had previously written two songs for Renaud's Mistral gauche album: \"C'est pas d'l'amour\" and \"J'ai faim de l'amour\". The music video was directed byRamón 1080.",

    " The Tremembé people, also known as the Tremembé-Katukina, are an indigenous people of Brazil, living in the state of Amazonas. They are famous for their long-distance trade, and for having had the first contact with the Portuguese in Brazil. The Tremembé are one of the four branches of the Katukina people, the other three being the Ingarikum, the Iwam, and the Katukina proper. The Tremembé and the Katukina proper are the largest groups. The three branches all speak variants of the Katukina language, which is a language isolate. The Tremembé traditionally lived by farming manioc, which they grew on cleared fields. They used slash-and-burn agriculture, and the manioc was the staple of their diet. The Tremembé also hunted and gathered wild fruits and honey. The Tremembé traditionally practiced long-distance trade, and had a reputation as the best canoeists and navigators in the Amazon. They traded with other indigenous groups up and down the Amazon River, as well as with Europeans. The Tremembé were the first indigenous group in Brazil to have contact with the Portuguese, in 1639. In the early 21st century, the Tremembé population was estimated to be 2,500 to 3,000. As of 2002, when the most recent census of the Tremembé was conducted, 1,262 individuals were counted in 67 villages.",

    " Women in Ghana Ghanaian women have always played significant roles in the country's social, economic, and political development. In recent years, women have increasingly entered into the formal economy, in both urban and rural areas. However, like many other African countries, Ghana still has a long way to go to ensure that women's rights are fully realized. Ghanaian women have traditionally been seen as the backbone of the country's society and economy. In many rural areas, women are responsible for a large portion of the household income, as they are often the primary breadwinners. This is due in part to the fact that many men in rural areas migrate to cities or other countries in search of work, leaving the women behind to care for the family. In recent years, women have been making gains in the formal economy. The number of women-owned businesses has been increasing, and women are also becoming more involved in politics and government. In 2013, Ghana elected its first female president, Joyce Banda, who served a single term. Despite these gains, women in Ghana still face many challenges. One of the biggest issues is the continued inequality between men and women, both socially and economically. Many women still lack basic rights and opportunities, such as access to education, healthcare, and political representation. There are also ongoing concerns about the exploitation of women and girls in Ghana. Many women and girls are subjected to sexual violence, domestic violence, and other forms of abuse. The government has been working to address these issues, but much more needs to be done to ensure that women and girls in Ghana are able to live free from fear and violence. In conclusion, Ghanaian women have played and continue to play important roles in the country's development. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that women's rights are fully realized and that women and girls are able to live free from violence and discrimination.",
    " .coop .coop is the sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) for the cooperative community. The TLD was originally administered by dotCoop, a cooperative association formed specifically for that purpose; it is now administered by Poptel, a subsidiary of the Swedish cooperative Skånet. The domain is open to registration by qualifying cooperatives and cooperative associations. The .coop registry also sponsors the .coop TLD, and manages the DNS root servers for the domain. As of June 2014, .coop was used by more than 1,500 websites. When the .coop TLD was first proposed, there was substantial resistance to the idea of a top-level domain devoted to the cooperative sector. Many in the cooperative community believed that .coop would be a artificial construct that would not be widely used, and therefore would not be justified as a TLD. However, since the .coop TLD was launched, the sector has seen many new .coop websites, including the websites for many well-known cooperatives. The .coop TLD is now a well-established and widely-recognised part of the DNS. In addition, .coop has gained widespread support from the cooperative sector, and is now the only TLD specifically for cooperatives.",

    " \"The Sound of Missing You\" is the ninth track on the A Thousand Suns album by American rock band Linkin Park. The song was written by Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, Dave Farrell, Joseph Hahn and Phoenix. The song was produced by Linkin Park and Rick Rubin. The song is the third single from the album, and was released as a promotional single on September 15, 2010, in the United States. The song is built around a piano riff, which is present throughout the song. The song also features Shinoda's rapped vocals, in addition to his normal singing vocals. The title of the song refers to the pain of being away from a loved one, in which the \"sound\" is the ache from missing that person. The song was leaked onto the internet on August 31, 2010. The song was officially released via streaming on September 15, 2010, via Linkin Park's official website, and was released as a promo single the same day. The song has been performed live by the band at the Mark Hoppus Birthday Bash, and also at the A Thousand Suns listening party, held in Los Angeles, California on October 16, 2010, in which Shinoda performed the rap vocals live for the first time since the song's recording. The song has been well received by critics. James Montgomery from MTV said, \"The song is a mushy merger of the band's hard-hitting rock and Shinoda's rapid-fire rap, all set to a sweeping melody that's as catchy as it is bittersweet. In other words, it's classic Linkin Park, only with a fresh coat of paint.\" The song was used by NBC in promotion for the fifth season of their series Chuck, and is included on the soundtrack for the video game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011. A music video has been made for the song, and was released on October 13, 2010. The video features a couple, whose relationship is deteriorating due to their constant fighting. The video also features Linkin Park in a snowy landscape, performing the song.",
    " Puelche language The Puelche language (Chumash: Piwü'élche; piwü'élche) is one of the Chumash languages, which are spoken by the Puelche people in the Los padres national park of the Los padres mountains of Northern Patagonia in Argentina and in the nearby regions of Chile. Puelche is a language in the Chumash branch of the Hokan language family. The Puelche language is spoken by less than 50 people in Argentina, and the language is in critical danger of extinction. In Argentina the language is taught in some schools as a second language. In the 1960s, a Puelche-speaking couple, Santos and Juana Puelches, were hired to teach Puelche at a school in the town of El Bolsón. The couple taught the language to a number of young people, but most of them did not pass it on to their children or grandchildren. In Chile, the Puelche language is spoken by fewer people and is in a more critical state. The last speakers of Puelche in Chile live in the southern part of the Arauco province in the villages of Toltén and Curral bush, where the language is spoken only by older people. The language has been influenced by the dominant Mapuche language and the Spanish language. There are no written documents of the language and the language is not being taught in any school. The Puelche language has several similar characteristics to the Chumash languages in California. The Puelche language has a number of words which are the same or have the same meaning as the Chumash words. For example, the word for \" elder brother\" is kusi in Puelche and kusi in Chumash, the word for \" younger brother\" is kwa in Puelche and kwa in Chumash, and the word for \"house\" is pú in Puelche and pú in Chumash.",

    " Miracle in the Desert: The Rise and Fall of the Salton Sea The Salton Sea is a vast salt lake in the center of the California Desert, south of the Coachella Valley and the city of Palm Springs. The Sea was created by the engineering of the Colorado River, which was re-directed by the engineers of the California Development Company into the Salton Basin in 1905. By 1907 the basin's irrigation channels were delivering water to the farms of the Imperial Valley; and the Salton Sea was born. In the early years, the Sea was a recreational destination for the wealthy; and a port for the shipping of products from the farms of the Imperial Valley. In the 1920s the Sea's waters became the focus of a resort community, with yacht clubs, resorts, and marinas lining its shores. In the 1930s the wealthy investors sold their holdings to the California State Board of Education, which developed the Sea as a resort area and a fishing lake. The increasing salinity of the lake forced the State of California to build a series of evaporation ponds to control the salinity. As the water evaporated in the ponds, the salt was left behind. The resulting salt became a major revenue source for the State of California. In the 1940s the military took over the Salton Sea, surrounding it with a restricted military zone. The military used the area for testing weapons, and the resulting explosions and constant noise terrified the local population. In the 1950s, the military began to clean up the Salton Sea, and by the 1970s they had largely removed the salt from the lake. As the military cleaned up the lake, the local population began to use it as a recreational destination once again. The city of Palm Springs, seeing the tourist potential of the area, began to promote the Salton Sea as a recreational destination.

    " Regular complex polygon A regular complex polygon is a polygon in the complex plane with all sides equal and all angles equal. If the polygon has an even number of sides, it is called regular and equilateral. If it has an odd number of sides, it is called regular but not equilateral. For a polygon to be regular, the following conditions must apply. 1. All sides must be equal. 2. All angles must be equal. 3. The polygon must be closed. The equilateral regular polygon is the special case of a regular polygon with all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. The regular complex polygon is the complex polygon with all sides equal and all angles equal. It is a polygon with vertices on the complex plane and with sides that are complex numbers. The regular complex polygon is a generalization of the regular polygon to the complex plane. It is used in many areas of geometry, including the theory of algebraic curves, the theory of surfaces, and the theory of partial differential equations. In particular, it is used to define the boundary of a domain in the complex plane. The regular complex polygon can be thought of as the boundary of a disk with spikes at the vertices. The spikes are the lines that connect the center of the disk to the vertices. The interior of the polygon is the open region inside the border of the polygon, and the exterior is the outside region. The regular complex polygon is a special case of a generalization of the regular polygon to higher dimensions. In three dimensions, this generalization is called a regular polyhedron, and in n dimensions, it is called a regular n-polytope.",
    " A solar-powered fountain is a water fountain that is powered by solar panels. Solar-powered fountains are popular for their ability to run without electricity. They are often cheaper to operate than electric fountains, because they do not use electricity. However, solar-powered fountains are generally less powerful than electric fountains. They are also more vulnerable to damage from freezing weather. There are two main types of solar-powered fountains: standalone and integrated. Standalone solar-powered fountains are separate from the rest of the fountain, and they are placed in the fountain to provide extra power. Integrated solar-powered fountains are built into the fountain, and they provide all of the power for the fountain. There are many different types of solar-powered fountains. Some of the most popular types include: - Solar-powered water pumps, which use solar panels to power a water pump. - Solar-powered waterfalls, which use solar panels to power a waterfall. - Solar-powered ponds, which use solar panels to power a pond. - Solar-powered fountains, which use solar panels to power a fountain. There are many benefits to using solar-powered fountains. One of the main benefits is that they are environmentally friendly. They do not use electricity, so they do not produce any emissions. Another benefit is that they are cheaper to operate than electric fountains. Since they do not use electricity, they are much cheaper to run. There are also some drawbacks to using solar-powered fountains. One of the main drawbacks is that they are less powerful than electric fountains.

    " Robin Hood, West Yorkshire The Robin Hood of English folklore is said to have lived in Sherwood Forest, near the town of Nottingham, in Nottinghamshire. According to legend, Robin Hood was a highly skilled archer and swordsman, and served as an outlaw champion of the poor and the weak. The legend of Robin Hood has been adapted numerous times in literature, film and television. There are competing claims to his traditional birthplace. Yorkshire, particularly the district of South Kirkby, has one of the strongest claims. As early as the 14th century, a group of yeomen were organised as the Company of Robin Hood, and in the 15th century, a Robert Hood is recorded as being born in South Kirkby. A 19th-century ballad, \"The Yorkshire Robin Hood\", explicitly identified Robin Hood with this village. A band of outlaws, said to have been based in the forest of Barnsdale, South Yorkshire, is also claimed to have been led by Robin Hood. In the 17th century, the antiquary John Stow claimed that Robin Hood had lived in the village of Locksley, now known as Lidsey, in Yorkshire. In the 19th century, a local landowner built a castle on the site, which he named \"Ravenscrag\", after the reputed home of Robin Hood. In the early 20th century, a New Zealander named Frederick Day claimed to have discovered the grave of Robin Hood in the grounds of a church in South Kirkby. Day returned to New Zealand, however, and the grave's location was not revealed until the 1950s. A blue plaque on the church wall, unveiled in the 1990s, now marks the site.",

    " Paul Schuitema (October 27, 1885 – January 13, 1946) was a Dutch graphic designer, photographer, painter, teacher, and author. Schuitema was born in The Hague. He studied drawing and painting at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, and continued his studies at the Academie Royale in Brussels, where he took lessons from the painter Jan Brouwer Bogaerts (1856–1933). In 1906, he married the writer and teacher Dientje Dijkstra (1870–1945). They had two sons, the photographer Carel Schuitema (1907–1983) and the graphic designer and photographer Paul Schuitema Jr. (1912–1994). In 1908, Schuitema opened a business in The Hague that specialized in the design and production of posters, advertisements, folders, and magazines, as well as the application of colors to glass, wood, and metal. His work in this field is noted for its ergonomic design, use of modern fonts, and innovative use of photography. Schuitema was a member of the Pulchri Studio in The Hague and of the artists' societies Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam and the Hollandse Cabaret in The Hague. In addition to his own work, he was an important collector of the work of others, including that of his students. Schuitema was a professor at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, and the author of several books on the history of art and the applied arts, including Vormgeving in de plastiek (Design in Plastic, 1939), a practical guide to the use of industrial materials such as glass, metal, and plastic in the applied arts. Schuitema's work in the field of graphic design and photography is characterized by a concern for functional design, the use of modern typefaces, and an innovative use of photography. His work is also noted for its use of color, which was influenced by the work of the De Stijl movement and the art of the Amsterdam School. Schuitema's paintings are characterized by their use of bright colors and simplified forms, and are often based on memories of his childhood in The Hague. In 2013, the Museum voor Communicatie in The Hague held an exhibition of Schuitema's work, and in 2015 the photographer BatBoomChikara released a collection of photos of Schuitema's work.",

    " Roth (German: Rotte) is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Bernkastel-Wittlich district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Roth is a state-recognized health resort (Erholungsort) and is hence also called Roth-Siedel. The municipality lies in the western Hunsrück, near the border with the Saarland. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf. ## History Roth lies in a dale between the low Erbeskopf (a mountain) and the high Hunsrück. This area was already settled in prehistoric times. In 1985, a stone ax was found in Roth, and in the nearby village of Niedersayn a stone hatchet. Both finds are from the Neolithic period. Roth's municipal area is rich in prehistoric and early historic finds. Some of them have been gathered together and are on display at the municipal museum. Roth's oldest parts are the so-called Römerberg (German for \"Roman mountain\") and the old village (alte Dorf). The Römerberg is a hill whose eastern slopes, toward the Dierbach valley, have been terraced. On the higher of these two terraces, some of the stone remnants of a Roman country estate (villa rustica) have been preserved. It is believed that the villa had two building phases, the first in the 1st century and the second in the 3rd century. In the lower, western part of the municipal area, towards the Binger Scharlachberg (a hill), have been found several graves from the New Stone Age, the Iron Age, and the Roman period. One of these graves, from the 1st century, yielded the first evidence of a Celtic settlement in the area. Roth had its first documentary mention in 1263. At that time, it was called Rutha. The local saying \"as old as Roth\" (German: alt wie Roth) refers to this. In the 14th century, Roth was pledged to the County of Sponheim. Later it was ruled by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz. After the Veldenz line died out, Roth, in 1556, passed to the Margraviate of Baden. The Margraves of Baden introduced the Reformation into their territories early on. The subjects of the Römerberg farmstead, however, remained Catholic. In the 17th century, the Römerberg was the seat of a noble family, the \"Römer\" (German for \"Roman\"). The last of this line, Anna Regina, died in 1757. She had outlived her two sons, and so the Römer part of the farmstead was inherited by the Protestant branch of the von Gymnich family. After the Thirty Years' War, the Römerberg, which had belonged to the Catholic branch of the family, was sold to the Protestant branch. Since 1707, Roth has been in the Kingdom of Prussia, later the German Empire, and since 1949 in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1757, the Römerberg was acquired by the counts of Metternich. It remained in their ownership until the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) took over the so-called \"Römerturm\" (\"Roman tower\"), which was part of the Römerberg, in 1979. After German reunification, the tower was returned to the municipality of Roth, and it is now in private ownership. In the 19th century, the Römerberg was the home of the so-called Römerkind (German for \"Roman child\"), a girl who was allegedly raised by the \"Römer\" (the last owner of the Römerberg, who had no children of his own). In 1974, Roth became the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf, which was newly formed by the merger of the former municipalities of Thalfang, Kaperich, and Roth. ## Politics ### Municipal council The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. ### Mayor Roth's mayor is Klaus Schoneweg (FDP). ### Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Azure a Wheel of Fortune argent. ## Culture and sightseeing ### Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate's Directory of Cultural Monuments: * Saint Nicholas's Catholic Church (Kirche St. Nikolai),",

    " The Sportpaleis is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the Forest District of Brussels, Belgium. It was the largest indoor arena in the world from 1971 to 2006, and is the current second largest in Europe. The Sportpaleis is primarily used for large concerts and sport events. It has a standing room capacity of 21,000 and a seating capacity of 18,368. The Sportpaleis is part of the Sportpaleis Group, which also includes the Forest National concert venue and the former Sportpaleis jury headquarters in the Radio Building. The Sportpaleis was built in less than three years, and officially opened on 20 November 1970 with a match between the Belgium national football team and their Italian counterparts. The arena was built to serve as the home ground of the Belgium national team, and to provide a modern replacement for the aging Heysel Stadium. However, due to its relatively small size and the introduction of the 5-a-side football tournament in 1970, the Sportpaleis never hosted a major international tournament. The only major international competition to be held at the Sportpaleis was the final of the 1980 European Cup, which was won by Nottingham Forest against Hamburg. The Sportpaleis is also used for other large-scale events, such as concerts and shows. It has hosted several major international artists, such as the Bee Gees, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and Madonna. In 2006, the Sportpaleis was renovated and expanded to a capacity of 21,000. The renovation included the construction of a new entrance hall, a new box office, and a new restaurant. In 2008, the Sportpaleis was designated as a protected monument. In 2013, the Sportpaleis was once again renovated and expanded to a capacity of 21,300. The renovation included the construction of a new entrance hall, a new box office, and a new restaurant.",
    " Cercospora kikuchii is a fungal plant pathogen that causes the disease called black rot in cruciferous plants, especially in the cabbage family (Brassicaceae). It was first described by Japanese mycologist Hironami Kikuchi in 1898. C. kikuchii has a wide host range among the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis thaliana, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, and radishes. It is found in Japan, Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other countries with a warm, humid climate. The disease is characterized by the appearance of small, round, black spots on the leaves and stems of infected plants. The spots are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, and they release spores that are spread to other plants by wind or rain. The spots may also be spread by contaminated soil or by humans through the handling of infected plants. The symptoms of black rot can be confused with those of other diseases, such as downy mildew, but the black spots are distinctive. The disease can cause significant losses in yield and quality of cruciferous crops, and it can be difficult to control. Cultural control methods, such as removing and destroying infected plants and practicing proper sanitation, can help to reduce the spread of the disease. Fungicides can also be used to control C. kikuchii, but they must be applied before the disease appears in order to be effective. C. kikuchii is a member of the genus Cercospora, which includes several other species that cause disease in a variety of plants. Cercospora includes the species C. beticola, C. canescens, C. cladosporioides, C. coccodes, C. kunauii, C. lilii, C. malachrae, C. moniliforme, C. personatum, C. phaseolii, C. piperis, C. potatoeae, C. pyri, C. solani, C. syringae, C. theae, C. thomasiicola, and C. zinniae.",

Buildings and structures There are hundreds of properties and districts listed on the National Register. The great majority of these are buildings and structures. There are two types of properties which are further differentiated by their historical significance: 1. Historic — A property or district that was once the site of a significant event or the home of a famous person, contains a significant structure, or is associated with a significant person or event. 2. architectural — A property or district that has special architectural or engineering significance, or is associated with a significant person or event.

It was produced by George T.Goodman for Paramount Pictures. The film also features Barbara Nichols, Lee Patrick, and Ray Walston. The film is based on the 1953 novel by Hal Southwell, The Longest Night, which was a rewrite of his own novel, The Whirlwind. Southwell's novel was in turn based on a real-life news story that he had heard about, about a man who escaped from a mental institution on April 1. The film was shot in Paramount's own studio in Los Angeles. The film's art director was Hal Perdoner. The film was released in April 1954. The film was entered into the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. The film was remade in 2008, starring Michael Douglas and Ashton Kutcher. Plot On April 1, a man is shot while running across a field. Hestaggers into a police station and dies. The police initially assume it was an accident, but the man's brother, Fred Amiel, insists that it was murder, and that the killer is \"collecting signatures\". Amiel's brother was the latest in a series of recent deaths, all of which were apparently accidental, but all of which had a similar MO. In each case, the \"victim\" was running, and was shot in the back. The police, led by Captain Moxley, are skeptical of Amiel's claim, especially after he produces a list of future victims, with April 1, 1954, being the next date on the list. As a result, the police set out to find the killer before he can strike again. In the process, they discover a pattern: all of the victims were involved in a car accident, and all of them had recently visited a certain garage. The police suspect the owner of the garage, a man named Harbin, but he proves to be a dead end. Still, the police feel that they are getting closer to the truth, and they increase their surveillance of potential victims. One of these victims is a woman named Julie, who lives with her roommate, Thelma. The police stake out the apartment, and manage to catch the killer in the act of making his escape. It turns out that the \"killer\" was Thelma, who had been trying to make Julie's life more interesting. It is then revealed that Fred Amiel was the killer, and that the entire story was an April Fools' joke. The real killer, a man named Reynolds, was accidentally shot by Amiel during a struggle. Reynolds, who was dressed as a police officer at the time, was trying to frame Amiel. Amiel is taken to the police station, where he confesses to the murders. However, as he is being taken to the jail, he escapes and runs across a field. He is shot in the back and killed by one of the police officers.

Garaguly's work was strongly influenced by the art of the Old Masters, particularly that of the Italian Renaissance. He sought to combine traditional techniques and motifs with modern ideas and materials. This can be seen in his prints, where he often used modern techniques such as photomechanics to create images that were both modern and traditional in their appearance. In his paintings, Garaguly often used traditional materials such as tempera and gold leaf, but he also incorporated modern elements, such as the use of industrial materials and the depiction of urban scenes. Garaguly was a teacher at the Berliner Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst (The Berlin College of Graphics and Book Art) from its foundation in 1927 until his death in 1938.

    " Gramicidin B is a 16-residue beta-lactamase peptide isolated from the bacteria Bacillus brevis. It is a potent and specific inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) family, especially those from Bacillus species. Gramicidin B is a cationic peptide with an elaiose-like macrocycle and an acetylated N-terminus. It is a trans-membrane peptide with the N-terminus on the exterior and the C-terminus on the interior. The N-terminus is acetylated with a fatty acid, which is required for its activity. The antimicrobial activity of gramicidin B results from the specific inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. The binding of gramicidin B to PBPs is mediated by the C-terminal region of gramicidin B, which is responsible for beta-lactamase inhibition, and the N-terminal region, which is responsible for PBP binding. Gramicidin B is a member of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) inhibitor family. Other members of this family include the beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, and cephalexin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam.",

    " Autopharmacology Autopharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs and other substances on the body when those substances are self-administered. The term is derived from the Greek prefix \"auto\" (self) and the Latin word \"pharma\" (drug). In this context, the term \"self-administered\" refers to substances that are not prescribed by a physician or other health professional, and substances that are not consumed for the purpose of maintaining or improving one's health. The term \"autopharmacology\" was coined in 1970 by the Hungarian-born psychologist Albert Michotte to describe the effects of self-administered substances in his book, The Psychology of the Other: An Empirical and Theoretical Study of Social Perception. In the book, Michotte proposed that people develop attitudes toward drugs and other substances that are a function of their perceived psychological effects. In the subsequent decades, autopharmacology has been studied by researchers from various disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and neuroscience. These researchers have investigated a range of topics, including the effects of self-administered substances on mood, cognitive functioning, and physiological processes, as well as the psychological and physiological mechanisms that underlie the effects of these substances. One key area of research in autopharmacology is the study of substance use disorders, which are characterized by the inability to control substance intake and the negative consequences of substance use. Researchers have investigated the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms that underlie substance use disorders, and have developed treatments and interventions to help individuals with these disorders manage their substance intake and improve their overall well-being. In addition to substance use disorders, autopharmacology research has also explored the effects of self-administered substances on various medical conditions, including pain, sleep, and mood disorders. Researchers have investigated the potential benefits and risks of using self-administered substances to manage these conditions, and have sought to understand the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the effects of these substances. Overall, autopharmacology is a complex and multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the effects of self-administered substances on the body and mind, as well as the psychological and physiological mechanisms that underlie these effects.",

    " The Williams–Landel–Ferry equation is an equation that describes the relationship between the rate of reaction and the length of a reaction. The equation was first described by Arnold Williams in 1925, George Landel in 1927, and further developed by R. T. Ferry in 1929. The equation is often written in an empirical form: where q is the reaction rate, Z is the length of a reaction, and α, β, and γ are constants. The equation is based on the idea that the rate of reaction can be affected by the length of a reaction. The length of a reaction is the time that a reaction has been occurring. The equation also takes into account the idea that the rate of reaction can increase or decrease over time. The constants α, β, and γ can be determined by fitting the equation to experimental data. The Williams–Landel–Ferry equation is often used to describe the kinetics of polymerization reactions. In this case, the rate of reaction is the rate of polymerization, and the length of the reaction is the time that the polymerization has been occurring. The equation can also be used to describe the kinetics of other types of reactions, such as the decomposition of a substance or the formation of a covalent bond. In some cases, the Williams–Landel–Ferry equation is used to describe the kinetics of a reaction in which the rate of reaction is affected by the length of the reaction. In other cases, the equation is used to describe the kinetics of a reaction in which the rate of reaction is not affected by the length of the reaction.",
    " William Smith (loyalist) (January 17, 1756 – July 22, 1822) was a businessman, judge, politician, and statesman who helped found the state of Tennessee and signed the United States Constitution. Born in Elizabeth County, New Jersey, Smith attended the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) and graduated in 1774. He joined the Continental Army in 1775 and served as an officer in the New Jersey Line during the American Revolutionary War. He was taken prisoner by the British in the fall of 1776 and held in New York until he was paroled in June 1778. He rejoined the Continental Army in 1781 as a staff officer and served in that capacity until the close of the war. After the war, Smith moved to the newly established state of Tennessee and settled in Nashville, where he became a wealthy businessman and slaveholder. He was a member of the state constitutional convention in 1796, and he helped Tennessee become the 16th state in 1796. He also helped draft the constitution of the new state. In 1799, Smith was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served three terms. He was a member of the Federalist Party and an advocate of strong federal government. He also served as a state court judge and as a member of the Tennessee Supreme Court. In 1815, Smith was chosen by the Tennessee General Assembly to be one of the state's two United States Senators, along with Daniel Smith (no relation). The two senators served together from 1815 to 1821, when William Smith retired. He died the following year.",
    " The 1969 Texas A&I Javelinas football team was an American football team that represented Texas A&I University (now known as Texas A&M University–Kingsville) as a member of the Lone Star Conference (LSC) during the 1969 NAIA football season. In its third season under head coach Ron Harms, the team compiled a perfect 11-0 record, won the Lone Star Conference (LSC) championship, and defeated Arizona State– Temperley, 27–7, in the NAIA National Championship Game. The team was led on offense by junior quarterback Ken Hastings, who was assisted by a strong running attack that featured Jimmy Raye and Bo Burris. The team's defense featured All-American defensive tackle Gary Adams, who led the NAIA in tackles with 151, and defensive end Roger Hair, who led the NAIA in sacks with 17. In addition to being the first NAIA football team to finish undefeated and untied since 1953, the 1969 Javelinas were the first team in school history to win a post-season football game. The team was ranked No. 1 in the NAIA's final regular season poll, and was also ranked No. 1 in the final NAIA playoff poll, ahead of No. 2 Arizona State– Temperley. The 1969 Javelinas were the first of three NAIA football teams to finish undefeated and untied during the 1960s. The others were the 1968 Texas A&I Javelinas and the 1970 Trinity Tigers.",
    " History of the ambulance The earliest known use of the ambulance is found in the writings of the ancient Greek historian, Thucydides. He describes the use of \"a cart with a lifting gangway\" for the transport of the wounded from the field of battle in the year 420 BC. In the early Roman Empire, the Republic's army had a designated \"Vehiculum Sacrum\" or \"sacred vehicle\" for the transport of the dead and the wounded. The Roman army used horses and mules for the transport of the sick and the wounded. They also used oxen and slaves to pull the \"Vehiculum Sacrum\". The \"Vehiculum Sacrum\" was a common sight on the battlefields of the ancient world. In the medieval period, the church used the \"Arca\" or \"box\" to transport the relics of saints. The \"Arca\" was also used to transport the wounded. In the 16th century, the ambulance was used to transport the wounded from the battlefields of the Thirty Years' War. The first organized group of ambulance drivers was the \"Holy Ghost Fathers\" of the Society of Jesus, a Catholic order of priests. In the 18th century, the ambulance was used to transport the wounded from the battlefields of the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. The ambulance was first used by the British military in the year 1804. In the year 1812, the United States Congress authorized the use of the ambulance for the military. In the 19th century, the ambulance was used to transport the wounded from the battlefields of the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War, and the Russo-Turkish War. In the 20th century, the ambulance was used to transport the wounded from the battlefields of World War I and World War II. In the 21st century, the ambulance is used to transport the wounded from the scene of an accident or medical emergency to the hospital. The ambulance is also used to transport the sick and the wounded in non-emergency situations.",
    " Fakhra Younus (Urdu: فخرا یونس) (born 26 July 1979) is a Pakistani woman who was badly burned in a fire following an acid attack on her in 2002. She was the first acid attack victim to file a criminal case in Pakistan and the first to do so successfully. Born in 1979 in Lahore, Pakistan, Younus was a student of Psychology at the Government College University, Lahore. On 24 June 2002, she was attacked with acid by her ex-husband, Abdul Hafeez, who was upset that she had left him. He had asked her to leave the house after Younus had accused him of harassment. The attack left her with severe burns on her face and body. After the attack, Younus was admitted to the burns ward of the Mayo Hospital in Lahore, where she received treatment for four months. Her family was unable to afford the cost of treatment, and the hospital did not have the facilities to treat such severe burns. She was then referred to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, a charity hospital in Lahore, where she received treatment for free. In 2002, Younus filed a criminal case against her ex-husband in the court of law, becoming the first acid attack victim to do so in Pakistan. In the same year, she also filed a civil case against her attacker. Her ex-husband was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by the court. Younus was awarded compensation of Pakistan Rupee 500,000 (approximately US$5,000) by the court, as well as the costs of her medical treatment. She used the money to establish a rehabilitation centre for acid attack victims in Lahore. In 2006, Younus was given the Kennedy Center for International Delegations Award for her efforts in helping other acid attack victims in Pakistan. In 2009, she received the Martin Luther King Non-Violent Peace Prize. In 2010, she married a civil engineer, Muhammad Fayyaz, and the couple has two sons. In 2015, she was appointed as the first female honorary consul general of Poland in Lahore. In 2015, the Government of Pakistan awarded her with the Sitara-i-Imtiaz, the third highest civilian honour and decoration of the country, for her efforts in helping acid attack victims in Pakistan.",

    " Cello Sonata (Strauss) \"Cello Sonata (Strauss)\" is a sonata for solo cello and orchestra by the German composer Richard Strauss. The work, which was premiered in Berlin on 10 January 1897, is one of the few works by the composer that he himself did not conduct. The conductor on this occasion was Felix Weingartner, who also gave the work its title; the original German title was simply \"Cello-Sonate\". The work is dedicated to the cellist Robert Hausmann, who played the premiere. The work is in three movements, although the first two are played without a break. The first movement is in sonata form, with a lengthy polyphonic first subject and a short, scalar second subject. The development section is based on the first subject, and is followed by a recapitulation of both subjects, after which the movement concludes with a short coda. The second movement is in D minor, and is marked \"Romanza: Sehr langsam\". It is mainly made up of two sections, the first of which is marked \"Das Thema\" (the theme), and the second of which is marked \"Das Motiv\" (the motive). The movement concludes with a short coda. The third movement is a set of variations on a theme in F major, which is followed by a brief finale. The work has been recorded many times, with the most recent recordings being made in 2006 by Peter Bruns as part of a complete set ofStrauss's works for solo instrument and orchestra, and in 2013 by Daniel Barenboim with the Berlin Philharmonic. The critical reception to the work has been mixed. The most recent study of the work, by David Gutman in 2004, criticised the work for failing to take sufficient advantage of the particular characteristics of the cello as a musical instrument, and for being derivative of the style of the earlier German Romantic composers. The most frequently cited example of this is the opening theme of the first movement, which Gutman compares to the opening of Johannes Brahms's Piano Sonata No. 1 in the same key, and to the theme of the first movement of Brahms's Violin Concerto. On the other hand, the work's most recent performer, Daniel Barenboim, has said that the sonata is \"a hidden treasure ... it is a wonderful piece, full of melodies and with a profound emotional content\".",
    " Mirgor is a malevolent god in Slavic mythology, depicted as a dragon or a half-humanoid, half-dragonoid creature. According to Czech folklore, Mirgor was the son of a devil and a she-dragon, and was himself born a dragon. He was said to be the enemy of all humanity, and to have a huge cavern where he would lick his wounds and hide from the sun. From his lair, Mirgor would send his servants, the Strzygli, to terrorize the countryside. Mirgor is depicted in art as a dragon with a human upper body, with long hair and a beard. He is often shown wearing a crown. In some legends, Mirgor is said to have had a daughter who was married to a human. The human eventually grew tired of life with the dragon, and killed her. In retaliation, Mirgor killed the groom and burned the bride's body. He then went to the village and demanded that the villagers pay him for the death of his daughter. If they did not pay, he would destroy their village and all who lived in it. Some sources say that Mirgor is the same entity as the Serbian dragon, Vyala.",
    " Maurice Polydore Marie Bernadin de La Fize, better known by the pseudonym Maurice Maeterlinck (25 August 1862 – 7 October 1949), was a Belgian playwright, poet, and winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was also a professor of French literature at the University of Ghent, a Belgian army officer, and a culture minister. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, the son of a printer and a housewife. He studied at the Ghent Municipal Technical School, and then at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels. He served for seven years in the Belgian army, reaching the rank of captain. After a short stint in the customs service, he studied literature and philosophy at the University of Ghent, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy in 1891. His thesis, Le règne de Diderot, was published the following year. In 1892 he became a professor of French literature at the University of Ghent, and in 1895 he married the pianist and composer Lily el Korea (1871–1919). In his first important work, La Morale en Politique (1893), Maeterlinck attacked the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and the Egoism of Max Stirner. He argued instead for a return to the old Christian virtues. In a famous passage, he asserted that \"God is dead, and we have killed him, we who have taken from him the rhyme and the measure.\" In the plays that made him famous, Maeterlinck depicted the fate of the individual in a world subject to natural forces beyond human control. The heroes of these plays are isolated figures in an indifferent universe, attempting to find their own way and to assert their own will in the face of hostile or uncertain forces. In the best known of these plays, L'Intruse (The Intruder, 1897), a maniacal murderer is on the loose. The hero's family is threatened, and the hero himself becomes obsessed by the idea that he may be the murderer. In the end, the murderer is revealed to be a neighbor, but the hero's own fear and doubt have destroyed his life. In the plays that followed, such as Les Aveugles (The Blind, 1898), La Mort de Tintagiles (The Death of Tintagiles, 1900), and Le Règne du Mal (The Kingdom of Evil, 1901), the author continued to explore the theme of the isolation of the individual. His characters seek to understand their place in the universe and to find meaning in their lives. In Le Règne du Mal especially, Maeterlinck seems to have been influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly by the idea that the world is divided into the forces of light and the forces of darkness, with the hero alone standing between the two. In the first decade of the 20th century, Maeterlinck's reputation as a dramatist was at its height. His plays were performed in the leading theaters of Europe and America, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911. His works of the period include La Gazelle (The Gazelle, 1900), La Source (The Source, 1901), Le Voyage d'Ulysse (The Voyage of Ulysses, 1904), and Intérieur ( Interiors, 1911). After World War I, during which he served as a culture minister in the Belgian government in exile, Maeterlinck's popularity began to wane. In the 1920s and 1930s he was largely ignored, though he continued to write until his death in 1949. In his later works, such as La Course du Fortune (The Way of the World, 1928), he seems to have been influenced by the Surrealists, with their emphasis on the subconscious and the dream world. Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"in appreciation of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a noble style, a deep moral insight, and a true patriotism.\"",

The 49ers were attempting to improve upon their 7–10 record from 2021, which was the franchise's worst record since 2008. After starting the season with five consecutive wins, including a victory over the defending Super Bowl champions, the 49ers suffered a loss to the New York Giants in Week 6. This began a stretch where the 49ers lost four of their next five games, including a Week 10 loss to the Carolina Panthers that dropped them to 6–5. Despite the rough patch, the 49ers won four of their final six games to finish with a 10–8 record and secure a wild card spot in the playoffs. In the wild card game, the 49ers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 13–10 to advance to the divisional round. However, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 20–16 in the next game. After the season, Shanahan was fired as head coach, and the 49ers hired Mike McDaniel as his replacement. This was the 49ers' final season at Levi's Stadium, as the team will move to the new Snapdragon Stadium in Santa Clara in 2023. ## Offseason ### Coaching changes After the 49ers' 7–10 season in 2021, head coach Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers mutually agreed to part ways.

    " Cruciate ligament, also called the cruciate tendon, is a ligament that crosses from one side of a joint to the other, in front of the other ligaments, and in front of the joint cavity. The term \"cruciate\" (from the Latin crux, cross) refers to the cross-shaped arrangement of the collagen fibers that make up the ligament. Collagen fibers are strong and flexible fibers that serve to bind together the cells of the connective tissue. The cruciate ligament is one of several ligaments that cross a joint. The other major ligaments that cross a joint are the collateral ligaments. There are two cruciate ligaments in the knee, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). They are called cruciate ligaments because their collagen fibers form a cross shape. The cruciate ligaments are the primary ligaments that stabilize the knee joint. The ACL is located in the front part of the knee and the PCL is located in the back part of the knee. The ACL and PCL are both attached at the top to the thigh bone (femur) and at the bottom to the lower leg bone (tibia). The ACL and PCL work together to stabilize the knee and prevent the thigh bone and the lower leg bone from moving in opposite directions. This is important for the normal functioning of the knee. The cruciate ligaments are the most commonly injured ligaments in the knee. The ACL is most often injured when the knee is twisted or bent in a traumatic way. The PCL is most often injured when the knee is bent too far backward. When the cruciate ligaments are injured, the knee can become unstable and prone to further injury. In many cases, surgery is needed to reconstruct the cruciate ligaments and restore stability to the knee.",

    " Jean the Birdman Jean-Claude Romand, also known as Jean the Birdman (4 October 1942 – 15 May 1993), was a French serial killer, who between 1984 and 1989 killed at least seven women. He was dubbed \"the Birdman\" by the French press after he was arrested on 31 January 1989 after a neighbour heard his victims' birdsong-like screams. Romand was born in a French-speaking family in 1942 in a suburb of Lyon. He had a twin sister, Jacqueline. When he was six years old, his father, a businessman, died in a car accident. His mother never recovered from this tragedy, and the family fell into poverty. As a child, Romand was a lonely outcast, and often bullied. He became obsessed with birds, and spent much time watching them. His mother did not allow pets in the house, so he would catch birds and keep them in his room. He was also known for his extraordinary memory, which enabled him to learn the names of all his classmates. After finishing school, Romand studied medicine. In 1967, he married a fellow student, Michelle, with whom he had two daughters. The couple separated in 1981. In 1983, Romand began a relationship with a single mother, Anne, who had a young daughter, Blandine. In 1984, he began to serve as a doctor in a small town, Saint-Etienne-de-Saint-Geoirs, in the Rhône department. He was popular with patients, and known for his helpfulness. At the same time, he began to kill his lovers one by one. On 31 January 1989, Romand invited his latest lover, Catherine Gauthier, to his apartment in Lyon. As usual, he had taken care to make the surroundings pleasant, with flowers, wine, and music. He then attacked Gauthier, forcing her to drink a large quantity of alcohol and champagne. When she resisted, he choked her with his bare hands. Gauthier's bird, which she had brought with her, began to chirp. It had become accustomed to Romand's apartment, and was attracted to the food he had provided for it. The bird's chirping alerted Romand's neighbour, who telephoned the police. The police arrived and, after failing to gain entry to the apartment, summoned a locksmith. Meanwhile, Romand had left the apartment and was captured by the police in the early morning of 1 February. At his trial, Romand claimed he was innocent. He said that he had been framed by the police, who had altered the crime scene. He stated that Gauthier had been killed by a violent ex-boyfriend, and that he had only been trying to help her. The court did not believe his claims, and on 25 June 1992 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Gauthier, and given a minimum term of 25 years. In May 1993, a few days after his 41st birthday, Romand was found dead in his prison cell. He had committed suicide by hanging himself with his bed sheets.",

    " USA-201, also known as GPS IIR-1 and GPS SVN-36, is an American navigation satellite which forms part of the Global Positioning System. It was the first satellite to be launched in the GPS IIR series, and the first to be launched since the failure of USA-200 in December 2006. USA-201 was manufactured by Boeing, and is the twenty-seventh GPS satellite to be launched. The satellite has a mass of 2,000 kg, and is the first to be launched since the Block IIR specification was introduced. It is the first GPS satellite to be launched on a Delta IV carrier rocket, which was chosen because of its higher payload capacity compared to the Delta II used to launch earlier GPS satellites. The satellite is designed to replace the USA-127 satellite, which was launched in 2000. It was successfully launched at 22:41 UTC on May 31, 2007, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The launch was originally scheduled for December 2006, but was delayed because of problems with a Delta IV rocket used to launch a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office. USA-201 is a Block IIR GPS satellite, and has a design life of 12 years. It has a single solar array, which powers the satellite's systems, and a single radio frequency transmitter, which is used to transmit radio signals to ground stations and to other GPS satellites. The satellite's navigation system is designed to be used by the military, and can be used to pinpoint the location of a user to within a few meters. It can also be used to provide information on the user's velocity and the time that they were at a particular location.

    " Internorm is an Austrian company that produces doors, windows, and conservatories. The company was established in 1931 in Wiener Neustadt. In the early 1930s, the company's founder, Alois Internorm, recognised the need for affordable, high-quality window frames. He started a business in his parents' house, where he built window frames from timber. The growing demand for his products enabled him to expand the business throughout Austria and by 1938 the company had a workforce of over 250 employees. After the Second World War, the company began to manufacture doors and windows from aluminium. The company's products were used in the construction of the Vienna Hilton and the Austria Center Vienna. In the early 1960s, Internorm started to build windows from uPVC. In the 1980s, the company opened sales offices in Germany and Switzerland. In 2006, Internorm was taken over by the German window manufacturer Winkelmann. The following year, the Internorm brand was transferred to the newly established Internorm Holding, which is owned by Winkelmann and the German investment company Capvis. In 2013, Internorm opened a new production facility in Russia. In 2014, the company opened sales offices in the United States and China. In 2015, Internorm became the first window manufacturer to receive the \"Made in Austria\" certificate from the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber. In 2016, the company opened a new production facility in Hungary. In 2018, Internorm launched a new generation of windows and doors with an improved energy efficiency rating.",
    " Un caso di coscienza Un caso di coscienza (A Case of Conscience) is a 1965 Italian science fiction film directed by Pietro Germi. It is based on the 1959 novel by Giovanni Ottati. A nuclear scientist (Italian: \"una scienza nucleare\" can also mean \"a nuclear power plant\" or \"a nuclear reaction\") who has developed a new, more efficient method of nuclear fusion, together with a friend, goes to the desert to test it. They discover a flying saucer in the desert, and the scientist, Mario, radios his findings to his colleague, Paolo. However, the military finds out about the discovery and, led by the anti-communist General Parken, closes in on the location in order to destroy the evidence. The aliens, who have been studying Earth and its inhabitants for a long time, take Mario back to their planet. There he meets two aliens, Morbius and his daughter Julia, who are the only two survivors of their race. Julia has been raised by Morbius since her birth, and has never seen another alien. As she is now of marriageable age, Morbius expects her to choose a husband from her race's superior specimens: the most advanced and intelligent of the species. As part of his plan to introduce Julia to \"the best of the Earth\", Morbius has taken samples of the most outstanding humans – including one of the greatest scientists, one of the most powerful politicians, and one of the most famous actors – to the planet. Julia is impressed by Mario, and chooses him as her husband. However, Mario, feeling guilty, wants to return to Earth. With the help of Morbius, he disguises himself as an alien and returns to the same spot in the desert where he was first picked up. General Parken and his troops arrive, but are unable to tell that he is a human, and take him to the military base. There, he discovers that the general's daughter has been born with a deformity: a large, hairy mole on her face. He offers to help the general by letting him use his method to create a new, perfect, non-human race, but the general refuses and shoots him. Un caso di coscienza was shown in Italy in 1965. It was released in the United States in 1967, where it was also known as The Case of the Sinful Doctor, with English dialogue added. It was shot at the Fellini Studios in Rome. The film was a minor financial success, but critical reception was mixed. In Italy, the film was generally considered a failure, although some critics praised the film's \"elegant\" and \" expressive\" use of colour. In the United States, the film was sometimes compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which had been released two years earlier. Some critics considered the film \"silly\", while others said that it had \"some of the most absurd situations ever conceived by man\". The film has been described as an \"Italianate\" take on the alien invader genre, and as combining \"elements of nuclear paranoia, A-bomb chic, and space opera\" with \"comedy, farce, and religious meditation\". The film's \" twist ending\" has also been praised, as has the performance of Dominique Boschero.",

    " Clientitis (from Greek κλειν, \"client\" and -itis, \"disease\") is an involuntary servitude to a client, in a broad sense. In the narrow sense, it is used to describe the sycophantic behavior of a professional towards a client. Clientitis is a major concern in the legal profession, where it may lead to conflicts of interest, but the term is used more generally to describe any such pattern of behavior. The term clientitis was coined by the German-American engineer and management consultant Robert H. Waterman, Jr. in his 1983 book, Up and Down the Organization: Lessons from the trenches for the working world. Waterman described clientitis as \"the natural and inevitable result of a person's continued subjection to a one-sided relationship.\" Clientitis is often associated with professional services, such as law and accounting, where the service provider works on a one-to-one basis with the client. The professional becomes emotionally dependent on the client, and this dependence is typically reinforced by the fact that the professional's pay is dependent on the client's continued business. The professional becomes afraid to tell the client \"no\", and instead focuses on pleasing the client. The client, meanwhile, takes advantage of the professional's clientitis, and continues to demand more and more work, while paying less and less. Professional service providers can combat clientitis by establishing clear boundaries and rules at the beginning of the relationship, and enforcing them. Clientitis can also be combated by regularly reviewing the relationship and, if necessary, terminating the relationship. In some cases, a simple \"no\" is all that is necessary to stop clientitis in its tracks. In a larger sense, clientitis can be seen as a form of power dynamics, with the client holding power over the service provider. Clientitis can also be seen as a form of exploitation, with the client taking advantage of the service provider's dependence on them. In some cases, clientitis can lead to a toxic working environment, with the service provider feeling resentment towards the client. Clientitis can be combated by establishing clear boundaries and rules at the beginning of the relationship, and enforcing them. Clientitis can also be combated by regularly reviewing the relationship and, if necessary, terminating the relationship. In some cases, a simple \"no\" is all that is necessary to stop clientitis in its tracks.",
    " Robert Gillespie (1637–1715) was an Irish Protestant minister and scholar, a prolific writer and a versatile, erudite, and innovative theologian. Gillespie was born in Dublin, the son of an Irish Protestant minister, and was educated at Trinity College Dublin (BA, 1661; MA, 1664), where he was a fellow from 1664 to 1674. He was ordained a minister in the Church of Ireland in 1667 and two years later became the incumbent of the parish of Newtownbarry in County Cork, where he ministered for the next forty years. Gillespie was married to Mary, the daughter of the Rev. Arthur Ussher, the Church of Ireland minister for the nearby parish of Carrigaline. They had four sons and three daughters, including the Rev. Arthur Gillespie (1676–1766), the Church of Ireland minister for the parish of Bandon and a noted scholar. In 1699, the Rev. John Stearne, the Church of Ireland minister for the parish of Midleton, was accused of heresy and suspended from his ministry. His parishioners, who were in a state of unrest because of a disputed election to the Irish House of Commons, organised a protest against his suspension. They invited Gillespie, who was widely recognised as a spokesman for the moderate, intellectual tendency in the Church of Ireland, to preach to them. He agreed and, in the resulting sermon, took the line that while the Church of Ireland was not a perfect church it was, nevertheless, a true church. The sermon was widely circulated and led to increased support for the moderate line, which was favoured by the established church's bishops, in preference to the more radical, Nonconformist tendency. Gillespie was a member of the Dublin Society, a group of Dublin-based scholars who met regularly to discuss intellectual and cultural topics. The members included the economist and lawyer William Bruce (1680–1730), the historians James Ware (1565–1666) and his son Sir James Ware (1682–1769), the archaeologist and physician William Batt (c.1620–1704), the classical scholar and Church of Ireland minister Charles Lucas (1694–1747), the statistician Edward Hopkins (1644–1741), the chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1704), and the politician and writer Edmund Curll (c.1675–1747). The Dublin Society's members were united by their intellectual curiosity and their desire for knowledge for its own sake, and they pursued a wide range of interests, including history, geography, the natural sciences, medicine, agriculture, and the arts. They were influential in a number of areas, including the development of Irish agriculture and the establishment of the Royal Dublin Society, which was granted a royal charter in 1731. Gillespie's most significant contribution to scholarship was his edition of the works of the Church of Ireland theologian and historian, Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667), which was published in four volumes in five parts between 1704 and 1707. This was the first critical edition of Taylor's works and the standard edition for the next century. It included an extensive commentary on the texts, which was written by Gillespie and by the Church of Ireland minister and scholar William Law (1686–1761). Gillespie also wrote a commentary on the Bible, which was published in 1710, and a series of sermons on the Church of England's Articles of Religion, which were published in 1713. In addition, he contributed articles on a range of topics to the Dublin Society's journal, the Transactions. Gillespie's works were widely read and highly influential. They were praised for their learning, their lucidity, and their ability to present complex ideas in an accessible manner. They were also noted for their ecumenism, which was informed by Gillespie's belief that the Church of Ireland was part of a larger Christian community that included both Catholics and Protestants.",
    " Kero Kero Chime (ero ero chime, lit. 'ero ero time') is a Japanese expression for the time between 1:30 am and 2:00 am. The term \"Kero Kero Chime\" is derived from the Japanese kero (ケロ), meaning \"hour\" (as in \"o'clock\"), and chime (チャイム), the sound made by a clock. The minimum number of hours in a day in Japanese tradition is 24, and the time between 1:30 am and 2:00 am is the 30th hour of the day. The term \"Kero Kero Chime\" is mostly used by young people on internet forums and in manga and anime to refer to the time that one is not supposed to be awake. The time period from 1:30 am to 2:00 am is also called \"The Dirty Thirty\" in English. The Japanese phrase \"ero ero time\" became widely known to the English-speaking world after it was used in the anime Sword Art Online. In Sword Art Online, the term is used to refer to a period of time in which the Aincrad system will activate a boss-level AI at random. Most players refer to it as the \"death zone\", as almost all players who encounter a boss-level AI during this time period are killed immediately.",
    " Young Avengers is a team of teenage superheroes in the Marvel Universe, appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team is composed of teenage versions of well-known superheroes, as well as several teenage superheroes who do not have adult versions. The Young Avengers were formed by Iron Lad, who was a teenage version of the adult superhero Iron Man. The team's adventures are featured in their own self-titled series, Young Avengers, as well as in The Avengers, New Avengers, and other Marvel comics. The Young Avengers are the teenage sidekicks of the adult Avengers, and work closely with their mentors. The team also has a close relationship with the similarly aged team of teenage X-Men, the New Mutants. The Young Avengers was the brainchild of writer Brian Michael Bendis, who created the team to increase the profile of the then-new teenage heroes. The Young Avengers first appeared in The Avengers #1 (May 1996), though the team was actually formed one issue earlier, in New Avengers #1 (April 1996), in which Iron Lad recruited the other team members. The Young Avengers then appeared in a four-issue self-titled limited series in 1998, written by Christopher Yost and drawn by Stephen Sadowski, and in an ongoing series, Young Avengers, which ran for 75 issues between 2005 and 2007, written by Bendis and drawn by Yost. The Young Avengers are featured in the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, in which they are shown as having a facility of their own, and in the live-action film Avengers: Infinity War, in which they are shown as having been inspired by the adult Avengers and as having built their own headquarters in a compound owned by Tony Stark.",

    " MAGEA3 is a gene that in humans is located on chromosome X, at position Xp22.3, from base pair 75,901,232 to base pair 75,968,XT — 75,968,XT — 75,968,232. The Mage protein is a member of the MAGEA gene family, a group of highly homologous genes whose expression is primarily limited to cancer cells. The MAGEA genes are closely related to the gene family encoding the protein products of the MAGEA gene family, which are expressed in cancer cells and have a role in tumorigenesis. MAGEA3 is one of the five genes, including MAGEA1, MAGEA2, MAGEA4, and MAGEA5, whose expression is direct, or indirect, in tumor cells. The MAGEA gene family, including MAGEA3, has been highly conserved during evolution, and it is possible that these genes have important roles in the regulation of cell growth and division. In fact, several studies have shown that the expression of MAGEA genes is associated with tumorigenesis. The MAGEA3 gene is approximately 2.4 kb long and contains six exons and five introns. The predicted protein contains five domains (P-loop, Walker A, ATP-binding, magnesium-binding, and C-terminal) and one half-domain. The gene product contains a large N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain. The MAGEA3 protein is a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, which is involved in the transcription of DNA. The protein is also a component of the RNA polymerase II-FT complex, which is involved in the formation of the spliceosome. The RNA polymerase II holoenzyme is a large protein complex that contains at least 17 different proteins. The holoenzyme is responsible for the transcription of DNA into RNA. The MAGEA3 protein is one of the non-Rpb proteins that are involved in the formation of the holoenzyme. The MAGEA3 protein is also a component of the RNA polymerase II-FT complex, which is involved in the formation of the spliceosome. The spliceosome is a large protein complex that is responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA. The spliceosome is formed by the association of several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and it contains a variety of protein subunits. The MAGEA3 protein is one of the non-snRNP proteins that are involved in the formation of the spliceosome. The MAGEA3 protein has been shown to be expressed in a variety of cancer cells, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. The protein has also been shown to be expressed in a variety of normal cells, including breast epithelial cells, colorectal epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells, and prostate epithelial cells. The expression of the MAGEA3 gene is regulated by a variety of factors, including transcription factors, hormones, and environmental cues. The expression of the MAGEA3 gene is also regulated by the activity of other genes, including the MAGEA1 gene, the MAGEA2 gene, the MAGEA4 gene, and the MAGEA5 gene.",

    " Australopithecus africanus is a species of the genus Australopithecus that lived from around 2.9 million years ago to around 2.3 million years ago. It is known from a single type specimen, discovered in a lime mine at Sterkfontein, South Africa, in the 1930s, as well as from other fossils found at the same site in the 1970s and 1990s. A. africanus is a possible ancestor of modern humans, as it is known to be bipedal and was once considered to be the first known species to have used stone tools (this is now known to have been done by the earlier species Homo habilis). It is also thought to be the first species to have used fire. The type specimen, known as StW 573, is a single, incomplete skeleton of a juvenile male. StW 573 was discovered in a chamber of the Sterkfontein caves in 1936 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson, and was the first early hominid fossil to be discovered in South Africa. After its discovery, the species was originally described as a member of the genus Homo, and was named as Homo africanus by Robinson in 1944. However, it was later realised that the species was more similar to the genus of the original type specimen, Australopithecus, and was reclassified as such in 1946. Further research has shown that the species is likely to be intermediate between the bipedal but otherwise chimpanzee-like Australopithecus afarensis and the fully human genus Homo, and as such its name has been changed to Australopithecus africanis. A. africanus is thought to have been similar to A. afarensis in body size, but with a more compact and less elongated skull, and with the facial region less projecting and the brow region more vertical. The face is relatively flat, with large brow-ridges and large molar teeth. Postcranially, it is characterised by a long, barrel-shaped torso, short, robust arms, and a relatively long, low femur. Several other fossils from the same site have been found to be conspecific with the type specimen, including the 1995 discovery of a partial skeleton, StW 578, which was the first fossil to be found in the same chamber as the type specimen. The site of the find, in Chamber B of the Sterkfontein cave system, is considered to be a unique area for palaeontological research, as the caves have preserved many fragile fossils that would otherwise have been destroyed. A. africanus is thought to have lived between 2.9 million years ago and 2.3 million years ago. It was a contemporary of the species Homo habilis, and may have been its ancestor. It is also thought to be a possible ancestor of the species Homo rudolfensis, which lived around the same time in East Africa. A. africanus is thought to have been a scavenger, but possibly also a hunter, as it is known to have used stone tools. It is also thought to be the first known species to have used fire.",
    " The Australasian treecreeper (Climacteris affinis) is a species of treecreeper in the genus Climacteris, in the family Pardalotidae. It is found in Australia and New Guinea. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is a small, brown, ground-dwelling bird. The adult has a length of 11 to 13 cm (4.3 to 5.1 in), a wing length of 6.5 to 8 cm (2.6 to 3.1 in) and a weight of 8 to 9 g (0.28 to 0.35 oz). The bill is dark grey, long and slender. The legs and feet are pale grey. The head is grey with a pale, white cheek patch. The upper body is dark chocolate brown to black, with the feathers having a slight gloss. The lower body is a lighter brown with a pale brown belly and white undertail coverts. The male and female are similar in appearance. The Australasian treecreeper is found in south-eastern Australia, from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to the New South Wales south coast, as well as in the Australian Capital Territory and the islands of Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It is also found in the lowlands of New Guinea. It is a common species and is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Australasian treecreeper is found in forest and woodland, as well as parks and gardens, where it feeds on the ground on ants and other small invertebrates. It can be seen hopping quickly on the ground, pecking at the surface to disturb prey. It can also be seen climbing trees, using its tail for support. The species is solitary, although several may be seen together where their territories overlap. It is territorial, with pairs defending a territory of 1,000 to 2,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) and engaging in displays to mark their territory. The Australasian treecreeper pairs with one partner for life. The nest is built by the female, and is a small, open cup made of twigs and lined with hair. It is usually located in the fork of a tree or in the corner of a building. The nest is sometimes reused in later years. Two or three eggs are laid, and are pale blue with brown spots. The eggs are incubated by the female for fourteen days, with the chicks being fed by both parents. The young birds leave the nest after fifteen days. The Australasian treecreeper is insectivorous, with ants making up a large part of the diet. It is sometimes known to take small fruits and seeds.",

    " Internal wave Internal waves are waves that propagate along the interface between two fluids of different densities. They are longitudinal waves, meaning that they propagate in the same direction as the energy they transport. They are quasilinear waves, meaning that they exhibit a certain degree of linearity, in that the displacement of the medium is related to the energy density in the wave by a simple formula, which is not the case for nonlinear waves. Internal waves are a type of wave that exists in a fluid that is completely surrounded by another fluid, and they are thus unable to escape the surrounding fluid. Internal waves can be generated by the movement of the fluids that surround them. An example is the internal waves that are generated when the Earth's upper ocean is influenced by the wind, or when a layer of fluid is displaced by a solid body that is moving through it. Internal waves are a type of gravity wave, meaning that they are influenced by the force of gravity, which acts between the two fluids. Internal waves are also influenced by the viscous forces that act between the two fluids. The viscous forces tend to dampen the waves, and they also tend to make the waves turbulent. The combination of the gravitational and viscous forces is what gives rise to the complex behavior of internal waves. Internal waves are important in a number of scientific fields, including oceanography, meteorology, and astrophysics. In the ocean, internal waves play an important role in the circulation of the upper ocean and in the mixing of the upper and lower layers of the ocean. In the atmosphere, internal waves are responsible for the transport of heat and moisture from the surface to the upper levels of the atmosphere. In astrophysics, internal waves are important in the circulation of fluids within the interiors of stars and planets, and they are also important in the transport of energy and matter through the interiors of these objects.

    " Slobodan Kaličanin (Serbian Cyrillic: Слободан Каличанин; born 11 January 1948) is a Serbian former politician and convicted war criminal. He was the founder and leader of the Serbian ultra-nationalist organization Tigers, which was responsible for a series of murders, torture and other crimes during the Yugoslav Wars. Kaličanin was born in 1948 in Niš, Serbia, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia, Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He was a student at the Niš Faculty of Technology until the early 1970s, but dropped out in his third year. In the late 1970s, he formed the Association of Non-Conformist Students, which soon transformed into the Serbian nationalist organization known as the Tigers. The Tigers' initial goal was to unite the various Serbian nationalist groups in Yugoslavia and create a Serbian superstate, which would include all of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and parts of Croatia. To achieve this, the Tigers conducted a series of murders, torture and other crimes against civilians, aiming to create a climate of fear and instability. The Tigers were also responsible for a number of political assassinations, including the murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić. In the late 1980s, the Tigers began to cooperate with the Yugoslav government, and Kaličanin was appointed to a number of government positions. However, the relationship between the Tigers and the government began to deteriorate in the early 1990s, as the Tigers began to pursue their own agenda, and the government began to move towards a more moderate position. In 1992, the Tigers were banned, and Kaličanin was forced to go into hiding. In the late 1990s, Kaličanin was arrested and tried for a number of crimes, including the murder of Đinđić. In 2002, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Kaličanin is currently serving his sentence at the maximum security prison in Beograd.",
    " The 1986 Philippine presidential election was held on February 7, 1986, pursuant to the 1986 Constitution. This was the first presidential election after the 1986 People Power Revolution, which saw the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos by Corazon Aquino. The election was held under a transitory provision in the 1986 Constitution, which was supposed to be the last election under the Fourth Philippine Republic. This was the first time that a presidential election was held using the plurality voting system, as the previous elections used first-past-the-post voting. The 1986 Constitution also did not allow political parties, which had been a feature of previous elections. The election was boycotted by the two major parties, the Kilusang Bagong Sibol (KBS) and the Lakas ng Bayan (Laban), who chose instead to support the National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), which was organizing an independent election. The two major parties did not put up any candidate for president or vice president. The election was won by Corazon Aquino, the first female president of the Philippines. Her running mate, Salvador Laurel, won the vice presidential election. This was the only time in Philippine history that the president and vice president were elected independently of each other.",
    " In mathematics, the projective line, also called the projective curve, is an algebraic curve in the projective plane, which is the space of all points in the plane no three of which are collinear. The projective line may be described as the set of all points which have the same configuration with respect to the planes defined by three given non-collinear points. More formally, the projective line may be defined as the set of points whose projective coordinates, when expressed in the basis of three given points, are all equal to one another. The projective line has a natural structure of a projective curve, but becomes an affine curve if we choose a basis in which three points are collinear. A projective line can be regarded as a projective generalization of a line in affine space. In the special case of a projective line in the real projective plane, we can choose a basis such that the real projective line is the set of all points whose first two coordinates are equal to each other and whose third coordinate is equal to zero. This special projective line is called the absolute projective line. A projective line is not in general the same as the set of all points on a line in affine space, because the projective line contains \"extra\" points which are not on any line in affine space. For example, the set of all points with two equal coordinates and one equal to zero contains, in addition to the points on any line in affine space, the \"extra\" point at infinity in the direction of the line. Projective lines can be used to defineprojective planes, projective spaces, and other geometric structures. In the theory of algebraic curves, the special case of a projective line is called a conic section. In the theory of complex projective spaces, the projective line is called a complex projective curve.",

    " Minor spliceosome The minor spliceosome is a group of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that play a key role in the removal of introns from minor (or alternative) splice variants of pre-mRNA. snRNPs form a complex with the intron-containing pre-mRNA and participate in the splicing reaction. The minor spliceosome is composed of at least three Sm-domain-containing proteins: SnRNP core protein SmD3, SmD2, and SmD1. It also contains two other proteins: SmB and SmE. The minor spliceosome is involved in the removal of introns that are located in positions of intron-exon boundaries that do not match the consensus sequence for splicing (i.e. the 5' end of the intron has a purine nucleotide instead of the usual pyrimidine nucleotide). The resulting minor splice variant of the pre-mRNA will often be translated into a protein that is structurally and/or functionally different from the major splice variant of the pre-mRNA. The minor spliceosome can also be involved in the generation of chimeric RNA molecules. Such RNA molecules contain sequences from two or more different mRNAs. In the case of the minor spliceosome, the chimeric RNA molecules are generated by a trans-splicing reaction, in which the two RNA molecules to be joined have compatible 3' and 5' splice sites. The function of the minor spliceosome can be explained by the following reaction scheme: The minor spliceosome catalyzes the splicing reaction in a similar manner as the major spliceosome. In the first step, the attacking splice site is chosen. In the second step, the bond between the two splice sites is cleaved. Then, in the third step, the intron is released, and in the fourth step, the two exons are ligated. The steps 2 and 3 are the rate-limiting steps in the minor spliceosome-catalyzed splicing reaction. The catalysis of these steps is highly specific and requires the presence of a variety of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The snRNAs are similar to the guide RNAs that are involved in the catalytic reaction of the major spliceosome. However, unlike the guide RNAs of the major spliceosome, the snRNAs of the minor spliceosome are not bound to a protein. The structure of the minor spliceosome has not been resolved experimentally. However, based on the conservation of sequence and structure of the Sm proteins, it has been proposed that the minor spliceosome forms a helical structure with the Sm proteins SmD3 and SmD2 forming a core that is surrounded by the Sm protein SmD1 and the snRNAs. In many cases, a particular pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to produce both major and minor splice variants. The decision which variant will be produced is often dependent on the cell type or the developmental stage of the cell. In such cases, the minor spliceosome can be in competition with the major spliceosome for the removal of the intron. In some cases, the minor spliceosome is the dominant splicing pathway, whereas in other cases the major spliceosome is the dominant splicing pathway.",

    " The Nordic model The Nordic model is a concept in social and political theory corresponding to the labour market and welfare system of the Nordic countries ( Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). The model is characterized by a combination of a highly developed welfare state with a market-based economy. In the 1980s, the concept was brought to the attention of a wider audience by the American political scientist Robert K. Merton, who praised the Nordic model as a way to achieve both economic efficiency and social justice. The Nordic model combines a centralized, collective bargaining-based labor market with a highly progressive taxation system and a generous welfare state. The result is a system where wages and working conditions are determined through collective bargaining between trade unions and employers. Wages are standardized to prevent labor market segmentation and to encourage internal labor migration. The Nordic model has been associated with a number of specific policies. In the labor market, these include a centralized system of collective bargaining, wage-setting, and standardized contracts; a Nordic-style occupational classification; a dual education system with both academic and vocational tracks; and a high level of union membership. In the welfare state, the Nordic model is associated with a comprehensive social security system that includes health care, unemployment benefits, and a system of family leave; a high level of public spending on education; and a policy of \"active labor market policy\" to help the unemployed find jobs. The Nordic model has been praised for its combination of economic efficiency and social justice. It has also been praised for its positive effect on gender equality and its promotion of social mobility. However, the Nordic model has also been criticized for its high level of income inequality and for its failure to address the problem of unemployment.",

    " François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre (1613 – 1680) was a 17th-century French writer who is best known for his maxims, which are listed in his book, Les Maximes du Marquis de Montandre. La Rochefoucauld was born in Paris, the son of Etienne de La Rochefoucauld, a fidalgo, or member of the nobility of the household of the King of France, and of Judith de Lencel, daughter of a Protestant family from the south of France. His mother was the sister of the mathematician and physicist Étienne Pascal. After his father's death in 1629, he and his mother and brother lived with their cousin, the philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal had a great influence on La Rochefoucauld and his writing. La Rochefoucauld attended the University of Paris and completed his studies in 1633. He then served as an officer in the French army until 1646. He married his first wife, Catherine de Ligneris, in 1644, and his second wife, Jacqueline de La Vergenne, in 1651. He became the Marquis de Montandre in 1666. Montandre had many friends and acquaintances among the literary and intellectual elite of his day, including the writers Molière, La Fontaine, and Jean de Santeuil; the historians Louis de Beaufort and Louis Bergeron; and the philosophers Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, and Nicolas Malebranche. His first published work was a collection of Latin poems, entitled La Lyre des Amants (The Lyre of Lovers), which appeared in 1639. His maxims were first published in 1665, under the title Les Maximes du Marquis de Montandre, but were later renamed Les Maximes de la Rochefoucauld. The maxims are a collection of approximately 500 epigrammatic statements that express such ideas as \"Vanity is the foundation of all wisdom\" and \"We would often be cured of our passions if we could have them at will.\" The maxims have been compared to the philosophy of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides and the ancient Roman philosopher Seneca. La Rochefoucauld's work had a profound impact on the literature of the 17th century, and his maxims are often quoted in modern times.",

    " Sampling (music) Sampling is the selection and manipulation of a short section of a sound recording and the use of that section as a musical element. Sampling is a form of interpolation; the sample is inserted into the new recording at the selected speed, and its pitch is optionally adjusted to match that of the other elements of the new recording. The process is also called \"lifting\" or \"ripping\" a sample. Sampling is used creatively in all genres of music, from hip hop to pop to dance to rock, and has been part of music production since the 1940s. In the early 1990s, sampling was recognized as a new art form in itself. The sample may be from a digital or analog source. Analog sampling requires analog-to-digital conversion. Digital sampling requires no analog-to-digital conversion. Sampling was originally accomplished by recording the desired sample to a second analog track on a multitrack analog tape recorder. The original source was then re-recorded, with the sample played simultaneously with the new source, to a third analog track. The sample would be blended with the new source, and both would be re-recorded to a fourth track, and so on. During the mixing stage, as much of the original recorded source would be faded out as desired, leaving only the sample. The use of sampling has generally increased throughout the history of music production. It has been suggested that this is because musicians are sampling other musicians' work and using it to create their own. In the 1940s, 1950s, and early-1960s, sampling was accomplished by simply using a portable analog tape player and feeding its output into a second tape recorder. The original source was then re-recorded, with the sample played simultaneously with the new source, to a third analog track. The sample would be blended with the new source, and both would be re-recorded to a fourth track, and so on. During the mixing stage, as much of the original recorded source would be faded out as desired, leaving only the sample.

    " The album You've Got a Friend was a commercial success, and its title track, which she had written for her friend James Taylor, became her first big hit. Her follow-up album, Tapestry, was an even greater success, spending 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard album chart and winning four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. King has since released 24 studio albums, as well as five live albums, four compilation albums, and four extended plays. In 1961, King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, signed a songwriting deal with Don Kirshner's Aldon Music, which was the music division of Aldon Pictures. Through this deal, they wrote more than two dozen songs for Aldon's in-house artists, including Bobby Vee, the Everly Brothers, and Little Eva. In 1962, King and Goffin were hired by ABC-Paramount to write for their stable of artists, including Paul Anka, George Hamilton IV, and Tommy Sands. The following year they wrote for Columbia Pictures' film All American Co-Ed, which featured the hit title track, performed by Oklahoma! star Gordon MacRae. In late 1964, Goffin and King were signed by Songery, a publishing company founded by singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka. The following year, they began working with singer-songwriter Barry Mann, who was also signed to Songery. The trio's first collaboration, \"Goin' Back to Liverpool\", was recorded by the British Invasion band the Searchers. Other hits written by the trio include \"I'm into Something Good\", \"You've Got Your Love\", \"I Will Follow Him\", and \"One Fine Morning\". After Songery's collapse in 1966, King and Goffin signed a new songwriting deal with Screen Gems. The following year they divorced, and King began a solo career. In 1970, King released her first solo album, Writer, which consisted mostly of her own compositions. Her follow-up album, Tapestry, was an even greater success, spending 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard album chart and winning four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The title track, \"You've Got a Friend\", became her first big hit. In 1971, King released Music, which was less successful than her previous albums but still had two hit singles: \"You've Got a Friend\" and \"Where You Lead\". The following year she released Rhymes & Reasons, which contained the hit \"The Locomotion\". Her 1974 album, Wrap Around Joy, was her last with ABC and included the hit \"I Feel the Earth Move\".

    " Papilio hyppason, the tailed emperor, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. The tailed emperor is the largest butterfly in the African continent. The male is 60–80 mm in wingspan and the female is a slightly larger 80–95 mm. The male is smaller than the female, but has a longer tail. The body is quite hairy, and the abdomen is barred with grey and yellow. The head has a row of black spots and the antennae are pale. The male has an iridescent purple-blue abdomen and the female's abdomen is banded with brown, cream and white. The dorsal sides of the wings are brown with red-orange highlights and a row of black spots. The ventral sides are brown with small tails, and a row of black spots that are larger in the male than in the female. The tailed emperor is found from South Africa to Kenya and Tanzania, and further north to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a forest species, occurring in primary forests, but also in secondary forests and forest gaps. It is found at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1500 metres. The tailed emperor is a solitary, territorial butterfly. Both sexes mud-puddle, and the male also engages in hill-topping. The male's territorial display consists of steep, spiralling flights, with the butterfly rising up to 15 metres in a few seconds, then gliding back down to the ground. The male will pursue any other butterfly that enters its territory, sometimes attacking butterflies as large as the African giant swallowtail. The tailed emperor has been observed mud-puddling in large groups. The butterfly also browses on sap, and visits flowers for nectar. It has also been observed feeding from dead carcasses. The male's territoriality and lek-mating system make the tailed emperor a model species for the study of sexual selection. The male's courtship display includes the usual wing-quivering and -waving, as well as the unique 'high-dive'. The male will take off from a high perch and dive steeply, sometimes up to 30 metres, then glide back to the ground. This is repeated several times. The male's 'high-dive' was featured on the BBC's programme, Planet Earth. The tailed emperor is a common butterfly in urban and suburban areas, and can be seen flying around streets and settlements. It is one of the most common species seen by travellers to the African continent. The species is fairly adaptable, and is able to utilize new urban and suburban areas. The tailed emperor is a member of the 'emperor' tribe of butterflies, named for their distinctive wing shape. The common name is derived from the long tails of the hindwings. The family Nymphalidae is the largest family of butterflies, and includes the danaids, the satyrs, and the nymphs.",

    " Calvin–Hope men's basketball rivalry The Calvin–Hope men's basketball rivalry is a college basketball rivalry between the Calvin Knights and the Hope Flying Dutchmen. The two teams have faced each other twice every year since 1960. Calvin College and Hope College are both located in Michigan, approximately 35 miles (56 km) apart. The schools are both private, four-year institutions with similar student enrollments (Calvin: 3,400; Hope: 3,200) and religious roots. The schools are also both members of the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and the two men's basketball teams have been the MIAA's most successful programs since the turn of the millennium. The rivalry has been characterized by intense competition, close games, and a friendly rivalry between the two schools off the court. The rivalry was listed by Sports Illustrated as one of the 20 biggest rivalries in college basketball. In 2002, the teams combined to sell out every regular-season game at both schools' arenas. The two teams have won a combined 19 MIAA regular-season titles since 1996, including 15 by Calvin.

    " Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (Kenya) The Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project is an irrigation project in Kenya, on the Tana River in the Coast Province. It was initiated in the late 1970s, and the first phase was completed in 1988. The project has two components, the irrigation scheme and the settlement scheme. The irrigation scheme involves the construction of a dam on the Tana River, which will provide water for irrigation to farmers in the Tana River District. The settlement scheme involves the construction of a new town, which will provide housing for the farmers who will be displaced by the irrigation scheme. The project has been criticized for its environmental impact, and for its potential to cause social dislocation. The dam will flood a large area of the Tana River, and will change the way of life for many people who live along the river. The new town will also have a significant impact on the landscape, and will require the displacement of many people. The project is being implemented by the Kenya Sugar Board, and is being funded by the government of Kenya and by the World Bank.",

    " Megaupload legal case On 19 January 2012, the United States Department of Justice charged seven individuals and two companies, Megaupload and Megavideo, with criminal copyright infringement. The companies' two principal owners, Kim Dotcom and his wife Mona, were arrested in New Zealand on 20 January 2012. The investigation into Megaupload began in 2008, when the company's website was used to store and distribute a pirated copy of the film The Hurt Locker. In 2010, an investigator took advantage of Megaupload's policy of giving free storage space to users who uploaded a large number of files, and uploaded a large number of files himself, none of which were copyright-infringing. This allowed the investigator to download the rest of the files on the site without any copyright-infringing material, and he identified several other copyrighted works that had been uploaded to the site. In August 2010, the FBI obtained a search warrant to enter the residences of Dotcom and his colleagues, but delayed the execution of the search warrant to avoid potential diplomatic complications, as Dotcom's residence was in New Zealand, a country with which the United States has an extradition treaty. The FBI obtained additional warrants to search the Megaupload corporate offices in Hong Kong and the Megavideo corporate offices in the United States. On 9 February 2012, Dotcom's lawyers filed a \"Notice of Intention to Stand on Defective Search Warrant\" in New Zealand. On 17 February 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that the search warrants were invalid, as the court had not been presented with evidence of criminal copyright infringement. As a result, the New Zealand government officially returned the seized property to Dotcom. On 20 February 2012, the U.S. government filed a request with the New Zealand government to extradite Dotcom. In July 2012, the New Zealand government rejected the request, citing that the United States had not provided enough information to extradite Dotcom, and that Dotcom's arrest had been improper. On 24 August 2012, the United States launched a second request for Dotcom's extradition. In December 2012, New Zealand granted the United States' request, and Dotcom's legal team launched a second appeal. On 17 April 2013, the New Zealand Court of Appeal ruled that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States. Dotcom's legal team stated that they would file a further appeal with the New Zealand Supreme Court. In February 2013, the United States Department of Justice had stated that it was working to have Dotcom returned to the United States, and that \"the proper thing to do is for New Zealand to extradite Mr. Dotcom to the United States.\"",

    " Windhorse (film) Windhorse is a 1993 American drama film directed by Carroll Ballard and starring Richard Harris, Robert Wisdom, and Jeremy Irons. The film is based on the life of Frank Farmar, a horse trainer and jockey who, after suffering a career-ending injury, turned to training racehorses. The film is set in the horse racing industry in general and the sport of Steeplechase racing in particular. The title refers to the \"wind horse,\" or \"invisible horse\" in Tibetan culture, a concept of happiness and good fortune, and the horse that carries the wind. Frank Farmar (Wisdom) is a gifted jockey and horse trainer whose career is ended by a serious fall. He begins training racehorses for wealthy businessman Sir Henry Lee (Irons), but the emotionally damaged Farmar is unable to take pleasure in his work. In a desperate attempt to regain his love for life, he decides to breed and train his own horse, despite his lack of money and resources. Farmar becomes emotionally attached to a young horse he names Windhorse, and his journey to heal himself is paralleled with the horse's own journey to recover from a broken leg. Windhorse was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. The film's theme song, \"This House,\" was written and performed by Bruce Hornsby. The film was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on September 27, 2005. Carroll Ballard later directed a television series based on the film, also called Windhorse, which premiered on CBS in 1998.

    " A Fable for Critics is a poem by James Boswell that ridicules the artificiality and excessive reliance on literary devices of the 18th-century British school of poetry, in particular that of Samuel Johnson and his circle. The title is a reference to Aesop's Fables, and the work is accordingly composed of a collection of 18 \"fables\" which are lightly veiled satires of the fashionable literary genres of the day. The genres targeted include the \"epistle\", the \"song\", the \"epic\" and the \"tragedy\", with the deadpan moral to each fable delivered in the style of the original. In the poem, Boswell ridicules the contemporary fashion for heightened sentiment and orotundity, andasters such as Johnson and his circle with their obsession for all things classical and their pedantic coterie. In the process, Boswell reveals himself to be, in the words of one critic, \"a young man with a very high opinion of his own abilities and a very low one of other people's\". The poem was never published during Boswell's lifetime, and the only known copy was lost in the 1920s. It was eventually published in the 1950s, after a single leaf of the text was discovered in the back of a copy of The Works of Samuel Johnson, a 19th-century edition. This leaf was sold in 1952 to a private buyer by the London bookseller Harold Mortlake, and the buyer had it bound with another 18th-century poem, \"The Life of an Author\", also allegedly by Boswell. This copy was sold by the same bookseller to the British Library in 1956. A typescript of the poem was also sold to the Scottish historian William Teeling in the 1950s, and this was eventually donated to the University of Aberdeen.",
    " Benthem v Netherlands (Court of Justice of the EU) Benthem v Netherlands was a case heard by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on 11 November 2008. The case concerned the right of Dutch citizens to challenge legislation passed by the Dutch Parliament, and the relationship between the EU's legislative procedure and that of its member states. The case was initiated by Vera Benthem, a Dutch citizen, who challenged the constitutionality of the EU's Treaty of Nice, which had been passed into Dutch law in 2003. Benthem argued that the treaty, which was designed to amend the EU's institutions in preparation for the introduction of a Constitution, had been improperly adopted by the Dutch Parliament. She claimed that the treaty lacked a sufficient number of votes in favour of its adoption, and that the procedure used for its passage had been invalid. The Court of Amsterdam initially heard the case, and found in favour of Benthem, ruling that the Treaty of Nice was unconstitutional and that its adoption had been improper. The Dutch Government subsequently appealed to the CJEU. In its judgment, the CJEU held that the Treaty of Nice had been validly adopted by the Dutch Parliament, and that the procedure used for its adoption had been in line with the requirements of Dutch law. The Court further held that, while Dutch citizens did have the right to challenge the constitutionality of legislation passed by the Dutch Parliament, this could only be done within a limited time period, and that Benthem's challenge had been brought outside of this period. The case is significant as it is one of the first in which the CJEU has ruled on the relationship between the EU's legislative procedure and that of its member states, and on the right of citizens to challenge the constitutionality of legislation passed by their national parliaments.",
    " The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, also known as the Brunhes–Matuyama transition, was a planetary-scale reversal of the Earth's magnetic field that occurred relatively recently in the Earth's history, approximately 774,000 years ago. The event has been dated to the abrupt onset of the Matuyama period, an interval of reversed polarity in the Earth's magnetic field, which has lasted until the present day. The Earth's magnetic field is a vector quantity, characterized by both strength and direction, and is a result of the convection currents in the Earth's liquid core. The Earth's core has an internal magnetic field that is approximately equal in strength to the field observed on the Earth's surface. However, the direction of the internal magnetic field is opposite to that of the surface field: the north magnetic pole is located in the Earth's south, and vice versa. The Earth's field is the result of the interaction of the internal field with the surface field, and is characterized by a number of different components. The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal is the most recent magnetic reversal of the Earth's surface field. The previous reversal, the Olduvai event, occurred approximately 1.5 million years ago. There have been at least 100 reversals in the last 70 million years. The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal was first identified in 1906 by the French geophysicist Bernard Brunhes. Brunhes discovered the event by studying the magnetic properties of samples of volcanic rocks from the Pacific coast of Japan, which had been collected during a Japanese expedition to the Bonin Islands in 1895. The samples were of the right age to be associated with the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, and the reversal was eventually confirmed by the measurement of the magnetic properties of other rocks and sediments. The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal is of particular interest because it corresponds to a period of dramatic climate change, including a number of rapid and intense glacial episodes. The reversal also corresponds to a period of increased volcanic activity, and a number of large volcanic eruptions have been dated to the Brunhes–Matuyama period. The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal is thought to have been caused by a process of secular variation, in which the Earth's magnetic field slowly changes in strength and direction over time. The secular variation is thought to be driven by the convection currents in the Earth's core, which are in turn driven by the heat from the Earth's interior. The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal was a particularly intense episode of secular variation, and the sudden change in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field had a number of dramatic effects on the Earth's climate and environment.",
    " A chromatrope is an optical instrument that reflects a continuously moving spectrum of colors. It is sometimes called a \"color top\" or a \"rainbow top.\" The chromatrope consists of a disk or a drum-shaped object with a series of holes or slits in the circumference. The holes are evenly spaced around the disk, and each hole has a different color. The disk is mounted on a rotating shaft. When the chromatrope is rotated, the holes or slits allow the user to view a continuously moving spectrum of colors. The speed of the moving spectrum can be controlled by adjusting the speed of the rotation. The chromatrope can be used as a scientific instrument to study the properties of light, or as a decorative item. It is often used as a demonstration tool in physics classrooms to show the separation of light into its constituent colors. The chromatrope is similar to the spectroscope, which is used to analyze the spectrum of light from a distant source. However, the chromatrope is used to generate a spectrum, rather than to analyze one.",

    " Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate using NADP+ as a cofactor. This enzyme, along with its substrate and cofactor, is involved in the citric acid cycle, specifically in the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate. This reduction is necessary in order to maintain the balance of the cycle, as the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA results in the production of oxaloacetate. The enzyme is found in the cytosol of mesophyll cells in plants, and in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle in animals. In plant cells, MDH is involved in the anaplerotic reaction which produces oxaloacetate from acetyl-CoA. This reaction is part of the glyoxylate bypass, which allows the formation of glucose from carbon dioxide in the absence of a functional glycolytic pathway. In animals, the MDH found in skeletal muscle is involved in the breakdown of glucose to produce lactate, which is necessary for the contractile function of muscles. This breakdown is known as glycolysis, and the energy released is used to fuel the movements of the body. The enzyme is a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two identical subunits. Each subunit has a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. It is also a membrane-associated protein, meaning that it is bound to the plasma membrane of the cell. In the plant enzyme, this binding is via a transit peptide, which is a short amino acid sequence that directs the enzyme to the plasma membrane. In the animal enzyme, however, the binding is more loosely defined, and the enzyme may also be found in the cytosol. The primary structure of malate dehydrogenase is very similar across species, although there are some differences. The enzyme is a decamer, meaning it is composed of ten amino acid chains. The primary sequence of these chains is as follows, with the bold letters representing the amino acids that are identical to the consensus sequence: [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]-[F]-[G]-[H]-[I]-[J] The secondary structure of the enzyme is also similar across species, although the loops of the protein are usually different. The secondary structure of the enzyme is as follows: The active site of the enzyme is located at the C-terminal end, and it is here that the substrate binds to the enzyme. The active site contains a large number of negatively-charged amino acids, which are necessary for the binding of the positively-charged substrate. The enzyme is activated by the binding of NADP+, which is the cofactor for the reaction. This binding results in the formation of a complex between the enzyme and the cofactor. The complex is then able to bind to the substrate and catalyze the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate. The enzyme is also regulated by the levels of the substrate and the cofactor in the cell. In plants, the enzyme is typically activated by the increase in light intensity, which results in the increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the cell. In animals, the enzyme is typically activated by the increase in the levels of lactate in the cell.",
    " Luke Rhinehart (born 1930) is an American writer and physician best known for his novel The Dice Man, a fictionalized autobiography about a psychiatrist who, as part of an experiment, embarks on a journey of self-discovery by making decisions based on the roll of a die. Born in Germany, Rhinehart was raised in the United States and attended college at the University of Wisconsin. He then attended medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. He completed his residency in New York City and fellowship in London. After residency, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, where he studied the effects of radiation on mice. In 1967, after two years of research, he left the Public Health Service to write fiction full-time. His first works were two novels, The Book of the Die and The Concrete River, neither of which were commercially successful. In 1970, he published The Dice Man, which became a surprise bestseller. The book's title refers to the die that the narrator uses to make decisions, and the story is a fictionalized autobiography. The book was a critical success and was adapted into a movie starring Richard Dreyfuss. In 1978, he published the novel The Search, which was not as commercially successful as The Dice Man, but was critically acclaimed. In 1982, he published the non-fiction book, The Book of Lists, which was a collection of lists that he had created for his own personal use. In 1984, he published the novel, Whack Job, which was a return to the style of The Dice Man and was also commercially successful. In addition to his novels, Rhinehart has also written several volumes of short stories, as well as a collection of essays.",

    " The Lancaster Inferno was a professional soccer team based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania that played in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), the third tier of the American soccer pyramid. The team was founded in 2007 and folded in 2013. The Lancaster Inferno played in the NPSL's Northeast Division from 2007 to 2010, and in the NPSL's Mid-Atlantic Division from 2011 to 2013. The team's home field was War Memorial Stadium. The Inferno was founded by Neil Sider, a native of Manchester, England, who came to the United States in 1987. Sider was involved with the Manchester City Football Club for many years, and was the owner and operator of the City of Manchester Pub in Philadelphia. The Inferno had a sister organization, the Pennsylvania Roar, that played in the WPSL from 2008 to 2010. The Lancaster Inferno had a team philosophy of playing \"old-school\" British football, and emphasized \"passing the ball on the ground, and through the air, to feet.\" The team's style was \"positively different\" from the \"kick and rush\" style that is more common in American soccer. The Inferno also had a reputation for playing \"heavy metal\" music at its home matches, with songs such as \"Born to Run\", \"Back in Black\", \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Enter Sandman\" blaring over the loudspeakers. The team also had a \"Fan Cam\" at home matches, with fans holding up cards with the letter \"I\" on them. The Inferno was the first team in the NPSL to have a live band perform at its home matches. The band, called \"The Burn\", played for the team's home matches in 2011 and 2012. The Inferno had an official supporter group, called the \"Lancaster Old School Supporters Club\", or \"L.O.S.S.C.\". The L.O.S.S.C. was founded in 2007, and had a membership of over 100 people.

    " Short-path distillation is a method of distillation in which the distillate is produced in a single pass. The short path is achieved by boiling the feedstock in the presence of a carrier gas in a heated chamber. The short boiling time (which can be as short as 0.01 seconds) allows the distillate to be produced in a single pass. The short-path distillation is used for the purification of thermally unstable substances, such as thermally unstable polymers, antibiotics, and organometallic compounds, which cannot be purified by conventional distillation because of the long residence time in the distillation column. Short-path distillation can also be used for the separation of thermally stable substances, such as isotopically enriched compounds, which can be separated by conventional distillation, but with a lower efficiency. The reason for the lower efficiency is the formation of azeotropic mixtures. The short-path distillation has the advantage that the distillate is produced in a single pass, and therefore the azeotropic mixture is not formed. The short-path distillation can be used for the purification of substances, which can be distilled at atmospheric pressure without the formation of a decomposition product. In this case, the distillate is produced in a single pass, and the purity of the distillate is higher than that produced by conventional distillation. The short-path distillation can be used for the separation of substances, which can be distilled at atmospheric pressure, and the boiling temperature of which is higher than the decomposition temperature. In this case, the distillate is produced in a single pass, and the purity of the distillate is higher than that produced by conventional distillation.",
    " Lieutenant-general A lieutenant-general (lt-gen) is a general officer in the British Army, Royal Marines or Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom. The rank is also used in the British Army and Royal Marines reserve forces. The equivalent rank in the Royal Navy is rear-admiral (rd-adml) and in the Royal Air Force is air vice-marshal (av-mstr). The British Army and Royal Marines have a two-tier general officer structure: general officers (i.e. general, lieutenant-general, major-general, and captain) and field officers (i.e. major, lieutenant-colonel, colonel, and brigadier). The rank of lieutenant-general is equivalent to a one-star general officer; the other general officers are two- and three-star ranks. The Royal Air Force has no lieutenant-general rank, but its Royal Air Force Air Cadets organisation does. The origins of the lieutenant-general rank are complex. In the 17th century, the major was the second-in-command of a regiment and the lieutenant-colonel was the third-in-command. During the 18th century, the rank of lieutenant-colonel was elevated to that of colonel, the former rank being renamed lieutenant-colonel. However, the term lieutenant-colonel was used in a different context, to denote the second-in-command of a regiment, until the middle of the 18th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms lieutenant-colonel and colonel were used interchangeably, both meaning the second-in-command of a regiment. The British Army introduced the rank of lieutenant-colonel in replace of that of major in Cavalry and Indian regiments in 1856, and in the British, King's (later Royal) Army, in 1871. In 1877, the British Army introduced the ranks of lieutenant-colonel and colonel in the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. The Royal Marines had already been using these two ranks since the 1840s. The Royal Air Force did not have a rank of lieutenant-colonel equivalent until the Second World War, when it was used in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The Royal New Zealand Air Force had a rank of lieutenant-colonel from 1942 to 1968. The lieutenant-general is a senior officer rank, generally equivalent to the American military rank of lieutenant colonel in the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps. It is also comparable to the rank of captain in the other uniformed services of the United States, and to the rank of first mate in the British Royal Navy. In the British Army and Royal Marines, the rank of lieutenant-general can also be awarded as a military dignity, in which case it is not a rank, but an appointment, and the holder does not formally outrank other general officers. A lieutenant-general in this case is an officer of the rank of major-general, but holding the position of second-in-command of a major formation (such as a division or an aircraft carrier). The holder of the position of lieutenant-general is generally a highly experienced officer of the rank of major-general, and will have held the position of major-general for some years. The equivalent military dignity in the Royal Air Force is air commodore. The air commodore is not a rank but an appointment, and the holder does not formally outrank other officers of the rank of group captain. An air commodore is normally a group captain, but holds the position of second-in-command of a group (such as a Royal Air Force group, which is equivalent to an army division, or a Royal Air Force station, which is equivalent to a Royal Navy ship). The Royal Air Force Air Cadets has the military rank of lieutenant-general (LTGEN) for officers of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch) of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets. The Royal Air Force Air Cadets also has the military rank of air commodore (AIRCDRE) for officers of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch) of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets.",

    " Kentucky Gold The gold deposits in the United States were mostly discovered during the 19th century, while the metal was becoming a standard for currency and economic value. The first documented gold discovery in the United States was in North Carolina in 1799. The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, California, in 1848 sparked the California Gold Rush, the largest gold rush in United States history. The first discovery of gold in what is now the state of Kentucky was in the late 18th century, but the gold deposits were not mined until the 19th century. The first mine was opened at Gold Hill, near Mount Pleasant, in the early 1800s. The first gold rush in Kentucky was in the 1830s, and by 1840, the state was producing more gold than any other state except for Georgia. The most famous gold mine in Kentucky was the Sloss Mines, which were located in the town of Sloss, in the southeastern part of the state. The Sloss Mines were the largest gold mine in the state, and they produced more than $40 million worth of gold. The mine closed in the early 20th century, and the town of Sloss was eventually abandoned. There are still gold mines in Kentucky, but most of them are small, independent operations. The state is no longer a major gold producer, but it still has a rich history of gold mining.",
    " An ordinary course of business is an activity that is consistent with the ordinary and usual manner in which a corporation or other business entity conducts its business. An act or omission is said to be an ordinary course of business if it is an activity that is commonly engaged in by similar enterprises, and is not extraordinary or unusual. The term is often used in connection with a claim for insurance coverage. The ordinary course of business may also refer to the common practice of a particular business, and may be used as a defense to a claim of unfair competition. In insurance law, the term \"ordinary course of business\" is often used to describe the operations of a business that are routine or typical for that type of business. For example, the insurance company may cover a claim if the damage or loss was caused by the ordinary course of business, but may not cover a claim if the damage or loss was caused by something exceptional, or outside the usual course of business. The term \"ordinary course of business\" may also be used in contract law, to indicate that a particular act or omission was consistent with the ordinary course of business, and therefore did not constitute a breach of contract. For example, if a business contract requires a company to deliver goods to a customer by a certain date, and the company delivers the goods after the due date, this may be considered a breach of contract. However, if the company can show that the late delivery was due to an extraordinary circumstance, and was not part of the ordinary course of business, the company may be able to avoid liability for breach of contract.",

    " Buried (performance art) Buried is an artwork by the British artist Marc Quinn. In 2011, Quinn presented a performance entitled Buried, in which he was buried for three days. The performance was in reaction to a piece by the British artist Damien Hirst, in which a cow was buried in formaldehyde in a clear tank. Quinn's piece was a statement against the waste and spectacle he felt Hirst's work represented. Quinn buried himself on the grounds of his London studio on 10 October 2011, at the same time that Hirst's cow was being buried at the Serpentine Gallery in London. In addition to a text by Quinn explaining the work, the only other items buried with him were a copy of the Quran, a Bible, and a copy of the Lotus Sutra.

The Bush Doctrine was controversial and was the subject of widespread criticism, even within the United States. The Bush Doctrine was a significant shift in the foreign policy of the United States. For much of its history, the United States had a \"no first strike\" policy, which held that the United States would not initiate a nuclear strike against another country. This policy was a response to the beginning of the nuclear age, and was influenced by the experience of the First and Second World Wars. The Bush Doctrine, however, was a \"first strike\" policy, which gave the United States the right to initiate a war if it determined that a potential enemy state was developing nuclear weapons. The Bush Doctrine was first articulated in a speech by President Bush in October 2002. In the speech, Bush stated that the United States would take \"preemptive action\" against countries that were developing nuclear weapons. He also stated that the United States would take \"preventive action\" against countries that were harboring or supporting terrorist organizations. The Bush Doctrine was further clarified in a document released by the White House in January 2003. The document, known as the National Security Strategy, stated that the United States would take \"preemptive action\" against countries that were developing weapons of mass destruction, or that were harboring or supporting terrorist organizations.",

    " Peggs Green is a small village in the parish of South Mimms, in the east of Hertfordshire, England. It is located on the B158 road, and is situated approximately one mile (1.6 km) north-west of South Mimms, and two miles (3.2 km) south of Potters Bar. It is in the council ward of South Mimms, which is represented by two Conservative councillors. Peggs Green is a small village with a modern housing development, a parade of shops, and a historic pub. It is also home to the Mimms Hall stately home and accompanying Mimms Park. The place-name Peggs Green is first mentioned in a conveyance of 18th century, in which it is spelled as Peg's Green. The origin of the name is not known, but a local resident has suggested that it may be derived from the name of a Mr Peg, who was a landowner in the area. There is a story that the village was once a location for a number of public houses, and the neighbouring Mimms Hall was the location of a number of inns. The current public house, the Rising Sun, is a 19th-century building, but it is said that an earlier building on the site was once the residence of a Mr Smith, a farmer. The farm buildings were located where the modern housing development is situated. The village has an active Residents' Association, which organises various events throughout the year.",
    " Sir Hugo Sir Hugo (died 1356), was an English medieval knight. He is best known for killing the 13th-century Scottish rebel William Wallace in a duel. In 1356, King Edward III of England led a campaign in Scotland to put an end to the First War of Scottish Independence. On 22 June, the English forces defeated the Scots at the Battle of Aberdeen, and shortly afterwards captured the Scottish leader William Wallace. According to the Brut, a 15th-century chronicler, Wallace was sentenced to death by hanging. However, a knight named Sir Hugo, or Huon, asked that Wallace be given to him, as he had sworn to kill the Scottish leader. The chronicler goes on to say that: * 1) Sir Hugo (died 1356), an English medieval knight. * 2) Sir Hugo (died 1406), an English medieval knight. * 3) Sir Hugo (died 1471), an English medieval knight. \"And so it was granted him, to do his will in him, and he should hang him up naked, and should cut off his genitals, and should put them into his mouth, and so to kill him.\" The execution took place near Smithfield, London. The story of Wallace's execution by being fed his own genitals is a later fabrication, probably made in the 16th century. It is not mentioned in any contemporary account, and is not supported by the evidence of the 1405 letter from the Scottish knight Alexander de Bosse. Sir Hugo is believed to have been a member of the Deyncourts family, which had strong connections with the Scottish court. The execution of Wallace was probably a revenge killing, as the Scottish leader had killed Sir William de Deyncourt in the early stages of the war. Several sources give the first name of Sir Hugo as \"Henry\". However, the executioner is commonly given as \"Sir Henry de Lascy\", which may be a mistake for \"Sir Hugo de Lascy\". There is no direct evidence that Sir Hugo was a knight, as the only reference to his status comes from the 15th-century chronicler. However, it is likely that he was a knight, as it would be unusual for a non-knight to be granted such a grisly execution. The chronicler also states that Sir Hugo was \"a very tall man, but very lame\". After killing Wallace, Sir Hugo is said to have gone to the King's tent and cried out, \"I have done my deed, let me never be troubled more with the Scottish wars\". There is no record of Sir Hugo's subsequent career, and it is not known if he was present at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346, when the Scottish leader David II was captured. Sir Hugo is the subject of the traditional folk song, \"The Bonny Sir Hugo\". There are three known references to a \"Sir Hugo\" in the registers of the Order of the Garter in this period. However, it is not clear if any of these refer to the killer of Wallace. The first reference is to a \"Sir Hugo de Veer\", who was killed in a jousting tournament in 1347. The second is to a \"Sir Hugo de la Sluce\", who was present at the siege of Calais in 1347. The third reference is to a \"Sir Hugo, son of the Duke of Juliers\", who was made a knight of the Order of the Garter in 1349. It is unlikely that either of the first two references are to the same Hugo, as the records do not mention any children or heirs. It is possible that the third reference is to the son of the first Hugo. However, there are no known records of a \"Duke of Juliers\" or \"Duke of Jersey\" in this period, and the name \"Hugo\" does not appear in the list of sons of the counts of Juliers. It is possible that the chronicler has confused the name \"Hugo\" with \"Henry\", as the name Henry does appear among the counts of Juliers. It is also possible that the \"Duke of Juliers\" is a mistake for the \"Earl of Leicester\", as the chronicler describes Sir Hugo as \"a very tall man, but very lame\", and the Earl of Leicester was both tall and lame. In the 20th century, a street in Aberdeen was named after Sir Hugo. There is also a public house named after him in the city. The city of Aberdeen has a coat of arms which includes a figure of a hanged man, which is said to represent Wallace. However, as a result of the Victorian revival of Scottish nationalism, the city fathers decided that the coat of arms was inappropriate, and in the",

    " The Dayton Family The Dayton family is an American family of Swiss origin. The family's American roots date back to Robert Dayton (1660–1714), who was a New Netherland-born officer in the Dutch West India Company and a resident of New York City. The family is best known for its connection to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and its prominent role in the history of the city. The family's involvement in the history of Dayton began in the early 19th century with the construction of a trading post on the Great Miami River by Edward Dayton. The trading post was located near the site of present-day downtown Dayton. In 1819, the trading post was converted into a town, which was named Dayton after its founder. The Dayton family played a major role in the development of Dayton as a city. They were involved in the city's early politics, and several members of the family served as mayors of Dayton. The family also contributed to the city's cultural life, and the Dayton Art Institute and the Benjamin and Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center were built with money donated by the family. The Dayton family's influence in Dayton extended beyond the city limits. The family owned large areas of farmland surrounding Dayton, and they were instrumental in the creation of the Miami-Erie Canal, which connected Dayton to the rest of the country. The canal was a major factor in the city's growth and development. The Dayton family has been very influential in the history of the United States. Two members of the family served in the United States Congress, and one member served as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland. The family also played a role in the American Revolution, and several members of the family were active in the anti-slavery movement. The Dayton family continues to be active in Dayton's civic life. The family has been very generous with its donations to the city, and many of Dayton's finest buildings were built with money donated by the family. The family also sponsors a number of charitable foundations, and many members of the family are active in local politics.",
    " The Breit equation, named after the physicist Gregory Breit, is a type of integrable partial differential equation that occurs in a variety of applications in physics and mathematics. It is an example of aplanatic equation. The Breit equation is given by Breit equation where the function ω(x) is the Wronskian of two functions f and g that are smooth in the domain Ω, and the function κ(x) is a regular function in Ω. The Wronskian is defined by Wronskian A solution of the Breit equation is given by solution where ω and κ are constants that can be determined from the initial conditions. The general solution can be found by using the method of separation of variables. The Breit equation is a special case of a more general class of integrable partial differential equations called the integrable Schrödinger equations. These equations are integrable analogues of the non-integrable Schrödinger equation, and are related to the Dirac equation by the Kramers–Henkin–Rubin theorem. The Breit equation is also related to the heat equation by the method of characteristics. The Breit equation is important in the theory of partial differential equations, and has many applications in physics, including in the study of quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and general relativity. In particular, the Breit equation is the basis for the mathematical formulation of quantum electrodynamics, and is used to describe the behavior of charged particles in a vacuum. It is also used in the study of the structure of the hydrogen atom, and in the theory of the early universe. In addition, the Breit equation is used in the study of the properties of electromagnetic waves, and in the analysis of the behavior of materials with a high thermal conductivity.",

    " D-3 (video) \"D-3\" is the name for a series of analog and digital video recording formats developed by Sony. The analog format was introduced in 1982, and the digital format was introduced in 1995. Both formats are now obsolete. The analog D-3 format was a three-quarter-inch (19 mm) videocassette format that was capable of recording one hour of color video. It was similar to Sony's Betamax format, but the recording was done with a higher bandwidth, giving a higher horizontal resolution. It also used a different recording mechanism. Unlike Betamax, which used a single video head, the D-3 format used three video heads, one for each color. This gave a better color response, but required more precision during the recording and playback process. The format was not popular, and it was discontinued in 1986. The digital D-3 format was a professional digital video format that was capable of recording two hours of uncompressed digital video data. It used a large, heavy tape cartridge that was similar in size and shape to the analog D-3 format. The digital D-3 format was popular for a while, but it was eventually replaced by other formats, such as the Sony XDCAM format.",

    " Holocytochrome-c synthase is an integral membrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cell. It is involved in the synthesis and assembly of the heme cofactor into the cytochrome c molecule. The synthase is a dimer of two identical subunits, each consisting of three transmembrane spanning domains and a large luminal domain. The luminal domain contains two conserved regions, C1 and C2, that are involved in the recognition and binding of the heme precursor, porphyrin. The enzyme catalyzes two reactions: the first is the ATP-dependent condensation of two porphyrin molecules to form a dimethoxybenzoquinol, and the second is the transfer of the dimethoxybenzoquinol to the cytochrome c molecule. The dimethoxybenzoquinol is attached to the cytochrome c by a thioether bond to a conserved cysteine residue in the protein. The assembled holocytochrome c is then transported to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is involved in the electron transport chain. The holocytochrome c synthase is expressed in all tissues and is found in all eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and fungi. In humans, the gene encoding the synthase is located on chromosome 19, and mutations in the gene can lead to the development of anemia. The synthase is also a drug target for the treatment of malaria, as it is involved in the production of the heme cofactor for the malaria parasite.

    " Kostenurka Island (Russian: Остров Костенурка; Japanese: コスツェヌールカ島, Kosutzenouluka Shima) is an island in the Sea of Japan, off the east coast of Russia. Its name is derived from the Russian word \"kosyenok\" (\"miner\"). Administratively, it is part of the Khabarovsk Krai. In Russian, the island is sometimes called Ratmanov Island, after a Russian explorer, Nikolai Ivanovich Ratmanov, who visited it in the early 20th century. The island is long, about 30 km (19 mi), and narrow, about 1–3 km (0.62–1.86 mi). It is covered by taiga forest. The highest point is Mount Kokos, located in the center of the island, with a height of 724 metres (2,400 ft). Kostenurka Island is located about 130 km (81 mi) northeast of Khabarovsk. It is separated from the Russian mainland by the Khabarovsk Gulf in the west, and from the Kamchatka Peninsula by the Karaginsky Gulf in the east. The island is home to brown bears, sika deer, and sea otters. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the island was the site of a silver mine, and a town of the same name, established by a British company in 1880. The mine was active from 1898 to 1917, and was re-activated in the 1960s, when it was controlled by the Soviet Union. During the Russian Civil War, the island was occupied by the Whites, and then by the Soviets. In the 21st century, the island is a popular tourist destination for residents of Khabarovsk.",
    " The Kalamazoo-class monitor was a group of eight monitors built for the United States Navy during World War II. The monitors were named after cities and towns in Michigan and were designed to provide naval gunfire support to forces ashore. The monitors were very large for their day, being much larger than the vast majority of other ships of the period. They were also the first U.S. Navy capital ships to be designed and built from the ground up since the Mississippi-class battleship 35 years before. The Kalamazoo-class monitors were laid down beginning in 1944, but not completed until after the end of the war. The monitors were equipped with a variety of weapons, including a single 16-inch gun in a turret forward of the superstructure, two to four 105 mm guns in an amidships turret, two to four 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, and various other anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons. The Kalamazoo-class monitors were placed into service with the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1957, though most were placed into reserve or decommissioned before then. One of the monitors, the USS Kalamazoo, was sold to the Turkish Navy in 1954 and served with them until the 1980s.

    " 1309 Hyperborea 1309 Hyperborea is a large centaur (or possibly a smallish irregular satellite) in the outer Solar System, orbiting the Sun between Jupiter and Uranus. It was first discovered in 1925 by the Scottish astronomer James Hilton Brown, who found it by accident while observing Comet 1343 (Merson–PonsART). The name comes from the mythical land of Hyperborea. 1309 Hyperborea has a highly eccentric orbit, ranging from 5.4 to 19.5 times the orbit of Jupiter. The orbit is also inclined at an angle of 171 degrees to the plane of the planets, making it a retrograde orbit. The orbit is so retrograde that it is almost a mirror image of the orbit of Jupiter. The perihelion is located inside the orbit of Neptune. It has a semi-major axis of 21.4 AU, a perihelion of 4.34 AU, and an aphelion of 30.01 AU. The orbital period is about 243 years. 1309 Hyperborea was the first minor planet known to have a retrograde orbit. The retrograde motion was discovered in 1989 by the Canadian astronomer R. A. Kyle. The Minor Planet Center lists over 2,000 known minor planets, but the actual number is much higher, as many minor planets are lost in the solar glare and many have orbits too uncertain to be tracked. In addition, the Minor Planet Center only lists minor planets that have been observed at opposition within the last century. 1309 Hyperborea is approximately 100 miles (160 km) in diameter. It has a mass of 3.44 x 10^21 kg, making it one of the two most massive centaurs (the other being 5145 Pholus). The density is 1.33 g/cm³, which is close to the density of water. 1309 Hyperborea was first discovered in 1925 by the Scottish astronomer James Hilton Brown, who found it by accident while observing Comet 1343 (Merson–PonsART). The comet was discovered by the French astronomer Ernest Joseph Merson in 1898, and was lost shortly after its discovery. The comet was recovered in 1925 by the French astronomer Raymond Pons, who was using the same telescope that Merson used to discover the comet. Brown observed the comet in late April and early May, and noticed that it had a small companion. The companion was later identified as 1309 Hyperborea. 1309 Hyperborea was the first minor planet known to have a retrograde orbit. The retrograde motion was discovered in 1989 by the Canadian astronomer R. A. Kyle.",

    " Proto-Afroasiatic language The Proto-Afroasiatic language, or Proto-Khoisan, is the reconstructed language that is the ancestor of the Afroasiatic languages. It has been reconstructed using the comparative method from proto-Afroasiatic vocabulary, and, to a lesser extent, from proposed cognates in other language families, especially the Semitic, Cushitic, and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is generally held to have had a Semitic-style (or Abrahamic) triliteral phoneme system, with a three-way distinction between oral, nasal, and velar consonants. This system is well-documented in the Semitic and Cushitic branches, and is also assumed to have existed in Chadic and the putative Khoisan and East African branches. The most widely used reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic is that of Ehret, with six vowels, three pairs of diphthongs, and twenty-eight consonants. The table below gives the symbols used by Ehret and their phonetic values in the IPA. TheProto-Afroasiatic language had a number of other notable features, including an extensive set of ejective consonants, a three-way distinction between central and lateral consonants, and a register- contrasts in the vowels. The language had a number of implosive consonants, which are preserved in the Cushitic and Chadic branches, and a number of \"click\" consonants, which are preserved in the Khoisan and East African branches. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a basic word order of subject–verb–object, although a number of alternatives have been proposed. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a rich set of grammatical case markings, with at least eight grammatical cases, possibly including ablative, genitive, locative, ablative/genitive, and locative/genitive. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a set of distinctive pronouns for the first and second persons, as well as a set of gender-specific pronouns for the third person. The Proto-Afroasiatic language may have also had a set of inclusive and exclusive pronouns for the first person, as well as a set of \"clitic\" pronouns for the second and third persons. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a rich set of grammatical agreements, with distinctive marking for number, gender, and case on nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical markings forwords denoting actions, states, and locations. These markings are preserved in the Cushitic and Chadic branches, and are also found in some Semitic languages. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a rich set of grammatical moods and tenses, with distinctive markings for indicative, subjunctive, and imperative moods, as well as for past, present, and future tenses. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical particles, which are used to mark the beginning and end of sentences, as well as to indicate new information and emphasis. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical conjunctions and adverbs, which are used to mark the relationship between words and sentences, as well as to indicate time and place. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical interjections, which are used to mark greetings and other social interactions. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical suffixes and otherword-forming devices, which are used to form new words from existing words. The Proto-Afroasiatic language is thought to have had a number of special grammatical prefixes and otherword-forming devices, which are used to form new words from existing words.

    " Borsele (Borssela in West Flemish) is a village and a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the villages of Borsele, Cadzand, Eede, Ellewoutsdijk, and Grootebroek. Borsele is located in the extreme southwest of Belgium, on the border with the Netherlands. It is also located in the inlet of the Westerschelde. The municipality of Borsele is known for its long, sandy beaches and the large psychiatric hospital of Westerschelde. In 2021, the municipality had a population of 9,569. The name Borsele is thought to be derived from the Old English word \"bore,\" meaning \"deep hole,\" and the suffix \"-sela,\" meaning \"sandy soil.\" The name \"Borssela\" first appears in a charter from 1111. The village and the municipality were part of the territory of the counts of Flanders for much of their history.

Western climbers knew almost nothing about the mountain until 1990, when the Russian magazine \"Abaltur\" published an article about a team of Russian climbers who had climbed it in 1989. Since then, the Khan Tengri has become a popular climbing destination. In August 2008, a British team became the first to climb the Khan Tengri from the south side. They did it in a single push without returning to their base camp, following what they believe to be the first ascent by the Soviet team in 1989.

The game's music is much different from traditional adventure game music, taking a Latin-inspired approach. McConnell chose this style of music both because he thought it would complement the game's Spanish setting, and because he wanted to do something \"radically different\" from the \" sadness and despair\" that characterizes much of the music in adventure games. The game's main theme, \"Grim Fandango\", is a salsa tune that is used in various arrangements throughout the game. The theme was originally composed as a Latin waltz, but was later rearranged as a salsa by McConnell, who also added a \"descarga\" or \"improvised jam\" section to the end. The \"descarga\" was added to give the theme a \"Latin jazz feel\", and to give the musicians a chance to \"stretch out and get a little more soloistic\". The game's score also includes a \"romantic theme\" that is used for scenes involving the character Manny Calavera and his love interest, Mercedes. The game's \"credits theme\", which is played over the end credits, is a 2/3 metal version of the main theme, with a \"driving, aggressive\" arrangement by Latin Hawke. The music for Grim Fandango was composed using a combination of live musicians and Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) technology. The live musicians were mostly based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and were contracted through the game's audio production company, Giant Sound. The music was composed over the course of about a year, and was completed in the summer of 1998. The game's sound effects were created by Giant Sound, and were recorded at the company's studio in Los Angeles.",

    " A mere is a type of sword or knife popular during the Middle Ages. The word \"mere\" is derived from the Old English word myrige, meaning \"beautiful,\" \"fine,\" or \"delicate.\" Meres were often long swords, though they could also be shorter knives. They were normally single-edged and had a blunt, hooked tip known as a \"basket hilt.\" The name comes from the basket-like shape of the hilt, which was used to protect the blade's edge and tip. Meres were often used by medieval knights and were popular during the 14th and 15th centuries. There are several different types of meres, including the longsword, the backsword, and the saber. The longsword was a popular choice for medieval knights, as it was a powerful weapon for both offense and defense. The backsword was similar to the longsword, but it was usually shorter and had a blunt, hooked tip. The saber was a lighter, more curved version of the longsword, and was often used for fighting on horseback. Meres were typically made of steel or iron, and were often decorated with jewels or engravings. They were often used for fighting, but they could also be used for ceremony or decoration.",

    " Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumonia. It is the first antibody to be developed by the Swedish company Sobi. The drug is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. In February 2013, raxibacumab was designated a breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration. Severe pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue, with symptoms including high fever, shaking chills, coughing, and difficulty breathing. It is typically treated with antibiotics, such as penicillin, but this may not be effective in all cases because some bacteria have become resistant to these antibiotics. In these cases, a different course of treatment may be used, such as raxibacumab. Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody, a protein that binds to a specific target. In this case, the target is the alpha-haemolysin toxin produced by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumonia. The antibody binds to this toxin, preventing it from binding to its receptor and causing damage to the host's cells. This results in less damage to the lungs and a reduction in symptoms. The drug is given as an intravenous infusion, typically over the course of 30 minutes. The recommended dose is 2.5 grams, which is given once every three months. Raxibacumab has been studied in two phase 3 clinical trials. The first, called RAPID, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,078 patients with severe pneumonia. The second, called ARTEMIS, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 908 patients with severe pneumonia. In both trials, patients were randomized to receive either raxibacumab or a placebo. The primary endpoint in both trials was the reduction in the risk of death at 60 days after treatment. In the RAPID trial, there was a trend towards a reduction in the risk of death at 60 days, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death at 90 days, with a hazard ratio of 0.85. In the ARTEMIS trial, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death at 60 days, with a hazard ratio of 0.85. The most common adverse events in both trials were nausea, headache, and fever. There were no cases of severe allergic reactions, called anaphylaxis, in either trial. Raxibacumab is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. The drug has been designated a breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration, which means that it is considered to be a potential candidate for approval based on early clinical data. The company is currently working on completing the clinical development program for the drug. In February 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration designated raxibacumab as a breakthrough therapy. This means that the drug is considered to be a potential candidate for approval based on early clinical data. The drug is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. In August 2013, the company announced that the drug had been granted fast track status by the FDA. This means that the drug is considered to be a potential candidate for approval based on early clinical data. The drug is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. In April 2014, the company announced that the drug had been granted priority review status by the FDA.

    " Auguste Rodin, byname of Auguste Roideau, was a French sculptor, best known for his work The Thinker, The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. Born in 1840, Rodin studied at the Petite École, then at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he was a student of Louis David. He and his companion, Rose Beuret, had a son in 1864, but he died after only a few days. In the late 1860s, Rodin took a studio in Paris and began working on The Gates of Hell, a major sculpture that was to occupy him for the next 30 years. The Thinker, originally titled The Poet, was begun in 1880 and presented to the Salon in Paris the following year, where it was given the title The Thinker. It was later purchased by the French government for 5,000 francs and placed in the Musée du Luxembourg. The Kiss was originally titled The Embrace and was intended to be part of a larger work, The Gates of Hell. It was later sold as a separate work and purchased by the British government in 1907. It is now in the Tate Gallery in London. The Gates of Hell, which was never completed, is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. Rodin's works were often critical of the conventional morality of the time. The Gates of Hell, for example, features various figures in hell, including a pair of lovers who have been damned for their adultery. Rodin died in 1917. His works are among the most popular exhibits in the world, and many of them have been reproduced as statues, paintings, and prints.",

    " Charles Sumner House The Charles Sumner House is a historic house at 120 Mt. Auburn Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the former home of American statesman and senator Charles Sumner (1811–74), one of the leading Republicans of the 19th century. The house, designed by the architect Alexander Parris, was built in 1835 and is one of the few surviving examples of Greek Revival architecture in Cambridge. The house was occupied by Sumner from 1845 until his death in 1874. During that time, he became a prominent member of the Massachusetts state legislature and a United States senator. He was an avid abolitionist, and his house was a station on the Underground Railroad. The house was a focal point for the Cambridge abolitionist movement. On July 17, 1856, the house was bombed by a pro-slavery sympathizer, who threw a bomb through a window of the house while Sumner was sleeping. The bomb failed to explode, and the would-be bomber was later identified, tried, and sentenced to three years in prison. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. It is now a museum, owned and operated by the Historic New England organization. The Charles Sumner House is located in Cambridge's Harvard Square, near Harvard University, and is a prominent local landmark. The house is a two-story wood-frame structure, three bays wide, with a side-gable roof and a large central chimney.

In the liner notes to the album, Jones described the title track, \"The Ultimate,\" as a \"a state of mind, a place you can go, where you can be anything you want to be, do anything you want to do.\" The song is a long, improvisational piece, with the musicians taking turns in the spotlight. The other tracks on the album are more concise, with the majority of them being under five minutes in length. The Ultimate was not a commercial success, but it was well-received by critics, who praised its adventurous spirit and the strong performances by the musicians. It would go on to be regarded as one of the best albums of Jones' career, and has been re-released on CD a number of times.",
    " Papal inauguration of Pope Francis The papal inauguration of Francis took place on 13 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square. While previous papal inaugurations had been held in St. Peter's Square, the inauguration of Francis was the first to be held in the adjacent elliptical space, in front of the newly built Meta Sudio. The ceremony was attended by more than 150,000 people, who filled the square and the nearby streets. The number of attendees was surprising, given that the event was not well publicised. The Vatican had not arranged for the event to be shown live on television, and the local police had not expected such a large crowd. The ceremony began at 13:00 local time. In a break from tradition, Francis was not crowned with the tiara. After being presented with the pallium and the Ring of the Fisherman, he moved through the crowd to pray before the statue of Saint Peter, above which he had been elected. The ceremony ended with the singing of the \"Regina Caeli\". On the morning of 13 March 2013, Francis had breakfast with the cardinals who had elected him. He then received the congratulations of the diplomatic corps and was introduced to the office staff of the Holy See. In the afternoon, he met with the Curia, the dicasteries of the Roman Curia and the managers of the Vatican City State. In addition to the cardinals who had participated in the conclave, the inauguration was attended by more than 120 foreign delegations, including government officials from Argentina, Iraq, Japan, the United States and Venezuela, as well as from the European Union and the United Nations. The Israeli and Palestinian delegations were seated beside each other. The event was the first since the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870 that a pope had been installed in the Vatican City. Since the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Vatican City State has been the subject of a special, unique international status: it is not a member of the United Nations, and it is only partially recognized by some countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, Argentina and the United Kingdom.",

    " Cineraria (CinerariaSilverPenny) Cineraria ( /=ˌsiːnəˈrɑːriə/ siner-AH-ree-ə) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to southern and western Europe and the western Mediterranean region. The genus includes the species Cineraria filiformis, Cineraria lanata, Cineraria purpurata, Cineraria rosea, Cineraria saccharata, Cineraria silvestris, Cineraria squalida, and Cineraria thomasiifolia. Cineraria filiformis is the type species. The name Cineraria is derived from the Latin cinis, meaning \"ashes\", alluding to the greyish colour of the foliage. These are annual or biennial plants, 15–60 cm (6–24 in) tall, with Alternate leaves, basal and cauline, imparipinnate, with margins either undulate or crisped. The leaves are up to 15 cm (6 in) long, with the basal leaves being larger than the cauline leaves. The flowers are in a corymbiform inflorescence, with ray florets in shades of white, pink, or lavender. The receptacle is flat, with several rows of phyllaries. The anthers are cream-coloured. The style is about 5 mm (0.20 in) long, and the stigma is capitate. The fruits are achenes with pappi. The species are found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and waste places. Cineraria is related to the genus Senecio. In the past, the species of Cineraria were commonly placed in the genus Senecio. The relationship between Cineraria and Senecio was reviewed by B. Nordenstam in 2002, who found that Cineraria was paraphyletic with respect to Senecio, and that the species of Cineraria were distributed in three separate sections of Senecio. One of these, Senecio sect. Cineraria, consisted of the species previously known as Cineraria. The other two were new sections, sect. Senecio variegata and sect. Oligoneuron. The species of Cineraria are not closely related to the species of Senecio that they were formerly confused with, and are not members of either of the two sections of Senecio that they were placed in. They are more closely related to the members of the tribe Senecionae that were formerly placed in the genus Pericallis. Cineraria species are used as food plants by the larvae of various species of Lepidoptera. Cineraria is a traditional remedy used in the Mediterranean region. It has been used in the past as a purgative, and as a treatment for liver and spleen disorders. It is also used as a substitute for coffee.",

    " Shruti (music) In Indian classical music, shruti (श्रुति, literally \"that which is heard\"), is the smallest interval of pitch that can be identified by the human ear. The concept is closely related to the notion of pitch. A shruti is notated by the first three letters of the Indian alphabet, \"ँ श र्ता\" (na shra ta). The equivalent term in western music is \"quarter tone\", a half step or half-tone apart. However, shrutis are not precisely equivalent to quarter tones because they are melismatic. A shruti is defined as the pitch of a single note in the raga, and is the basic unit of measurement for distances between notes in the melody. However, the actual distance between two shrutis may be more or less than the distance between two Western quarter tones. For example, the pitch of the highest note of a piano (C5) to the pitch of the lowest note of a piano (C2) is an interval of 12 shrutis (the span of an octave), while the distance from the highest to the lowest note on a piano is 15 quarter tones. The 22 shrutis form a basic vocabulary of pitches from which the melodies of ragas are constructed. Indian classical music divides the shrutis into two groups: shadav-shrutis (literally, \"sixteen shrutis\"), and tivra-shrutis (literally, \"six shrutis\"). The shadav-shrutis form a system of 16 pitch classes, and the tivra-shrutis form a system of 6 pitch classes. The tivra-shrutis are sometimes called \"chromatic\" shrutis because they are what allow the musician to produce chromaticism, which is more common in Indian classical music than in Western classical music. In practice, the precise pitches of the shrutis are determined by the tune of the raga, and are not fixed. Furthermore, the distance between shrutis is not even. If an Indian classical musician is asked to produce the note \"C\", the musician will produce the note which is closest to \"C\" in the musician's own system of shrutis. Microtones are also found in other traditions of music in India, such as Indian folk music, as well as in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and other countries with a strong influence from Indian classical music. However, the use of microtones in these traditions is generally not as developed as in Indian classical music.",

    " Dissolution of Czechoslovakia On November 17, 1989, weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution began in Czechoslovakia. Students and young people protested in Prague's Wenceslas Square, singing songs and calling for freedom. The protests were peaceful, and the police did not intervene. The following day, November 18, about 300,000 people gathered in the square. Civic Forum, a new opposition group led by writer-journalist Václav Havel, had called for a general strike after negotiations with the Communist government failed. The strike also received support from the trade union umbrella organization, the Czech Trade Union Association (ČMKOS). The Communist government's inability or unwillingness to put an end to the unrest led to the resignation of the entire party leadership, including the country's leader, Gustáv Husák. A new government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Marián Čalfa. The main task of the new government was to start the process of transforming the economy and preparing the country for free elections. The new government also introduced a number of immediate reforms, including the abolition of the system of universities and the return of private ownership of property. The free elections were held on June 8, 1990. Civic Forum, which won the most votes, and Public Against Violence, which came second, entered into a coalition government with the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-ČSL), which won the third largest number of votes. The new government, headed by Prime Minister Václav Klaus, was sworn in on July 7, 1990. The first free presidential election was held on December 20, 1990. Václav Havel was elected president, and he was sworn in on December 29, 1990. On July 17, 1992, a group of concerned citizens, who felt that the country was being divided into two hostile camps, decided to launch a petition for the re-establishment of a democratic parliament, as they felt that the current parliament had been deformed by the communistic regime. The petition was launched on August 2, 1992, and by the end of the month it had received more than 50,000 signatures. A number of public protests were held in Prague and other cities in the autumn of 1992. The largest of these took place on October 27, when an estimated 500,000 people took part in a demonstration in Prague. The demonstration was organized by the Committee for the Defense of the Democratic Constitution, which was led by a number of well-known public figures, including Jaroslav Šedivý, Pavel Kohout, and Václav Malý. The petition for the re-establishment of a democratic parliament was handed to President Havel on October 28, 1992. The president then asked the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Lubomír Zaorálek, to set up a committee to examine the petition. The committee, which was made up of members of the Chamber of Deputies, met for the first time on November 4, 1992. After lengthy negotiations, a new government was formed on December 16, 1992, under the leadership of Prime Minister Jan Stránský. The new government was sworn in on December 22, 1992. On December 24, 1992, the Chamber of Deputies voted to dissolve the country's borders with Germany and Austria. The vote was preceded by a number of public protests, including a large demonstration in Prague on December 18, 1992, which was attended by an estimated 350,000 people. On December 25, 1992, the Czech Republic and Slovakia officially separated. The president of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel, and the president of Slovakia, Michal Kováč, met in Prague on December 29, 1992, and signed an agreement on the peaceful division of the country. The agreement was approved by the Czech and Slovak parliaments in January 1993. As a result of the division, two new states were created: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic, with its capital in Prague, was a parliamentary republic, while Slovakia, with its capital in Bratislava, was a constitutional republic. The two countries shared a common history, language, and culture, and had a similar economy. On January 1, 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent states.

    " A Soviet air show was an event where military aircraft of the Soviet Union would perform for the general public. These were quite different from the airshows of the West, being much more spectacular and intended to wow the audience with the might of Soviet military power. Although the first Soviet air show took place in 1912, they became much more frequent during the 1930s, when the Soviet Union began its first serious attempts at creating a domestic aircraft industry. These shows were used to demonstrate the latest Soviet aircraft, which were often experimental and not yet in service. During the 1940s and 1950s, many foreign delegations were invited to Soviet air shows to witness the latest Soviet aircraft. The most famous Soviet air show was the annual Victory Day flypast on 9 May, which was held on Moscow's Red Square. This grandiose event was intended to demonstrate the might of Soviet aviation and was often attended by senior Party and military leaders, as well as foreign delegations. The flypast traditionally began with a parade of fighters, followed by a formation of Soviet strategic bombers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union also held an annual \"Air Force Day\" on 23 August, which featured a flypast over Moscow's Tushino Airport. In the 1980s, Soviet air shows began to feature more exotic aircraft, such as the MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27, which were intended to demonstrate the latest Soviet military technology. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, many of these aircraft were sold to other countries, who continued to perform in air shows. Today, Russian aircraft continue to perform in international air shows, such as the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough Airshow.",
    " The Mercedes-Maybach 6 is a luxury concept car unveiled by German automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz at the 2015 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. A front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door convertible, the car was designed primarily as a style showcase, with its proportions and lines intended to evoke Mercedes-Benz's classic cars of the 1950s and early-1960s. A number of elements were drawn from the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL roadster, including its basic proportions and shape, as well as its large, curved headlamps, a three-pointed star in the grille, and the shape of the rear reflectors. The car also shares some design elements with the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 concept car that was unveiled at the 2014 Paris Motor Show. The Mercedes-Maybach 6 is powered by aretro-futuristic, 6.0-litre, twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 585 bhp (436 kW) and 1,000 Newton metres (738 lbf⋅ft) of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission and a limited-slip differential, allowing the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0.0 to 62.1 mph) in 4.6 seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). The car's performance figures were stated by Mercedes-Benz to be \"not intended for replication\", and were said to be limited by the car's aerodynamic characteristics. The Mercedes-Maybach 6's exterior design was the work of Mercedes-Benz's advanced design studio, Mercedes-Benz Style, while its interior design was the work of Mercedes-Benz's design studio, Mercedes-Benz Design.

    " Ming Shilu Ming Shilu (Chinese: 明时录; lit. 'The Account of the Ming Dynasty'), also known as the Zhenyuan Shilu ( Chinese: 真源实录; lit. 'The True Account of the Zhenyuan Era'), is an internal history of the Ming dynasty written by the historian Li Delun ( Chinese: 李德伦; 1541–1593), who spent his entire life in the Ming court. It covers the period from the founding of the Ming dynasty to the 44th year of the reign of the Ming emperor Wanli (1572). The Ming Shilu is one of the most important sources of the history of the Ming dynasty. After the Fall of the Ming, the Ming Shilu was continued by the Ming court as the diary of the corresponding era. The full title of the diary is Ming chunqiu ( Chinese: 明君曰; lit.

    " Yamatogoto Yamatogoto (大和GOTO, \"Japanese style GOTO\") is a style of GOTO that was developed in Japan in the early 20th century, based on the Western GOTO programming language. It was the first Japanese language GOTO to be developed, and is thus also called the \"original GOTO\". It was developed in the early 1900s by Japanese mathematician and computer scientist Kazuhito Kohjiro Kondo (近藤 和仁, 1908–1998). The method was initially called the Kondo method, but was later renamed Yamatogoto. The first reference to this method in the literature was in a journal called \"Mathematics and Computation\" in 1970. The name \"Yamatogoto\" comes from the word \"Yamato\", which means \"Japan\" in Japanese, and \"goto\", which means \"relay\" in Japanese. The name thus means \"Japanese style relay\". The Yamatogoto style of GOTO is characterized by the use of the while loop instead of the unconditional branch found in more traditional GOTO implementations. The use of the while loop is similar to the use of the for loop in more modern imperative programming languages. The designers of Yamatogoto also incorporated the concept of \"dynamic labels\" into the language. A dynamic label is a label that is associated with a location in the program text instead of with a fixed position in the program. In addition to these changes, Yamatogoto also introduced the \"data flow diagram\", which is used to represent the flow of data through the program. The data flow diagram is similar to the flowchart, which is used to represent the flow of control through the program. The Yamatogoto style of GOTO has been influential in the development of other Japanese language GOTO dialects, such as JAL and JxAL. It has also influenced the development of the Pascal programming language.",
    " Chorobates Rock is a balanced rock on the Island of Cyprus, located in the Limassol District. It is one of the most famous landmarks on the island and a popular tourist attraction. The rock is located on the edge of a cliff in the Amathus area, about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the Mediterranean Sea. It is a large, naturally formed, mushroom-shaped rock with a cap that rests on a pillar of rock. The cap is estimated to weigh about 250 tons. The rock can be reached by a path that leads to a staircase that ascends the side of the cliff to a point opposite the rock. A bridge connects the path to the rock. The word chorobates comes from the Greek words chora (area) and baths (walk), meaning \"the place where one can walk\". According to local legend, the rock was used as a natural bridge by an elderly woman who lived in the area. The woman had become too weak to walk to the church, so the rock formed a natural bridge to assist her journey. The rock has been a tourist attraction for centuries, and was depicted in medieval maps. It has been featured in literature, including in the works of the 16th-century Italian writer Giovanni Marrazzini, the 17th-century English writer Sir Walter Raleigh, and the 18th-century Irish writer Dean Jonathan Swift. In 2015, the rock was featured in the third episode of the American television series Ancient Aliens.",

The community was first settled in the early 1700s and was known as \"Tammany\" after Tamanend, a Delaware Indian chief. It was the site of one of the first shipyards in the Atlantic Canada region. In his book \"The History of Digby\", J.W. Duckworth wrote in 1895 \"The ship-building firm of John hall & Company, of London, engaged in the building of ships in the year 1792, in a yard at Tammany on the St. Mary's river, three miles below Digby. The first ship, the \"James and Mary\", was launched in 1793, and was followed by the \"HMS surveyed\", a 54-foot-keel, 20-ton gunboat, built for the British government for the protection of the fisheries. This was launched in 1796. The yard continued in operation for many years, and the \"HMS Archer\", a Rating four, 54-foot-keel gunboat, was launched there in 1811. During the War of 1812, the \"HMS Archer\" was on the Great Lakes, and was captured by the Americans at the Battle of Lake Erie. In 1825 the British government established the \"HMS Dauphine\" at Tammany, as a depot for the West Indies squadron. This was a Rating six, 64-foot-keel, 20-gun, brass-plated ship, built at Deptford, England, in 1824. It was commanded by Captain George Muttlebury. The ship left England in September 1824, arriving in Digby in October. The crew spent the winter of 1824–1825 there, suffering from \" shipbuildingitis\", a term used to describe what the author believed was the first case of what is now called \"seasonal affective disorder\". The \"Dauphine\" left Digby in May 1825 to join the squadron in the West Indies, and was later sold to the Portuguese government. A 20-gun, two-masted corvette, it was renamed the \"D. pmo. Xavier\" and served in the Brazilian navy until 1864.

    " Four Seasons (murals) The Four Seasons is a set of four murals by Italian artist Paolo Veronese, commissioned in 1576 by the doges of Venice, Andrea and Nicolò GRIMANI, to decorate the walls of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Doge's Palace, Venice. Each of the four paintings depicts a different season. The Four Seasons is a recurring theme in the history of Western art, representing one of the first examples of the use of the same subject matter in different artistic media, such as painting, sculpture, and music. The Veronese murals are particularly notable for their trompe-l'œil elements, such as the two spectators in the centre of the Winter scene, who appear to be in conversation with each other, but are in fact separated by a large gap in the wall. The four paintings were in the Hall of the Great Council for over 250 years, until they were moved to the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome in the 19th century. They were returned to the Doge's Palace in 2015.",

    " The Song of Songs (play) The Song of Songs is a romantic play by American writer Sheldon Harnason. It is based on the biblical story of the Song of Solomon, also known as the Song of Songs or Canticles. The play's title is taken from the first line of the Bible, \"The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.\" The play is set in the court of King Solomon. The king is old, and the action revolves around his search for a successor. The queen, Bathya, is a strong-willed, powerful woman, and the king's chief wife. She is concerned for the future of her son, Prince David, the heir apparent. The king's other wives, Naamah and Abishag, are lesser figures, although Abishag has a romantic relationship with the king. The king's main concern is the disposition of his wealth. He has accumulated vast amounts of gold, and he worries that his successor will not be able to keep it together. The king's wealth is the cause of much of the action in the play. The king's closest advisor, Benjamin, is the keeper of the king's wealth. The king's other advisor, Nathan, is the royal prophet. The king's two sons, David and Absalom, are in line to succeed him. David is the elder, and is married to the princess from Tyre, Taphath. Absalom is the younger, and is married to the princess from Egypt, Othniel. The king's other possible successor is his brother, Adonijah. Adonijah is not married, and is the king's favorite. The play is set in the months leading up to the king's death. The king is determined to choose his successor based on the wisdom of his counselors, and not based on the wealth or popularity of the potential successors. The king's main concern is to keep the wealth of the kingdom together. The play ends with the king's death, and the accession of David to the throne.",

    " The Yale romanization of Mandarin, also known as Yale romanization or pinyin, is a system of romanization of Mandarin Chinese developed by the Yale alphabetic system committee, which was headed by George A. Miller, during the early 1950s. The Yale system was an outgrowth of the Joint Commission on Chinese Romanization, which was composed of scholars from the United States and China and which met in New Haven, Connecticut, in the early 1950s. The Yale system was published in a report entitled Romanization of Chinese by the Yale-China Association in 1953. The Chinese government adopted a modified form of the Yale system as its official romanization in 1958, and it was given the name pinyin (literally, \"romanization\") in 1982. The Yale romanization system is based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing. It uses the Latin alphabet to represent Mandarin sounds, with some diacritics to indicate tones. The Yale system can be represented in plain text without diacritics, though this has the disadvantage of losing the information about tones. The Yale system has been influential in teaching Mandarin to foreigners. It was used in the teaching of Mandarin at Yale University for several decades and was also used by other universities in the United States and elsewhere. It is still widely used in books and in the media, especially in the United States and Taiwan, and it has been influential in the design of other romanization systems. However, the use of Yale romanization has been decreasing, and it has been replaced by pinyin in most educational contexts.",

    " Freedom Is a State of Mind \"Freedom Is a State of Mind\" is the title of a song by the American rock band Boston from their second studio album, Don't Look Back. It was released as the album's third single in 1986. The song reached number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 13 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song's main riff is very similar to that of the song \"Uncle Salty\" from the band's first album, Boston. The music video for the song was directed by David Van Hoogenaten and was released in 1986. It features a man in a dark room, with a single spotlight, singing the song. The man is played by lead singer Brad Delp's brother, Jim Delp. The song was re-recorded by the band for their 2006 studio album, Boston VI: Live to Win, with the title \"Freedom Is a State of Mind (Live to Win)\". \"Freedom Is a State of Mind\" was the last song performed by Boston live, at the Hollywood RockWalk on September 1, 2007. In the liner notes of the 2000 Boston box set, Delp said of the song: \"This was the last song we wrote for Don't Look Back. We needed one more song to round out the album, and this one just fell together in the studio. It's one of those songs that is what it is, and it's hard to analyze. I like the guitar work on it, and the chorus is very singable. It's one of those songs that, when we play it live, people just instinctively start singing along with it.\"",
    " The Confederacy (British political group) was a political group active in the United Kingdom from the late 1970s until the early 1990s. It was formed in 1978 by a merger of the National Front (NF) with the British National Party (BNP), and was led by John Tyndall. The group was active in the National Front until the early 1990s, and played a significant role in the foundation and development of the British National Party. The NF had been established in 1967 by a group of former members of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), and had won two seats in the House of Commons in the 1979 general election. However, it had become divided into two factions, one of which was led by Tyndall, who favoured a more working-class approach. In 1980, the two factions merged, with the group that supported Tyndall's ideas forming the core of the new Confederacy. The Confederacy was opposed to the 'multi-cultural society' and believed that the NF's approach was too extreme. It sought to develop a more pragmatic approach, and focused its activities on the working class, arguing that the NF's middle-class support was insufficient to win power. It also sought to develop a more professional approach, and adopted the title 'The British Nationalist Party' for its electoral candidates. In 1981, it won three seats in the House of Commons, and in 1982 it won a further two seats. However, the Confederacy was also beset by internal divisions, and in 1983 it split into two factions, one of which was led by Tyndall, and the other by Andrew Brons. The two factions reunited in 1985, but the group remained unstable, and in 1990 it finally split into two separate groups, the British National Party and the British Democratic Party.",

    " Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon The first African-American film star to win a Best Actor Oscar, Sidney Poitier (1927–2022) played a pivotal role in the emergence of Black icons in Hollywood films. He made his film debut in the 1950 film No Way Out, and his breakthrough came with his first leading role in the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle. His work as a civil rights activist and as a Bahamian citizen also played a role in the early 1960s movement for the independence of the Bahamian colony from the British Empire. In the early 1960s, Poitier's work as a film, stage, and television actor began to receive awards and critical acclaim, and he became the first African-American male to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his work in the 1964 film Lilies of the Field. His other major roles during this period included A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Pressure Point (1962), and In the Heat of the Night (1967). Poitier's emergence as a Black icon was influenced by several factors, including his personal life, his Bahamian citizenship, his civil rights activism, and his work in the arts. His work as an actor and as a citizen of the Bahamas helped to break down barriers for Black actors and to change the way Black people were portrayed in the media. His work as a civil rights activist helped to raise awareness about racial inequality and discrimination in the United States.",

    " Bidens hyperborea is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to northern North America. It is an herbaceous perennial plant that can reach 100 cm (39 in) in height. The stems are generally unbranched, and the leaves are 20–40 cm (7.9–15.7 in) long and 10–20 cm (3.9–7.9 in) wide, with petioles generally 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) in length. The flowers are produced in mid-summer, with the ray flowers being either yellow or white and the disc flowers being yellow. The fruit is a cypsela with paired pappi. The species is divided into two varieties, var. hyperborea and var. glandulosa. The latter is distinguished by its glandular disc flowers. Bidens hyperborea is widely distributed throughout Canada, the United States, and Greenland. It occurs in coastal areas, open moist meadows, and along streams. The species is found at high latitudes, but not at high elevations. It can survive in temperatures as low as −40 °C (−40.0 °F). Bidens hyperborea is a nectar source for bees and butterflies. The seeds are eaten by songbirds, and the caterpillars of Silvery Checkerspot (Sarangesa protea) feed on the leaves. Bidens hyperborea is a traditional medicinal plant used by the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The leaves are used as a poultice for wounds and as a tea for colds, while the roots are used for the same purposes, as well as for stomach and intestinal ailments. The seeds have been used as a coffee substitute. The species was first described by Linnaeus in 1753 as Bidens hyperborea. It was later lumped into Bidens pilosa, but has since been restored to its own species.",

    " Fantastic Wounds In his book The Fantastic Tradition in British and American Literature, D.C. Drotner defines the fantastic as \"an unusual, extraordinary, or bizarre event, circumstance, or effect within a narrative that is both credible and unbelievable, and that is used to heighten a reader's sense of dissonance and delight\". The fantastic can be found in many genres, including fantasy, horror, mystery, suspense, and science fiction. It is often associated with the concept of the Uncanny. The word \"fantastic\" derived from the Greek phantastikos (fanta-, \" imaginations\" + -astikos, \"able to make visible\") was first used in the 17th century to describe the imagination, and it took on its more modern sense of \"unusual and incredible\" in the 18th century. In contemporary usage, the term fantastic is sometimes used to describe something that is wonderful or impressive. Fantastic wounds are common in fantastic fiction. They are often used to heighten the sense of disbelief and delight, and to emphasize the Uncanny. A fantastic wound is an injury that would be impossible or highly unusual in the real world, such as a hole in the chest that does not bleed, a missing limb that can be reattached, or a wound that is not fatal. Fantastic wounds are often used to mark the boundary between the real world and the world of the fantastic. In some cases, fantastic wounds can be used to heal the victim, as in the case of a character who is wounded in a fantastic way and then healed by a fantastic means. In his essay \"On the Fantastic\", Jorge Luis Borges discusses the relationship between the real world and the fantastic. He notes that the fantastic is often associated with the Uncanny, and that both the fantastic and the Uncanny can be used to create a feeling of dissonance. Borges also discusses the relationship between the fantastic and the real, and how the fantastic can be used to reveal the real. For example, a story about a character who is wounded in a fantastic way can be used to show the reader the real world through the lens of the fantastic.",

    " Buffalo Grove Ambush The Buffalo Grove Ambush was a gunfight that took place at a rural farm near Buffalo Grove, Texas on June 18, 1871, during the final days of the American Civil War. The gunfight occurred when a group of seven Union Army soldiers who had been sent to the farm to retrieve a cache of weapons and ammunition were ambushed by a group of Confederate States Army soldiers who had been hiding in a cornfield. The Union soldiers were killed, and the cache of weapons and ammunition was captured by the Confederates. The Buffalo Grove Ambush was the last major battle of the Civil War to take place in Texas. The Buffalo Grove Ambush was a well-planned and coordinated attack. The Confederates, who were hiding in a cornfield, opened fire on the Union soldiers as they approached the farm. The Union soldiers, who were not expecting an attack, were caught off-guard and quickly overwhelmed by the Confederates. The gunfight lasted for a few minutes, with the Confederates ultimately prevailing. After the gunfight, the Confederates took the weapons and ammunition that they had been hiding in the cornfield and left the scene. The Union soldiers were killed, and their bodies were later found by a group of local residents. The residents, who were sympathetic to the Confederate cause, buried the Union soldiers in a shallow grave and reported the incident to the Confederate authorities. The Buffalo Grove Ambush was a major victory for the Confederates, as it provided them with a much-needed supply of weapons and ammunition. The ambushers were a group of Confederate deserters who had been hiding in the area since the end of the Civil War. They were led by a man named Richard Morgan, who was wanted by the Confederate authorities for desertion. The deserters were also wanted for a series of other crimes, including theft and murder.",
    " African Sources for African History The study of African history is beset by problems of sources. For many centuries, the written history of Africa was dominated by accounts from European traders, administrators, soldiers, and missionaries who were mostly interested in the coasts and in the affairs of states with whom they traded. Their records are full of prejudice, ignorance, and errors. From the later 19th century, however, African history began to be shaped by African scholars. The traditional history of the African continent is one of the oldest known. In the 21st century, oral traditions continue to be a vital source for African history. The historical records of the ancient Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans contain references to the African continent and to the cultures of its inhabitants. However, because these references are often late and unreliable, the traditional history of Africa is usually ignored by professional historians. The ancient Egyptians developed a writing system called hieroglyphs, and their records are some of the earliest known. From the 5th century BC, Egypt was conquered by a series of foreign powers, including the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans. For this reason, the ancient Egyptians are often a source for the history of other cultures. However, because the Egyptians had a strong sense of their own unique identity, their records are also an important source for African history. The ancient Egyptians are best known for their monumental architecture, such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Great Sphinx, and the Temple of Luxor. Their other achievements, in areas such as art, mathematics, and astronomy, are also significant. The ancient Persians were a powerful civilization that spanned much of the world, including parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Persian Empire was ruled by a series of monarchs, or shahs, who were advised by a royal council. The most powerful shah was Cyrus the Great, who founded the empire and made it a major power in the world. The Persians were known for their ability to conquer other nations, and they had a major influence on the culture of the countries they conquered, including Egypt. The ancient Greeks were a civilization that began in the Mediterranean region of the world and later spread to other parts of the world, including Africa. The first Greek settlements in Africa were in the eastern Mediterranean, on the island of Crete, and in what is now Libya. The Greeks were a major power in the world, and their influence spread throughout the Mediterranean region and beyond. The Greeks were known for their art, literature, philosophy, and science. The ancient Romans were a civilization that began in the Italian peninsula and later spread to other parts of the world, including Africa. The first Roman settlements in Africa were in what is now Libya. The Romans were a major power in the world, and their influence spread throughout the Mediterranean region and beyond. The Romans were known for their art, literature, engineering, and military might.",

    " The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election in which all 50 states participated. Indiana voters chose 11 electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. Indiana was won by Trump, who carried the state with 61.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 18.2%. Prior to the election, all 14 news organizations projected Indiana as strongly Republican. Trump significantly improved on his 2016 performance in Indiana, improving his vote share by 4.4% and his margin of victory by 4.1%. In 2016, Trump won the state with 56.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 16.3%. With Trump's victory in the state, he passed William Henry Harrison and became the third Republican to win the state twice, after Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Biden carried Indiana's 12 most populated counties, including Marion County, where the state's largest city and capital Indianapolis is located. Indiana was the state with the most electoral votes to be won by Trump, and was the fifth most populous state in the nation. In recent years, Indiana has trended Republican, with the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state being Barack Obama in 2008. In 2016, Indiana gave Trump 56.2% of the vote, with the state's electoral delegates giving him enough electoral votes to claim the presidency even if he had lost every other state. In the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Republican Party nominated incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as the Republican ticket to run for office. The Republican National Convention was held in the state's largest city, Indianapolis. The 2016 Democratic National Convention was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the Democratic Party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Tim Kaine as the Democratic ticket to run for office. Clinton won the national popular vote but lost the electoral college to Trump. The 2020 Democratic National Convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Democratic Party nominated former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris as the Democratic ticket to run for office. Biden won the national popular vote as well as the electoral college. The election was held during a period of great unrest in the country, with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic crisis having begun in March, the George Floyd protests beginning in May, and the 2020 United States census beginning in April. In the weeks prior to the election, Trump and Biden were nearly tied in the polls, with Trump holding a slight edge. On October 22, 2020, Trump and Biden debated in a tense first presidential debate, with Trump repeatedly interrupting Biden. The debate was held at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Trump won the election, with 61.2% of the vote and a margin of victory of 18.2%. Biden won the national popular vote, with 51.3% of the vote and a margin of victory of 4.5%. On election night, Trump held a large rally with his supporters in the East Room of the White House to await the results. At around 1:00 a.m. EST on November 4, 2020, Biden was declared the winner of the election, having won the state of Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. Trump did not concede the election, and he and his supporters continued to make unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud. On December 14, 2020, the United States House of Representatives voted to accept the electoral college votes of Michigan and Arizona, which were contested by Trump. The next day, the United States Senate voted to accept the electoral college votes of Michigan and Arizona. The votes of the two states gave Biden a total of 306 electoral votes, enough to win the presidency.",

    " Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 344 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a bank that issues a cashier's check to a customer, and then receives the check back from the customer without the customer's signature, is not required to make payment on the check. The Court held that the bank's receipt of the unsigned check was the same as receiving a blank piece of paper, and therefore the bank was not liable for the check. The Court's decision was unanimous. The case began in Florida state court, where Barnett Bank of Marion County (the bank) brought an action against Joseph H. Nelson (the customer) to collect on a cashier's check that Nelson had issued to himself. The face amount of the check was $29,737.81, and the bank claimed that Nelson had failed to pay on the check. At trial, the bank introduced the unsigned check, and the customer did not dispute that the signature on the check was his. However, Nelson claimed that he was not liable for the check because he had not signed it. The trial court found in favor of the bank, and Nelson appealed. The Florida District Court of Appeal reversed the decision, holding that a cashier's check is payable only upon the bank's presentation of the check for payment, and that the bank's mere retention of the check does not constitute \"payment\" of the check. The bank then appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the District Court's decision. The case then went to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case. The Court held that under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which has been adopted by the state of Florida, a bank's receipt of a cashier's check without the customer's signature is the same as receiving a blank piece of paper, and therefore the bank is not liable for the check. The Court also noted that the bank had issued the check to Nelson, and therefore it was not a \"third-party\" check under the UCC. The Court's decision was unanimous.",
    " Metro Railway, Kolkata The Metro Railway, Kolkata (formerly known as the Calcutta Metro) is a rapid transit system serving the city of Kolkata and the districts of South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the first underground railway system in India, and the first rapid transit system in South Asia. The Metro was opened in 1984, after construction began in 1972. The Metro is a major mode of transport in Kolkata, with an average daily ridership of around 1.4 million passengers in 2019. The Kolkata Metro is the sixth busiest rapid transit system in the world by passenger density, and the third busiest in India, after the Mumbai Metro and the Delhi Metro. The stations of the Kolkata Metro are farther apart than those of most other metros, and the trains are relatively slow. However, the system has the highest daily ridership per route-kilometre in the world, at 1.3 million. The metro has two branches, one from Dum Dum to Kestopur and the other from Dakshineswar to Kestopur. The two branches meet at Esplanade station, and together the two lines form a 21.5 km (13.4 mi) long metro line. The Metro has 27 stations and a total of 36.45 km (19.48 mi) of track. The Kolkata Metro is built to a larger gauge than most other rapid transit systems in the world, and is therefore sometimes described as a \"wide gauge\" metro. The larger gauge is intended to allow for larger trains and higher speeds. The Kolkata Metro has two types of services: 1. The Mainline has a frequency of 2–3 minutes during peak hours and 3–4 minutes off-peak. 2. The Circular Line has a frequency of 5 minutes during peak hours and 10 minutes off-peak. The Metro Rail is a joint venture of the Government of West Bengal (GoWB) and the Government of India (GoI), through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The West Bengal Metro Rail Corporation Limited (WBMRCL), a company fully owned by the GoWB, is responsible for the implementation of the project. The Kolkata Metro is the first metro in India to use rolling stock manufactured in India. The Kolkata Metro has two types of stations: 1. Underground stations: The stations at Dakshineswar, Chandni Chowk, and Esplanade are underground. 2. Elevated stations: The stations at Dum Dum, Kestopur, and Phoolbagan are elevated. The Kolkata Metro is one of the most energy-efficient rapid transit systems in the world, consuming only 0.48 kWh per traveller per kilometre, compared to a global average of 3.6 kWh per traveller per kilometre. The Kolkata Metro has been in operation since October 1984. The Metro was first proposed in 1965, with the project being approved in 1970. Construction began in 1972, with the first stretch of the Metro being opened in 1984. The Metro was built in two phases, with the first phase being from Dum Dum to Kestopur, and the second phase being from Dakshineswar to Kestopur. The two phases were opened in 1984 and 1995, respectively. The Kolkata Metro has been expanded twice since it was first built. The first expansion was from Dum Dum to Dakshineswar, which was opened in 2009. The second expansion was from Kestopur to Nayapalli, which was opened in 2014. The Nayapalli extension is a branch of the Dum Dum–Dakshineswar line, and is not connected to the rest of the Metro. The Kolkata Metro has been proposed to be expanded further, with a new line from Howrah to Sealdah via Esplanade and a new line from Salt Lake to Howrah via Dum Dum.",
    " Pleurotus citrinopileatus, commonly known as the lemon pleurotus, is a species of edible fungus in the family Pleurotaceae. It was first described by mycologist Meyer in 1928. The fungus is characterized by a strong lemon scent and is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America, where it grows on decaying hardwood trees, particularly ash, or on the roots of living trees in forests. The fruit bodies are characterized by a white to buff-colored cap, with a slight incurving margin and a tendency to become lobed with age. The flesh is white, with a mild to slightly sour taste. The spore print is white, and the distribution of the spores on the gill is intervenose. The lemon pleurotus is edible and can be eaten raw, although it is not as palatable as when cooked. As its name suggests, the fungus has a lemon scent that is stronger when the fruit bodies are dried. It can be used to add flavor to soups and salads, or when cooked alone, it can be served as a side dish. In the kitchen, the mushroom can be used in place of the more expensive oyster mushrooms. The lemon pleurotus grows on hardwood trees, especially ash, in forests. The fungus grows on dead or dying trees, and on the roots of living trees. The fruit bodies can be found between June and November in the northern hemisphere. They are characterized by a white to buff-colored cap, with a slight incurving margin and a tendency to become lobed with age. The flesh is white, with a mild to slightly sour taste. The spore print is white, and the distribution of the spores on the gill is intervenose. The lemon pleurotus is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America, where it grows on decaying hardwood trees, particularly ash, or on the roots of living trees in forests. The fungus has also been reported in Japan, where it grows on mulberry trees. The lemon pleurotus is edible and can be eaten raw, although it is not as palatable as when cooked. As its name suggests, the fungus has a lemon scent that is stronger when the fruit bodies are dried. It can be used to add flavor to soups and salads, or when cooked alone, it can be served as a side dish. In the kitchen, the mushroom can be used in place of the more expensive oyster mushrooms. The lemon pleurotus is closely related to the more common Pleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom. The two can be distinguished by their color, with the lemon pleurotus having a more intense lemon color, and by their smell, with the lemon pleurotus having a stronger lemon scent.",

    " New London Harbor Light The New London Harbor Light is an active lighthouse on the west side of the Thames River, New London, Connecticut. It is located on the former site of Fort Trumbull, which was an integral part of the harbor's defenses during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. In Nigerians, Fort Trumbull was the site of a battle in which the British captured the fort from the French in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The British remained in control of the fort until the end of the war in 1783, when they evacuated and destroyed much of the fort's infrastructure. The United States government reconstructed Fort Trumbull in the early 1800s, and it was equipped with twenty-six 24-pounders and two 13-inch mortars. During the War of 1812, the fort was the site of a battle between British forces, assisted by a contingent of loyalists, and American militia led by Connecticut Governor Roger Griswold. On September 6, 1814, the British attacked the fort and burned the surrounding village of Groton. They were repulsed with significant losses by the fort's garrison, which was assisted by the crew of the USS Flicker. The British retreated to their ships and shelled the fort for the next three days. The fort's 150-man garrison held out, despite suffering twenty-one casualties, until the British abandoned the field on September 9. The New London Harbor Light was one of the earliest lighthouses in the United States. It was lit in 1760, and is therefore known as the third oldest lighthouse in the country. The New London Harbor Light was also the first lighthouse in the country to be built on a fort. The New London Harbor Light is a Visitors' Center for the New London Maritime Museum. The Museum offers tours of the Light and Fort Trumbull. Connecticut's state seal features a shield with a blue background, on which a tall ship, a symbol of the state's maritime history, is depicted. The state motto, \"Qui Transtulit Sustinet,\" is displayed on a ribbon surrounding the shield, and translates to \"He Who Transplanted Still Sustains.\" The seal was adopted in 1775, shortly after the colony's inception.",
    " Paul Nietsche Paul Nietsche was a 19th-century philosopher who had a profound impact on modern thought. He was born in Germany in 1844 and spent most of his life there, but he did spend some time in Switzerland, where he died in 1900. Nietsche's writing was often critical of religion, and he was seen as a controversial figure during his lifetime. However, his ideas have had a lasting impact on philosophy and have been studied and debated for generations. One of Nietsche's most famous works was \"The Birth of Tragedy,\" which he wrote in 1872. In this book, Nietsche argued that the world is a constant struggle between two opposing forces: the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The Apollonian represents order and logic, while the Dionysian represents chaos and instinct. Nietsche believed that both forces were necessary for a healthy society, but that the Apollonian had become too dominant in Western culture. He argued that the Dionysian needed to be re-emphasized in order to balance out the Apollonian. Another important work by Nietsche was \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\" which he wrote in 1883. In this book, Nietsche presented a fictional character, Zarathustra, who was a prophet and a wise man. Zarathustra spoke about the need for people to overcome their fear of death and to live life to the fullest. Nietsche also discussed the idea of the \"eternal recurrence,\" which is the idea that events will always repeat themselves in the same way. In his final years, Nietsche's health began to decline, and he died in 1900 at the age of 56. Despite his relatively short life, Nietsche's ideas have had a lasting impact on philosophy and continue to be studied and debated to this day.",

    " The Daily Show: Indecision 2006 The Daily Show: Indecision 2006 was a special edition of Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart that ran from November 7 to November 9, 2006. The show, which was the third and final edition of the series to run over multiple nights, was a wrap-up to the 2006 midterm elections, which were held on November 7. The show was the first multi-night edition since the series' earliest days, when it was known as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and was primarily a satirical news-based talk show, rather than the hybrid news/comedy show it has since become. The show was broken up into multiple segments, including \"Indecision 2006,\" a live half-hour election night show on November 7; \"Midnight Indecision,\" a live hour-long show that immediately followed Indecision 2006 on November 7; \"Indecision: Now What?,\" a live show on November 8; and \"Indecision 2006: The Hangover,\" a live show on November 9. The November 9 show was the only one of the four that was not live. The Daily Show was the first network late-night show to broadcast live on election night, and this edition of the series received a few technical patents for the electronic voting map used to illustrate the election returns. On the November 7 Indecision 2006 show, the correspondents used the \"Magic Wall\" to explain the election returns. The wall was made up of a large number of small, square, red and blue lights, each of which represented a single voting district. The colors of the lights were initially all blue, signifying that no votes had yet been cast. As the night went on and the votes were counted, the lights changed to red or blue to represent which party had won each district. The magic wall was updated in real time, with the updated results displayed as they came in. The wall was designed by Alex Pollack. The November 7 show also featured a special video introduction by Jon Stewart, who, in character as the show's anchor, explained that the show was going to be different that night, because it was \"live.\" In addition to the special video and graphics, the show's theme music was also changed for the night. Instead of the usual fast-paced theme, the show used a slower, more suspenseful version of the theme, designed to heighten the suspense of the election returns. In the course of the evening, the show also used a number of guest commentators, including political analyst Nancy Walls, comedian and actress Kathy Griffin, and Daily Show correspondents Rob Riggle, Stephen Colbert, and Samantha Bee. At the end of the November 7 show, Jon Stewart anchored the \"Tales from the Trump Club\" segment, which featured a number of jokes at the expense of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who had already announced that he would be running for president in 2008. The November 7 show was watched by an average of 1.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode of The Daily Show since the show's inception in 1996. The show also received a 3.2 rating/5 share in the key 18-49 demographic, which was the highest rating in the show's history.",

    " Daedalus Reef Daedalus Reef is an exposed triangle-shaped reef in the Red Sea, about 80 km from the coast of the Sinai Peninsula. It is one of the most prominent reefs in the Red Sea and is also one of the most northern reefs in the Red Sea. The reef is shaped like a triangle with a shallow lagoon in the middle. The eastern side is the longest, about 1.5 km, and the northern side is the shortest, about 1 km. The south and the west have a long outer reef running parallel to the reef proper. The western outer reef is longer, about 2.5 km, and the southern outer reef is shorter, about 1.5 km. The lagoon is about 3 km in length and 1.5 km in width. The eastern part of the lagoon is shallow and the western part is deeper, with a maximum depth of about 60 m. There are two small islands in the lagoon, the smaller one in the west and the larger one (Daedalus Island) in the east. The larger island is the location of a navigation light. There are two small ergs on the northern and southern tips of the reef. The ergs are small, narrow, sandy islets that are extensions of the reef. The one on the northern tip is about 180 m long and the one on the southern tip is about 400 m long. The water depth around the reef is very deep, making it an ideal location for sport diving. The average depth of the water around the reef is 30-40 m, with some parts reaching 60 m and beyond. The wall drops down to the deep water in a very vertical fashion, making for some spectacular diving. The wall is covered with a variety of soft and hard corals. The main attraction of the reef is the possibility to see sharks and other large marine life. The southern tip of the reef is a well-known location for seeing schools of hammerhead sharks. The outer reefs are also good locations for seeing reefs sharks, especially the silvertip shark and the grey reef shark. The lagoon is home to a variety of smaller fish, as well as some larger species, such as the Napoleon wrasse and the groupers.",
    " Province of Schleswig-Holstein The Province of Schleswig-Holstein is a province in the north of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. It extends from the Eider River in the west to the Baltic Sea in the east. The city of Flensburg is the capital and the largest city. The area of the province is 18,386 square kilometers (7,100 sq mi), making it the tenth-largest German state in area ( bypassing Berlin and Hamburg ). In 2015, the population was 2,284,000. It is the third most populous German state after North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria. The area that later became the province was part of the Kingdom of Denmark until the early 19th century. After being conquered by the German Federation (the Confederation of the Rhine) in 1815, it was granted to the Danish King by the German Federal Act of 25 June 1815 (see also German Confederation). The area was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940 and was organized as the German province of Schleswig-Holstein from 1941 to 1945. After the war, it was divided into two zones, with the northern part becoming part of the Danish zone and the southern part becoming part of the American zone. The British zone between the American and Danish zones was eliminated in the Schleswig plebiscites in 1946, in which the people in the northern half of the former British zone voted to join Denmark and the people in the southern half voted to remain with Germany. The German-Danish border was then established along the Flensburg-Schleswig line, where it has remained since. The name Schleswig-Holstein reflects the merger of two medieval duchies: Schleswig and Holstein. The Danish duchy of Schleswig was a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and the German duchy of Holstein was a fief of the Danish duchy. The two were only united politically in the 19th century. Today, the province of Schleswig-Holstein is the site of the Eider Barrage, which dams the Eider River and cuts off the Eiderstedt Peninsula from the rest of the mainland. The peninsula is the site of the German-Danish border crossing at Eldorado.",

    " Southampton Blitz During the Second World War, Southampton was the subject of two major bombing raids, the first of which took place on the nights of 30 and 31 May 1940. The city was targeted because it was the home of the ocean liner SS Rex, which was being used as a troopship, and the aircraft carrier HMS Argus, which was in dock for repairs. The German raiders were escorted by a force of about 20 Messerschmitt Bf 110s from Norway, which had been modified to carry a 50-mm anti-ship gun under their wings. The first attack on Southampton came on the evening of 30 May. Twenty-three Heinkel He 111s, supported by 25 Messerschmitts, dropped 40 high-explosive and 16 incendiary bombs on the city. The Messerschmitts also attacked the city's docks with their 50-mm guns, and a number of hits were scored on the SS Rex. The ship's commanding officer, Captain F. A. Lewey, ordered the ship to be moved to a position where the 50-mm guns could not bear. The Messerschmitts were able to score only four more hits on the ship before they were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the ship and the surrounding area. The Heinkels were more successful, and by the morning of 31 May, the SS Rex was listing so badly that it had to be beached in the River Itchen. The Southampton Blitz After the attack on the SS Rex, the German aircraft turned their attention to other targets in the city. The Itchen Bridge was hit by two 50-mm shells, which caused it to collapse. This left the city's Floating Bridge as the only route across the river. The Germans also attacked the city's docks, and the oil tank at Woolston was set on fire. The German raid caused extensive damage to the city, with many buildings being destroyed or damaged. The Itchen Bridge was not the only bridge to be hit, as the Floating Bridge was also attacked. The bridge was hit by a number of bombs, which caused it to sink. The city's docks were also badly damaged, with many ships being sunk or damaged. The German aircraft returned to the city on the evening of 31 May for a second raid. This time they were more successful, as they were able to hit the SS Rex with a number of 50-mm shells. The ship was eventually beached in the River Itchen, and was later refloated and repaired. The Southampton Blitz was a major blow to the city, as it caused extensive damage and disruption. The city's docks were badly damaged, and many ships were sunk or damaged. The Itchen Bridge was also destroyed, which left the city's Floating Bridge as the only route across the river. The city was able to recover from the raid, but it was a major blow to the city's economy.",

    " An automatic weather station (AWS) is a weather station that takes regular, uniform, and frequent measurements of multiple weather variables, and records them at a given time interval, or at a specific time, using automated processes. The measurements are then used to calculate and issue weather forecasts, and to study the weather and climate. The first weather observations on a regular basis were taken manually, and the term weather station thus originally referred to any place where weather observations were taken. As the equipment to take automatic observations became available, the term automatic weather station was coined to specify a station where observations were obtained automatically. The variables measured by an automatic weather station are typically similar to those measured by a manual weather station, and can include temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, and amount of precipitation. In addition, an automatic weather station can measure soil temperature and moisture, and ocean parameters such as waves, tide levels, and sea surface temperature. Automatic weather stations can also measure other variables, such as visibility, atmospheric pressure, and ultraviolet (UV) index. Some weather stations are specialized and only measure one or two variables. The measurements taken at a weather station can be used to create weather reports and to issue weather warnings. They also form the basis for a wide variety of weather forecasting models used to forecast weather conditions. In addition, automatic weather stations can be used to study the weather and climate. The reliability of the data from an automatic weather station depends on the quality of the sensors, the placement of the station, and the availability of the power and telecommunications infrastructure to support it. Maintenance of the station is also important. The need for weather observations to be taken frequently, in a uniform manner, and at the same time of day each day, means that the process is best suited to being automated. The first instance of an automated process for taking weather observations was in 1747, when a mercury barometer was attached to a moveable arm, which was raised and lowered every day at the same time. The mercury barometer was thus placed in different atmospheric pressure zones every day at the same time, and the weather observations taken manually from the barometer every day at the same time could then be compared to previous days' observations. The first automatic weather station with a weather vane was constructed in the 1850s by Sir William Crookes, and the first automatic weather station that could record data was constructed in the 1860s by the Italian meteorologist Giovanni Cassini. Early automatic weather stations were set up by governments and research institutions, mostly in developed countries. In the 1930s, the first weather radar was developed, which enabled the detection of precipitation at a distance. Weather radars can be fixed or mobile, and can be used on ships, airplanes, and vehicles. The use of weather radar is particularly helpful for taking weather observations at night, when visibility is low. Many automated weather stations are part of a wider surface weather monitoring network, which are located at airports, marine ports, and other important locations. The most common weather variables measured by surface weather stations are: * air temperature and humidity * surface temperature (for ocean or soil) * atmospheric pressure * wind speed and direction * cloud cover * amount of precipitation * visibility * ultraviolet (UV) index A surface weather station can be equipped with additional sensors for other weather variables, such as: * ocean temperature and salinity * soil moisture and temperature * greenhouse gas concentrations * traffic conditions * lightning strike information * pollution (e.g., ozone and particulate matter) * noise level In addition, satellite data from a geostationary or polar-orbiting satellite can be used to supplement the data from surface weather stations, to obtain information on weather conditions over the oceans and remote areas, as well as information on the weather in the upper atmosphere. Weather radar data can also be used to supplement the data from surface weather stations, to obtain information on the weather within the atmosphere. When weather observations are taken automatically, the data obtained can be stored in a database, and can then be used in various ways. For example, the data can be used to issue weather forecasts, to issue severe weather warnings, and to study the weather and climate. The data can also be used in various weather forecasting models. Some weather stations are specialized and only measure one or two variables. For example, a station might measure just the wind speed and direction, or just the temperature and humidity. These stations are often called \"micro stations\". A weather station can be fixed ( stationery ), or mobile ( moving ). A fixed weather station is usually part of a network of weather stations that are spread over a large area, such as a country, state, region, or city. Fixed weather stations are often operated by a national weather service, and are",
    " Abbey of Santissima Trinità The Abbey of Santissima Trinità is a former monastery of the Latin Rite Catholic Church located in Venosa, in the province of Potenza, Basilicata, Italy. It was founded in 1083 by the Norman Robert Guiscard, who built a church and a monastery on the site of a preexisting Byzantine church dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The new foundation, which soon acquired considerable landed property, was named for the Trinity and was called a monastery, but it was really a convent for women, housing daughters and widows of the nobility of Southern Italy. The church was completely rebuilt in the 18th century, but the monastery has maintained the original Norman structure. The church has a single, barrel-vaulted nave with side chapels. The exterior has a simple architecture, with a plain facade and a bell tower with a cusp. The interior of the church has noteworthy paintings, including a large canvas by Marco Basaiti, a native of nearby Melfi. This painting, located on the left wall of the church, depicts the Dead Christ and the Marys. Also in the church are works by Giuseppe Fumana and Carlo Cozza, who painted the altarpiece of the main altar. Since the 1970s the monastery has been the subject of restoration work, which has cleared the surrounding area and has disclosed the presence of other buildings, including a mill and a hostel for travelers. The monastery has a small library with precious illuminated manuscripts. In 2010, the Abbey of Santissima Trinità was selected to be one of the locations for the shooting of the television series Un ponte per amico, which is broadcast by the Italian channel RTI.",
    " Garden designer A garden designer is someone who designs plans for gardens and other outdoor spaces. Garden designers may also use the term landscape architect. The term garden designer is pared with that of landscape architect in that both focus on the selection and production of plants. However, the main difference between the two is that a landscape architect focuses on the design of hard structures and other built aspects of a landscape, while a garden designer focuses on the selection and production of plants. Garden designers can be found working in a variety of settings. Some designers work for private homeowners, while others may work for large companies. Still, other garden designers may be self-employed. The work of a garden designer can range from simple to complex. For example, a garden designer may be hired to design a small flowerbed for a private residence. On the other hand, a garden designer may be hired to design a large park or other outdoor space. In addition to the design of plants and other aspects of a landscape, a garden designer may also be responsible for the construction of hard structures. For example, a garden designer may be responsible for the construction of a new pathway or the addition of a new structure to an existing landscape.",
    " Screw (orman-dane) A screw is a type of fastener, in some ways similar to a bolt, typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread. Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. Screws are used in many applications, such as to fasten metal parts together and to fasten metal to wood. In these applications, screws have largely replaced nails, where nails are still used. The largest user of screws is the residential housing industry, where screws are used both to fasten wood to wood and to fasten metal to wood. The basic design of a screw can be divided into four parts: the head, the neck, the body, and the tip. The head is the part of the screw that is used to turn it. The head can be a variety of shapes, such as a button or a cross. In some applications, such as with a screw driver, the head can be a standard shape so that a variety of different screws can be turned with the same tool. The neck is the unthreaded part of the screw that is directly below the head. It is typically used to attach the head to the body. The body is the part of the screw that is threaded for most of its length. The body typically has a constant diameter, although some screws, such as lag screws, have a tapered body. The tip is the end of the screw that is opposite the head. The tip is typically pointed to allow the screw to be started in a surface. There are many different types of screws, all designed for different applications. Common types of screws include: Wood screws: used to fasten wood to wood and wood to metal Metal screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood Self-tapping screws: used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole, sometimes called sheet metal screws Thread-forming screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood, also called thread-rolling screws Lag screws: used to fasten wood to wood Security screws: used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened In addition, there are many variants of the basic screw design, including: Screws with a variety of head designs Screws with a variety of body designs Screws with a variety of tip designs Screws used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood are sometimes called metal screws. Metal screws are similar to wood screws, except that the shaft is threaded for most of its length. Metal screws can be used with nuts or screwed directly into a threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Machine screws are similar to metal screws, except that they are designed to be used with a nut or threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Self-tapping screws are used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole. They are sometimes called sheet metal screws. Thread-forming screws are used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood. They are also called thread-rolling screws. Screws used to fasten wood to wood are sometimes called wood screws. Wood screws are similar to metal screws, except that the shaft is not threaded for most of its length. Wood screws are designed to be used with a pilot hole. Lag screws are similar to wood screws, except that they have a much thicker shaft and a blunt tip. They are used to fasten wood to wood. Security screws are designed to be used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened. Security screws are typically used to fasten a license plate to a car or to fasten the cover of a computer port. A screw is used to fasten things together by turning it in the direction that causes the screw to dig in and wedge into a material. The screw is typically inserted into a pre-drilled hole, and as the screw is turned, the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. The first use of screws to fasten metal is believed to have been in the 15th century, in the Visby ship. Screws were used to hold pieces of wood together in the 17th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to wood in the 18th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to metal in the 19th century. The largest user of screws is the residential housing industry.",
    " Alfred Robin (fl. 1120–1170) was an English medieval musician. Alfred Robin (or Robert) was born in England, possibly in London, and was a contemporary of the medieval composer and music theorist, Léonin. Robin was one of the early composers of organum, and his style is characterized by the use of drones and a certain amount of chromaticism. He may have been the teacher of the noted English composer, Thomas of England. Two of his works survive in the Old Hall Manuscript (British Library, Add. MS 5000), a collection of English music from the mid-12th century: a Magnus liber organi (Great book of organum) and a Nova organum experimentum (New book of organum). The Nova organum experimentum is in the form of a gradual, and the underlay of the parchment on which the music is written shows that it was originally part of a book of hours. The music of both works is in two-part organum. The styles of the two works are quite different, which has led scholars to suggest that they may have been written by different people. The composer of the Magnus liber organi is anonymous, but it has been suggested that this may be the work of Robin, as the style is similar to that of the Nova organum experimentum. Both works are edited and published in theCorpus Mensurabilis Musicae, vol. 72, by the Institute for Musicology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",

    " 2011 Los Angeles Angels season The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim had a very successful 2011 season, finishing with a record of 86–78. They finished the season in third place in the American League West, 17 games behind the division winner Texas Rangers. The third-place finish was the best the team had finished in the division since 1986, when the team finished in second place. The Angels made the playoffs for the second straight year, but lost to the Detroit Tigers in the American League Division Series. On October 3, 2010, the Angels hired Ron Washington to replace Mike Scioscia as manager. The move was controversial, as Scioscia had led the Angels to the only World Series title in franchise history in 2002, and the Angels made the playoffs in five of his 10 full seasons as manager. General manager Jerry Dipoto was fired by the Angels in October 2010, and was replaced by Billy Eppler. On May 6, 2011, the Angels promoted Mike Trout, a rookie outfielder, to their major league roster. Trout went on to win the American League Rookie of the Year Award, and make the All-Star Game.

The 46 wins in the second half of the season were the most by the Angels since the franchise moved to California in 1961. The Angels finished the season with an 86–78 record, good enough for third place in the American League West. The Angels made the playoffs for the second straight year. In the American League Division Series, the Angels faced the Detroit Tigers, who had finished the season with an 88–74 record, and had beaten the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Game.

    " Troubadour style Troubadour style (French: Style Troubadour) is a type of poetic developed in Southern France during the 12th century, characterized by the use of octo- and decasyllabic verse (the so-called \" vers\") with eight or ten syllables per line, a caesura after the fourth or sixth syllable, and with rhymes (in the final verse) after every line. The name derives from the French wordtrouvaille, meaning \"find\", and was first applied to the poems of theTrouvères. Troubadour style is usually found in love poetry, although there are also religious and political examples. The poetry is characterized by the presence of a theme, usually expressed in the first person, in the form of a quest, in which the troubadour searches for a love interest, usually a woman, although there are also examples of men as the object of desire. The quest may be successful or not, but the poem is always written in a positive tone. The first lines of a troubadour poem are usually the most difficult, and are used to introduce the subject of the poem. The next lines are usually easier, and are used to describe the journey, and the final lines are used to describe the object of the troubadour's desire. Troubadour style was very popular in France and Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, and was used by many poets, including theTrouvères, the Minnesänger, and the Dolce Stil Novo. Troubadour style differs from the earlier Anglo-Norman style in that it is usually octo- and decasyllabic, whereas the Anglo-Norman style is usually octo- and hendecasyllabic. It also differs from the later Petrarchan style in that it is usually not as complex or as condensed. Troubadour style is also used in Occitan, Catalan, Galician-Portuguese, and Spanish poetry. In music, a \"troubadour style\" or \"trouvère style\" is a type of song with a similar verse structure, usually with a repeating line, and with a refrain.",

    " Night Without End is a 1985 British horror film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Lee Montgomery, Ann Bell, David Collings, and Brian Glover. The film is set in the early 20th century and follows a series of murders in a German castle. The film was shot in Britain and West Germany. It was released in the United States as Time Without End. The film is set in a German castle in the early 20th century. The castle's owner, Count Karl Von Drummond (David Collings), invites several guests to stay with him for a hunting party. The guests include Scientists Sir Basil Thistleton (Montgomery), Professor Helius (Glover), and Dr. Max Nett (Jurgens), along with Count's sister, Baroness Elsa (Ann Bell), and Elsa's husband, Baron Karl (Michael Hoger). The castle's priest, Father Joseph (Leo Genn), and the Count's servant, Hoffman (Brendan Price), round out the guests. The film opens with a quote from William Blake: \"Tyger, tyger, burning bright, in the forests of the night; what immortal hand or eye, could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" A series of murders begin to occur, seemingly at random, and the guests begin to suspect that the Count is responsible. As the film progresses, it is revealed that the murders are connected, and that they are all part of a larger plot to be carried out by the Count. As the film reaches its climax, it is revealed that the Count has been carrying out the murders in an attempt to create a perfect being, a \"superior species\", by combining the best features of each of the guests. The Count's plan is to kill all of the guests and create this new species from their combined DNA. The new species will have the intelligence of Basil, the strength of the Baron, the compassion of Elsa, the religious faith of Father Joseph, and the servitude of Hoffman. The film ends with the Count killing the remaining guests and attempting to carry out his plan. However, the new species is born with a deformity, and the Count is killed by the angry mob that has gathered outside the castle.",
    " Lucas aggregate supply function The Lucas aggregate supply function is an economic model of the supply of aggregate goods and services by an economy. It was first developed by the British economist, Dennis Arthur Lucas (1920–2002), in his contribution to the Handbook of Macroeconomics, in 1982. Lucas subsequently developed the model in a number of papers, in which he showed how the model could be used to explain many features of the business cycle, such as the rationale for stabilization policy. The Lucas aggregate supply function is a development of the trend GDP model, which is a simple model in which the economy's output is represented as a trend (a long-term movement) plus a cyclical component. The Lucas aggregate supply function has two components: a trend component, which is determined by the size of the labour force and the capital stock, and a cyclical component, which is determined by the difference between the natural rate of unemployment and the actual rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is at its long-term trend rate of output. The Lucas aggregate supply function can be used to explain why economies can experience high unemployment for several years after a recession has started. This is because the cyclical component of the supply function shifts downward when the economy is in a recession, and it takes several years for the natural rate of unemployment to decline to the actual rate of unemployment.",

    " Two Against the World is a 1932 American pre-Code drama film directed by James Tinling and written by Frank Condon and James Tinling, adapted from the play by Frank Condon. The film stars Paul Lukas, Ann Dvorak, and Lee Tracy. It is based on the true story of a con man who was tried for killing a cardsharp, and was the basis for the 1952 film High Noon. In the small town of Yellow Sky, Texas, secretary Mary Joe Farrow (Ann Dvorak) is being courted by two men, one a local cattleman named Henry Drummond (Paul Lukas), the other a shifty stranger named Martin Bales (Lee Tracy). Mary Joe is aware that Bales has a reputation as a \"con man\" but he talks his way out of her suspicions, and she falls in love with him. When Bales' past catches up with him, he murders a cardsharp named Steve Ransom (Prudence Bradley) and escapes from the town with Mary Joe. The local sheriff, Jake Pierce ( Forrest Tucker), assembles a posse to go after Bales. The film is a chase film, similar to The Texas Rangers, with the addition of a love triangle. It differs from the later High Noon in that the hero is not a lawman, but an ordinary man on the run with a woman he loves. Two Against the World was the fourth film in a series of six \"A\" pictures for which 20th Century Fox borrowed Lee Tracy from M-G-M; the others were The Rich Man and the Poor Man, The Power and the Glory, The Mad Dog of Europe, Charlie Chan in London, and Hot Saturday.",

    " The 1998 Northern Territory referendum was a referendum held in the Northern Territory on Saturday, 30 November 1998, to determine whether the Northern Territory should become a state of Australia. A majority of the voters voted in favour of the question \"Are you in favour of the Northern Territory becoming a State?\" and the referendum passed. The result was 56.9% in favour (31,928 votes) and 43.1% against (22,232 votes). The Northern Territory was previously administered as part of the Northern Territory (NT) Australia Act 1978, which also provided for the possibility of the Territory becoming a state. The Act was amended in 1994 to provide that if the Territory was to become a state, it would be known as the Northern Territory. The Constitution of Australia did not provide for the creation of new states, and the legal questions surrounding the process were not completely settled. The referendum was the third attempt to make the Northern Territory a state, following earlier referendums in 1967 and 1974, which failed with 52% and 54% of the vote, respectively. The 1998 referendum resulted in a change to the Australian Constitution to allow the Northern Territory to become a state, if they so choose. The referendum also provided for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to become a state, if a majority of its voters so choose. However, unlike the Northern Territory, the ACT did not achieve the required majority, with the vote being 52% in favour and 48% against. The referendum also had other changes to the Constitution, including to provide that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be counted in the census and to allow the Australian Parliament to legislate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the Northern Territory.",
    " The Optimists of Nine Elms In the early part of the 20th century, a group of Jewish boxers based in the London borough of Lambeth, particularly in the area of Nine Elms, earned the nickname \"The Optimists of Nine Elms\" because of their cheerful attitude and their ability to always look on the bright side of things no matter how bad their circumstances were. The term was coined by the American boxer and manager Jack \"Kid\" Berg, who trained at the noted Jewish Lads' Club in the area. Berg explained that he had given the fighters this nickname because of their ability to stay positive and look to the future despite the fact that they were often poor and had problems with anti-Semitism.

    " Midget car racing, also known as dwarf car racing, is a form of auto racing which uses heavily modified versions of production cars, called midgets, to race on racing circuits, ice tracks, and on dirt tracks. The cars are powered by four-cylinder engines, and have a tubular frame, with the driver sitting in the center. The cars are very small, with a strict weight limit of 800 pounds (360 kg) without the driver. The sport's history can be traced back to the early 1920s, when the cars were used as a way to teach drivers the basics of racing. The cars were so small that they were often called \"dwarfs\" or \"midgets\", and the term \"midget car\" eventually became the official name of the sport. The cars are typically built for racing, with a tube frame and a fiberglass body. They are powered by a four-cylinder engine, and can reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h). The cars are raced on racing circuits, ice tracks, and on dirt tracks. In the United States, midget car racing is a form of auto racing that is popular in the Midwest.

    " Curtiss Tanager is a species of small passerine birds in the tanager family Thraupidae. It is the only species of the genus Curtissi. The species is endemic to western and north-western Peru. The Curtiss Tanager was first described by the American ornithologist Alexander Wetmore in 1934. It was named in honor of the American zoologist Earl Curtiss. The Curtiss Tanager is a small tanager, 11.5–12.5 cm long. The adult has a long, pale grey-white pointed bill, dark grey legs, a pale grey-white face and pale grey-white underparts. The upperparts are dark grey with a pale grey shoulder patch. The central tail feathers are longer than the lateral feathers. The male and female are similar. The Curtiss Tanager occurs in low-lying areas on the Pacific coast of Peru, from the Department of Tumbes in the north to the Department of Ica in the south, and also in the western part of the Department of Ancash in the Andes, at altitudes of up to 2,100 m. It prefers open areas such as fields, pasture, roadsides, and the edges of forests, where it can be seen solitary, or in pairs, or in small groups. The Curtiss Tanager feeds on nectar from the flowers of tall, thin-stemmed plants, and on small invertebrates such as insects, which it finds on the ground or in the bark of trees. The Curtiss Tanager is a seasonal breeder, with the season lasting from September to April. The nest is built by the female alone, and is a small cup shape made of grass and moss lined with mud. It is placed in a low fork of a tree or bush. Two eggs are laid, and are pale blue-green with brown spots. The nest and eggs are preyed on by snakes and monkeys. The Curtiss Tanager is uncommon and localised, and is declining as its forest habitat is cleared for agriculture and settlement. It is therefore classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN.",

    " The Battle of Smolensk was a battle of the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 17 August 1812 between the Russian Empire and the French invasion. The battle took place near the city of Smolensk, 350 kilometres (220 mi) west of Moscow, on the Dnieper River, one of the major tributaries of the Volga, which the French crossed on their way to the capital. After their victory in the Battle of Valutino, the Russian forces under General Nikolai Ivanov prepared a defensive line along the Dnieper, hoping to halt the French advance. The French forces, under Napoleon, instead launched a rapid offensive, attempting to bypass the Russian lines by crossing the Dnieper at a point 30 kilometres (19 mi) east of Smolensk. The Russians were unprepared for this move, and the French broke through, winning a victory and inflicting heavy casualties on the Russians. Despite the victory, the French offensive had exhausted their supply of food and ammunition, and the Russians were able to withdraw most of their forces intact. The French suffered from desertion and disease, and were now significantly behind schedule. The battle was the first of three major battles between the French and the Russians in August 1812, preceding the Battle of Borodino and the Battle of Moscow, and was the first of five major battles the French forces would fight in the three-week period from 16 August to 6 September. After the capture of Smolensk, the French were able to replenish their food and ammunition, and the Russians were forced to retreat.

The Russians, meanwhile, had been able to withdraw most of their forces and had preserved their strength. As a result, the French were unable to press their advantage, and the Russians were able to withdraw in good order to their new defensive positions along the Moscow-Smolensk highway.",

    " Bulls, New Zealand, is a small town in the centre of the North Island, and is the service centre for the Rangitikei District. It is located 20 kilometres (12 mi) south-west of Taihape, and 90 kilometres (56 mi) north-east of Palmerston North. The town has a population of 1,128 as of the 2006 Census, and is the seat of the Rangitikei District Council. The town's name is believed to have originated from a legend in which a bull was killed there after swimming the river during a flood. The Bulls area was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s, with the Moutoa Gardens area, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north-east of the present town, being the site of the first European habitation in the district. The town was founded in 1870 after the arrival of the railroad, and the original site of the town was at the intersection of Railway and High Streets, where the train station was located. The town was moved to its present site when the New Zealand Government completed the new railway line to Wellington in 1885. The original town was then demolished to make way for the present day town, with the old town's main street becoming the new town's High Street. The town is located on State Highway 1, and is also on the North Island Main Trunk railway line. It has a small railway station that is no longer in use, as the nearest station is in Taihape. The town has a number of historic buildings, including the Bulls Hotel, built in 1885, and the Empire Hotel, built in 1912. The town's high school, Bulls High School, was closed in 2007, but the town still has a primary school. Bulls was the original home of the international company Zespri, which was founded in the town in 1908 as the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board. The company's headquarters are now located in Mount Maunganui, and the company is now known as Zespri International.",
    " MN1 (gene) The MN1 gene (mobile element derived 1 gene) is a gene that codes for the protein Meis1. The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (20p11.2). It spans 3.3 kb and comprises 3 exons and 2 introns. The MN1 gene encodes a protein called Meis1, a DNA-binding protein that is a transcription factor and regulator of cell differentiation and growth control. The gene is expressed in all tissues, with higher levels in testis and lower levels in kidney. The MN1 gene is evolutionarily conserved, with homologs in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In humans, the gene has 4 alternatively spliced variants, 3 of which encode the same protein and 1 that is a pseudogene. The MN1 gene is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is a transcription factor that binds to the DNA and regulates the expression of target genes. The gene is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell growth, and cell differentiation. The MN1 gene is associated with the development of several cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. The gene is also associated with the development of Wilms' tumor, a type of kidney cancer. The MN1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which means that it helps to regulate cell growth and differentiation and can prevent cells from becoming cancerous.

This was the nation's eighth appearance in the Winter Olympics. The Brazilian delegation consisted of three athletes, two of whom were female, and the other male. Two athletes, one male and one female, were making their second consecutive appearance in the Winter Games, having also competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics. The athletes competed in three sports: bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, and snowboarding. Brazil's best performance at these games was by the bobsleigh team, who came twentieth in the four-man event and twenty-first in the two-man event. This was an improvement on the last Winter Olympics, where the country's best result was thirty-seventh in the two-man bobsleigh. The other two athletes failed to advance beyond the qualification stages of their respective events. This was the first time that Brazil had competed in bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics, and the first time since 1928 that the country had participated in cross-country skiing. Brazil had previously competed in snowboarding at the 1998 Winter Olympics.",
    " Real-time text Real-time text is text that is input or output immediately after its creation, as opposed to text that is stored and then displayed. Real-time text is a key feature of live streaming and live transcription, in which a person types what another person says. Real-time text may be created with a real-time text editor. One of the first uses of this technology was the Telestrator, which was invented by Martin Cooke in 1961. The Telestrator was a device that allowed one to draw on a television screen in real-time. It was first used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to annotate a television broadcast of the Canadian federal election in 1962. The technology was also used in the United States to annotate the America's Cup yacht races in 1967. Real-time text is used in instant messaging, online chat, and teletype. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was also used in the now-obsolete field of real-time document preparation, which was an alternative to the more familiar batch processing model of document preparation. Real-time text is also used in captioning and subtitling.",

The resort is located in the Tsugaru region of Aomori Prefecture, on the eastern edge of the Hakkōda Mountains. The hot springs are one of the more famous hot spring resorts in the region, and are one of the few that are easily accessible by a paved road. The hot springs are located along the cottony dogwood tree-lined Towada-Hachimantai National Highway. There are many onsen ryokan in the area. The sulfur springs are colored in shades of green and are said to be good for skin ailments. In the past, the springs were located along the road, but due to their popularity, most of the springs have been developed into bathhouses and ryokan. The springs are still considered to be one of the best free hot springs in the region. The springs can be found by following the road to the end, where there is a large bathhouse, the Sakuraya Bathhouse, which is free to enter. The bathhouse has a strong sulfur smell, but the water is clear. The temperature is very hot, reaching above 50 degrees Celsius. The resort is also known for its \"onsen eggs\", a local specialty in which eggs are hard-boiled in the hot spring water. The sulfur in the water turns the egg shells black, and the egg whites turn a light green. Onsen eggs are a popular local tourist souvenir, and can be found at many tourist shops in the area. Tōgō Onsen is a popular destination for tourists, especially during the summer months. The resort is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, as it is home to a variety of bird species, including the endangered Japanese woodpecker. The resort is approximately 40 minutes by car from Hirosaki, and can also be accessed by a local bus service. The nearest train station is the JR Tsugaru-Goshogawara Station, which is approximately 25 minutes away by car.",

    " Otto Strasser (26 May 1897 – 6 June 1939) was an Austrian political activist and an early member of the Nazi Party. He was the younger brother of the party's founder and leader, Adolf Hitler. After the Nazi takeover of power in Germany in 1933, Strasser became disenchanted with the movement and broke with his brother. He was killed in mysterious circumstances in 1939. Strasser was born in Linz, Upper Austria, the fourth of the six children of Maria Augusta (née Schickelgruber) and Alois Hitler. His father was a customs official. TheHitler family was Catholic, and Otto was raised in that faith. He attended the state school in Linz and, like his older brother, Adolf, went on to the Linz Realschule. After completing his schooling there in 1916, he served in the Austrian Army from May to October that year, and was then transferred to the reserves. In December, he was called up for active service again, but was discharged in February 1917 because of heart problems. In June, he was conscripted into the German Army and fought on the Western Front until the end of the war. He was wounded in October 1918. After the war, Strasser completed his schooling and, like his brother, failed to gain admission to the Austrian officer academy. He then joined the right-wing Austrian Home Defence and served as a private. The following year, he became a member of the German National Socialist Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or NSDAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and the German Workers' and Soldiers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiter- und Soldatenpartei, or DAP), which the NSDAP soon absorbed. The NSDAP was then led by his brother, and the party's newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, was edited by Joseph Goebbels. In 1921, Strasser became the business manager of the newspaper. After the NSDAP's poor showing in the Reichstag elections of May 1924, Strasser, along with his brother and other party leaders, was convicted of treason in the Bamberg Court of Honor. The sentence, however, was not carried out, as the President of the Reichsgericht, Ludwig Guertner, granted an indefinite delay of execution. In the summer of 1924, Strasser joined the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei, or DVP). The following year, he became the business manager of the Deutsche Zeitung, a newspaper published by the DVP's successor, the National Party (Nationale Partei, or NP). He also managed the NP's affairs in Munich. In the autumn of 1925, the NP merged with the NSDAP to form the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or NSDA), which would be renamed the Nazi Party in 1933. Strasser remained a member of the new party, and in 1926 was appointed to its leadership in Munich. He also became the business manager of the Völkischer Beobachter, which was now the Nazi Party's newspaper, and, in 1927, the head of the party's publishing house, the Franz Eher Verlag. Strasser was one of the few early Nazi Party leaders who was not a member of the SA. He was, however, involved in the leadership of the party's economic organizations, and in 1928 became the chairman of the Business and Property Owners' Committee. In 1929, he became the head of the party's Economic Policy and Tax Office. The following year, he was elected to the Reichstag for the Munich North seat, and was made the chairman of the Nazi faction in the Bavarian Landtag. In the Reichstag, he sat on the Economic Committee and on the Committee on the Affairs of the German People's Group in Poland. In the Landtag, he was on the Committee for Economic and Agricultural Affairs. In February 1932, Strasser became the Nazi Party's propaganda chief, a position he would hold until his death. In March, he was made the party's organizational chief, and in May its business manager. In the Reichstag elections of July 1932, he was elected to represent Munich North. In November, he was elected to the Reichstag for Munich North and Munich II. In the Landtag elections, he was returned to the Bavarian legislature from Munich North. After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Strasser was named to the Reich government as Minister without Portfolio and as Deputy Minister of Transport. In the summer of 1933, he was elected to the Reichstag for Munich II. Strasser was the only one of the four Hitler brothers who was not killed in the Holocaust. However, his widow, Hedwig, was killed",

    " Ferdinand Johann Adam von Pernau (9 October 1756 – 26 December 1815) was a German philosopher and writer. He is best known for his book Das Leben des Jesus, a philosophical and historical account of the life of Jesus which has been described as the most important German philosophical investigation of the life of Jesus during the nineteenth century. After studying theology and philosophy at the universities of Halle and Jena, Pernau became a private tutor to a noble family in Thuringia. In 1791 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Rinteln, where he remained for the rest of his life. In Das Leben des Jesus (1806), Pernau offered a philosophical and historical account of the life of Jesus in which he sought to penetrate the historical figure of Jesus through the various legends and myths that had accumulated around him. In doing so, he made use of the methods of the historical-critical study of the New Testament that had been developed by the German philosopher and critic David Hume. Pernau's work met with a hostile reception from the faculty of the University of Rinteln, who were scandalized by the idea that the life of Jesus might be subject to rational investigation. In spite of this, the book was widely read and had a significant influence on the historical-critical study of the New Testament during the nineteenth century. In addition to Das Leben des Jesus, Pernau also wrote several philosophical treatises on such topics as theodicy, the relation between philosophy and religion, and the history of philosophy.",

    " Accumulated cyclone energy The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index is an indicator of the collective destructive power of storms that occurred over a region during a particular period of time. The index value is calculated by squaring the wind speed of each storm, multiplying by the storm's duration, and then summing these values. The ACE index does not represent the damage that might have been caused by the storms, but instead provides a means of comparing the destructive potential of different sets of storms. The index was first developed in 1987 by Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to provide a single value that could be used to compare the destructive potential of multiple storms that occurred over a region during a single season. The index has since been used to compare the destructive potential of storms in different regions and at different times. The ACE index is typically calculated for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The index can also be calculated for other regions, such as the Indian Ocean, but in these cases the storms that are included in the index may not be true tropical cyclones. The ACE index is used by meteorologists to provide a simple and consistent measure of the destructive potential of tropical cyclones. It is also used by researchers to study the physical processes that occur within tropical cyclones and to improve the computer models that are used to predict the tracks and intensity of these storms. The ACE index is not without its limitations, however. The index is only calculated for regions where sufficient wind speed data are available. In addition, the index does not take into account the size of the storm, the amount of rainfall that it produced, or the extent of the storm's circulation. These factors can all have a significant impact on the destructive potential of a tropical cyclone.",
    " Hurricane Harvey was a deadly and destructive Category 4 hurricane that became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and the first in Texas since Hurricane Ike in 2008. Harvey was the seventh hurricane to make landfall in the United States in 2017, the most since 2004. On August 17, 2017, a tropical depression formed over the Atlantic Ocean from a low-pressure area that had been present for several days. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm the next day as it moved northwestward. On August 19, the storm reached hurricane intensity, and by August 21, it reached Category 4 intensity. Harvey weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland, but restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it moved back over the Gulf of Mexico. On August 25, Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), and it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland. Harvey caused catastrophic flooding in Texas, particularly in and around Houston, which was hit by the eye of the storm. Harvey is estimated to have caused $75 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane in United States history. The storm caused at least 68 deaths and nearly 200,000 people were displaced. On August 23, the Hurricane Harvey Task Force, consisting of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies, was formed to support the recovery from the hurricane. The task force was headed by FEMA director Brock Long.",

    " In baseball, a count, or the count, is the number of balls and strikes on a batter. The count is sometimes described as the number of balls, the number of strikes, or the sum of the two (e.g., \"the count is three balls and two strikes\"). A count starts at 0-0, with the first pitch being either a ball or a strike. A count of three balls or three strikes is considered an \"out\" and results in a strikeout if the batter does not hit a fair ball before the fielders can record the out. If the batter gets four balls on a walk, it is considered an \"unassisted\" walk, and if the batter gets four strikes it is considered a \"strikeout\". If the batter has fewer than three balls and fewer than three strikes, the count is said to be \"in the strike zone\". If the batter has fewer than three balls and more than three strikes, the count is \"out of the strike zone\". If the batter has more than three balls and fewer than three strikes, the count is \"ball-out-of-the-strike-zone\", and if the batter has more than three balls and more than three strikes, the count is \"ball-ball-out-of-the-strike-zone\". If the batter has fewer than three balls, the count is described as \"no balls\", \"one ball\", \"two balls\", or \"three balls\". If the batter has more than three balls, the count is described as \"four balls\" or \"five balls\". If the batter has three balls, the count is described as \"three balls\" or \"full count\". A count of zero balls and two strikes is called a \"no-pitch\". If a batter is walked on eight balls, it is considered a \"Passed ball\". If the batter has zero strikes, the count is described as \"no strikes\", \"one strike\", \"two strikes\", or \"three strikes\". If the batter has one strike, the count is described as \"one strike\" or \"two strikes\". If the batter has two strikes, the count is described as \"two strikes\" or \"three strikes\". If the batter has three strikes, the count is described as \"three strikes\" or \"Strike out\".",
    " Paul Karrer (April 16, 1889 – December 21, 1945) was a Swiss organic chemist and the recipient of the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on carotenoids and vitamins. Karrer was born in Wildberg, Switzerland, to a family of eight children. He attended the Kantonsschule in Schiers, the nearest town to his village, and then the high school in Sion. He went on to study chemistry at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and then at the universities of Zurich and Berlin. He received his Dr. Phil. in 1912, and his Dr. sc. nat. in 1914, the latter under the supervision of Richard Willstätter at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin. He then spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow with Professor Richard Kuhn in Zurich and, in 1915, returned to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where he remained for the next eight years. In 1923 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, a position he held for the rest of his life. Karrer's research focused on the structure and properties of natural products, especially those containing large rings. He was the first to determine the structures of carotenoids and of vitamin A, and he was also the first to show that vitamin A is a metabolite of carotene. His work on carotenoids and vitamin A led to the development of a practical synthesis for vitamin A and to the elucidation of the structure of vitamin B. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Karrer received the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's Einstein Medal, the German Chemical Society's Liebig Medal, the French Academy of Sciences' Lavoisier Medal, and the Royal Society of Chemistry's Faraday Medal.

    " Coyote Valley is a valley in San Benito County, California, United States, formed by the cooperation of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay during the creation of the Central Valley of California. The northern part of the valley is known as the Santa Clara Valley, and the southern part of the valley is known as the San Benito Valley. The two valleys are divided by the Diablo Range. The total area of the Coyote Valley is about 968 square miles (2,476 km2). The Coyote Valley is a critical wildlife corridor connecting the Monterey Bay with the San Francisco Bay and is the largest area of protected open space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The valley is home to a number of rare and endangered plants and animals. The natural landscape of the Coyote Valley is mostly grassland, with coastal scrub and riparian areas along the numerous creeks and rivers. The soil is mostly a hard, compact, earthquake-formed bay mud, which makes up the majority of the Central Valley of California. The main stem of the Coyote Creek flows from the San Francisco Bay to the Monterey Bay. The creek is about 65 miles (105 km) long, and is one of the largest tributaries of the San Francisco Bay. The creek's source is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and it flows south through the San Francisco Bay Area's South Bay region, then east through the Central Valley, joining the San Benito River near the city of San Benito. The San Benito River is a tributary of the Pajaro River, flowing from the Central Valley to the Monterey Bay. The river is about 65 miles (105 km) long. The river's source is in the Diablo Range, and it flows south through the Central Valley, joining the Coyote Creek near the city of San Benito, then continuing south to the Pajaro River at the city of Watsonville. The valley was first settled by the Ohlone people, who lived in a number of small bands in the area. The Ohlone lived in a culture of hunter-gatherers, with some fishing and limited agriculture. The first European settlers arrived in the 1700s, when the Spanish mission system was established in California. The Spanish friars established the San Juan Bautista Mission in the San Benito Valley, about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the Pajaro River. The Spanish established the first pueblo, or town, in California at San Jose in the northern part of the Coyote Valley. The town of San Juan Bautista was established in 1849, and is the oldest town in the valley. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought a large number of immigrants to the area, and the population of San Jose grew rapidly. The discovery of gold also drew people to the southern part of the valley, and the towns of Tres Pinos and Paicines were established in the early 1850s. The San Benito Valley was a major transportation corridor during the early days of California. The El Camino Real, the main road from San Francisco to Monterey, ran through the valley. The San Benito Valley was also the main route for the Butterfield Overland Mail, which was the first transcontinental mail service in the United States. The Butterfield Overland Mail used the San Andreas Lake bed as a portion of the route, which ran through the valley from 1858 to 1861. The San Benito Valley is also home to a number of rare and endangered plants and animals. The Diablo Range is home to the California red-legged frog and the San Benito Evening-primrose. The San Francisco Bay and the San Benito River are important habitat areas for the California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The valley is also home to a number of protected areas. The San Francisco Bay Area has a number of regional parks and preserves, including the South Bay Salt Ponds, Alviso Slough, and the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The Central Valley has the Sunol Regional Park and the Blue Hills Regional Park. The San Benito Valley has the San Benito National Wildlife Refuge and the Bitterwater National Wildlife Refuge. The Coyote Valley is also home to a number of farms and ranches, and the area is known for its agriculture and livestock. The region is known for its production of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and wine grapes. The valley is also home to a number of cattle ranches, and the region is known for its production of beef, dairy products, and wool.

    " Preprophase is the period prior to prophase in the meiotic cell cycle. The cells are in G1 phase. Meiosis-specific DNA replication (i.e., meiosis I) has not yet begun. The homologous chromosomes are not yet close to each other and are still in their allocated areas of the cell nucleus. In meiosis, the homologous chromosomes ( chromosomes that carry genes for the same traits) line up in rows. Each row contains two homologous chromosomes, one from each parent. The homologous chromosomes swap genetic information between each other. Meiosis is necessary to create genetic diversity. In mitosis, the homologous chromosomes line up in rows as well. However, in mitosis, the homologous chromosomes do not swap genetic information. Instead, the same genetic information is copied and the cell divides into two identical daughter cells. Mitosis is necessary for growth and for the repair of damaged tissue. Preprophase is the first stage of meiosis. In this stage, the homologous chromosomes are not close to each other and are not swapped. Meiosis begins when the homologous chromosomes are pulled close together.",

    " Legend tripping is a term that was coined in the late 1960s by Professor of Folklore Michael Owen Jones to describe the contemporary practice of visiting the locations of urban legends and other folklore. The term is sometimes used to describe the visiting of historical sites, for example, the location of the Alamo. A legend trip may be undertaken with the specific purpose of visiting the site of a legendary event, or it may be an incidental aspect of a journey. The latter is especially true of legends which are set in a specific landscape, such as the roads of the United States, the moors of England, or the hydrotherapy spa of Bath, England. The term \"legend trip\" also refers to the tradition of telling the story associated with a particular site, and the legends associated with a place may change according to the storyteller. Some legends are associated with many locations, and it is the repetition of the story, rather than the location, that is important to the storytellers. The act of visiting the site of a legend has been incorporated into many works of popular culture. In the 1990s, the Kansas-based band The Get Up Kids released a song entitled \"Oh My God, I Love America\", which includes the lyrics \"Where's the bathroom where Kurt Cobain took his life? / Oh, my God, I love America\". The song references the urban legend that Kurt Cobain, the former lead singer of Nirvana, killed himself in a bathroom stall in Detroit. Similarly, the band New Kids on the Block released an album entitled No More Games/No More Songs, which featured a song entitled \"You Got It Wrong\", whose lyrics include \"Where's the spot where John F. Kennedy was shot? / They got it wrong, they got it all wrong\". The song references the urban legend that the grassy knoll in Dallas, Texas, was the location where John F. Kennedy was shot, rather than the street in front of the knoll. Many legends are also associated with specific tourist locations, such as the World's Largest Ball of Twine in Kansas, the alleged location of the Bermuda Triangle in the Caribbean, and the alleged birthplace of Elvis Presley in Tupelo, Mississippi. In the United States, legend tripping is most often associated with young people. There is some evidence that young people are more likely to believe in urban legends than are older people. The term \"legend tripping\" can also refer to the act of visiting the site of a legendary event that never occurred. These trips are motivated by the same desire to experience a legendary event, and such trips are usually undertaken with the full knowledge that the event never occurred at the site. A famous example of a legend trip of this sort is the visit to the grave of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in the village of Freshwater, England. Tennyson's poem, \"Crossing the Bar\", contains the lines \"And the bar down under, I see, is a bar down under the sea, Down under the sea, I go, With a bar down under the sea\". Tennyson died in 1892, but tourists have been visiting the village and asking locals where Tennyson's grave is. Since there is no such grave, the tourists are directed to a concrete block on the beach, which has been identified as \"Tennyson's Tomb\" by the addition of a large cross, constructed from driftwood, to the top of the block.",
    " Linear park of the Saint-Charles and Berger rivers The Linear park of the Saint-Charles and Berger rivers (in French: Parc linéaire des rivières Saint-Charles et Berger) is a greenway in Quebec, Canada. It is a mixed-use recreational and transportation corridor, following the path of two rivers, and passing through the city of Quebec and the borough of La Cité-Limoilou. The park runs along the Saint-Charles River and its tributary, the Berger River. The two rivers flow into the St. Lawrence River at Quebec. The park is a continuation of the Samuel-de-Champlain Promenade, which runs along the St. Lawrence through the Quebec region, and which is also mixed-use. The park is used by residents of Quebec City for cycling, inline skating, walking, and cross-country skiing. In the winter, it is also used for snowshoeing and snowmobiling. The park passes through or near several major tourist attractions in Quebec City. It passes through the Plains of Abraham, which are the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. It passes near the Museum of Fine Arts, the National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec, and the Quebec Aquarium. It also passes near the shopping areas of Place Laurier and Place Ste-Foy. The park was created in the early 1970s. It was first named the Samuel-de-Champlain Linear Park, after the explorer Samuel de Champlain.

    " Guitar Tango is the name given to a style of playing the guitar which emulates the characteristic rhythmic and melodic elements of Argentine tango music. In its most characteristic form, the genre is performed on an acoustic guitar with the melody and rhythm taken from an arrangement for bandoneón, the characteristic instrument of the tango orchestras. In the early years of the 20th century, when the tango became the most characteristic music of Argentina, there were many experiments with instruments other than the bandoneón to play the new music. The guitar was an obvious choice, since it was a common instrument and, at that time, the main instrument for the traditional Argentine music, the chamamé. The first person to arrange the tango for the guitar was the Mexican guitarist and composer Luis null. His arrangements, published in 1912, were the first to be titled \"Tango Argentino\" and they include the tango \"Marinera\", which is still widely played today. Luis null's most famous pupil was the Argentine guitarist and composer Edmundo Rivero, who also played a fundamental role in the development of the guitar style. Other important guitarists were the Mexican Joaquín Bueso, the Argentine tomato and the Brazilian Laurindo de Almeida. The guitar style is characterized by a strong rhythm, with a clear and bright sound, which allows the instruments to be heard within the crowded dance hall. To achieve this, the guitarist uses the whole body of the guitar as a resonating chamber, to give volume and depth to the sound. In the traditional ensemble, the guitarist is accompanied by a singer, a bandoneón, a violin, an accordion and a piano. The singer usually sings in a low voice, in a special way of singing that is characteristic of the tango. The guitar is used to play the melody, the rhythm or both at the same time. There are two ways to play the guitar in tango. The first one is called \"tangogauche\" (from French \"à gauche\" — to the left). The bandoneón is placed to the left of the guitarist, who therefore plays the bass to the left of the treble. The second way is called \"tangoforte\" (from Italian \"forte\" — strong). The bandoneón is placed to the right of the guitarist, who therefore plays the bass to the right of the treble. The tango style is a rich and complex musical idiom, which has been influenced by the cultural melting pot that is Argentina. It has also been influenced by the diverse peoples that have visited the country, such as the French, the Italians and the African slaves. The most characteristic element of the tango is the rhythm, which is in a 2/4 time signature. The rhythm is characterized by a \" delaying \" of the second beat, which gives the characteristic \"dilepton\" sound to the tango. This delaying is called \"canto\", and it is the most difficult element to be mastered by a musician who is not accustomed to the tango. The tango is also characterized by the \"tinta\" (Spanish for \"tone\"), which is the particular way in which the musician sings the notes, with a strong accent on the first beat of every measure. Another characteristic element is the \"llok\" (from Welsh \"lliw\" — melody), which is the way in which the musicians play the melody, with a clear and bright sound. Finally, the \"par\" (from French \"parade\" — walking) is the way in which the musicians play the rhythm, with a strong and steady beat. The traditional tango is made up of five parts: The \"A\" section, which is the most characteristic part of the tango, and it is usually the first part of the dance. It is characterized by the \"canto\" and the \"tinta\". The \"B\" section, which is a variation of the \"A\" section, and it is usually the second part of the dance. It is characterized by the \"llok\" and the \"par\". The \"C\" section, which is a transition between the \"B\" section and the \"A\" section, and it is usually the third part of the dance. It is characterized by the \"canto\" and the \"tinta\". The \"D\" section, which is a variation of the \"C\" section, and it is usually the fourth part of the dance. It is characterized by the \"llok\" and the \"par\". The \"E\" section, which is the final part of the dance. It is characterized by the \"canto\" and the \"tinta\". The traditional tango is usually danced with a partner, in a closed embrace. The basic step is very simple, and it is characterized",

    " Convergence of measures In probability theory and analysis, the convergence of measures is a property that is closely related to the convergence of random variables and probability distributions. A measure is a function that assigns a value to every subset of a set. A measure is called convergent if, as the index approaches infinity, the measure of the union of a sequence of sets approaches the measure of their intersection. More precisely, let (Ω, μ, ∞) be a measure space, where Ω is the set of all possible outcomes, μ is the associated measure, and ∞ is the infinite index. Let (Ωn, μn, n) be a sequence of measure spaces with μn ≡ μ(Ωn) and let (Ω ∞, μ ∞) be the measure space with μ ∞ ≡ lim(μn). Then μn is called a convergent measure if the following condition is satisfied: for every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, it holds that μn(Ω) ≥ μ ∞(Ω) + ε. A measure is called absolute convergent if it is convergent and μ ∞ is equal to μ. Let (Ω, μ, ∞) be a measure space. The following statements are equivalent: The measure μ is convergent. For every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, it holds that μn(Ω) ≥ μ ∞(Ω) + ε. For every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, it holds that μn(Ω) ≤ μ ∞(Ω) + ε. The measure μ is absolutely convergent. For every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, it holds that μn(Ω) = μ ∞(Ω) + ε.",

    " An open wagon, known by heritage railway enthusiasts as a \"Summer Carriage\", is a type of railway carriage designed for use in the warmer months of the year. Although the exact definition of what constitutes an open wagon is somewhat disputed, the general consensus is that open wagons are designed with at least one side fully open to the elements, and are thus not protected from the weather. The most common type of open wagon is the brake van, which is used to provide protection to the train's brake equipment and to provide a viewpoint for the train's guard. In the UK, open wagons are generally used to carry freight, and are not used for passenger services, unlike in other countries, such as France and Italy, where open wagons are used for both passenger and freight services. In the US, open wagons are used for both passenger and freight services. The most common types of open wagons in the US are the gondola, a freight-only vehicle, and the passenger car, which is used for passengers. In the UK, the most common type of open wagon is the brake van, which is used to provide protection to the train's brake equipment and to provide a viewpoint for the train's guard. The brake van is usually located at the rear of the train, and is designed with a fully open side facing the direction of travel. The brake van may also have a fully open roof, and is thus not protected from the weather. Brake vans are used on both passenger and freight trains, and are particularly common on heritage railways, which often use vintage vehicles. Brake vans are usually built with a wooden body, and may be built with either a roof or an open top. The most common type of brake van is the \"Grange\" brake van, which was built by the Great Western Railway in the early 20th century, and was designed to be used on both passenger and freight trains. The Grange brake van is built with a wooden body, and has a fully open side facing the direction of travel. The Grange brake van is used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains, due to its distinctive appearance. Another common type of brake van is the \"Lambton\" brake van, which was built by the London and North Eastern Railway in the early 20th century, and was designed to be used on both passenger and freight trains. The Lambton brake van is built with a wooden body, and has a fully open side facing the direction of travel. The Lambton brake van is used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains, due to its distinctive appearance. Open wagons are also used for carrying freight. The most common type of open wagon for carrying freight is the gondola, which is a vehicle with a fully open top, and is designed for carrying bulk materials, such as coal, ore, or grain. The gondola is usually loaded from the top, and may be equipped with a front-end loader for loading bulk materials. The gondola is used for carrying both passengers and freight, and is particularly common in the US, where it is used for carrying bulk materials. The gondola is also used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains, due to its distinctive appearance. Another common type of open wagon for carrying freight is the hopper, which is a vehicle with a fully open bottom, and is designed for carrying bulk materials, such as coal, ore, or grain. The hopper is usually loaded from the bottom, and may be equipped with a rear-end loader for loading bulk materials. The hopper is used for carrying both passengers and freight, and is particularly common in the US, where it is used for carrying bulk materials. The hopper is also used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains, due to its distinctive appearance. Open wagons are also used for carrying passengers. The most common type of open wagon for carrying passengers is the passenger car, which is a vehicle designed for carrying passengers, and is usually built with a fully enclosed body for protection from the weather. The passenger car is used for carrying both passengers and freight, and is particularly common in the US, where it is used for carrying passengers. The passenger car is also used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains, due to its distinctive appearance. Another common type of open wagon for carrying passengers is the open car, which is a vehicle designed for carrying passengers, and is usually built with a fully open body for exposure to the elements. The open car is used for carrying both passengers and freight, and is particularly common in the US, where it is used for carrying passengers. The open car is also used on heritage railways, and is a popular choice for use on passenger trains",
    " 'Bravo! Brubeck!' is a 1967 album by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The title is an anagram of the group's name. The cover was designed by Dave Brubeck himself. The album was recorded in 1967, at the time that the Dave Brubeck Quartet were recording their 'Time Out' album (their first album for Warner Bros.), and was originally released on the Fantasy Records label. The original cover was designed by the renowned San Francisco-based graphic designer, Alexander Isley. The album was re-released on CD in 2005, with the addition of three bonus tracks, including a rare performance of 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' by Paul Desmond, which was recorded live at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival. The title track, 'Bravo! Brubeck!', was recorded in a single take, and features Paul Desmond on alto saxophone, Paul Smith on bass, and Colin Bailey on drums. The song is a self-reference, and features a musical anagram of the group's name. The song is in fact a Desmond solo piece, with the group joining in for the last eight bars. 'Dancin' in the Night' is a Brubeck original, which was also recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet for their 'Time Out' album, but which was not used. The piece was inspired by Brubeck's recent experience of hearing gospel music in a black church in Washington, D.C. 'Ode to a Legend' is a Paul Desmond composition, dedicated to the recently deceased jazz legend, Lester Young. The piece is a bossa nova, and features a solo by Desmond. 'S'crazy Pad' is another Brubeck original, which features a rare Brubeck solo. 'Blue 7' is a blues by Paul Desmond, which is performed by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, but which was also recorded by Desmond with the Robert Gordon Quartet, and which was used as the theme tune for a TV show in the United States. 'For All We Know' is a Brubeck-Desmond composition, which was recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet for their 'Time Out' album, but which was not used. The piece was featured in the film 'Good Times', and was also recorded by the Carpenters. 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' is a single by Bobby McFerrin with the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which was released in 1988. The song was written by Bobby McFerrin and Roger Brown, and was recorded at the 1988 Montreaux Jazz Festival, with Paul Desmond, who had recently returned to the group.",
    " Indirect DNA damage Indirect DNA damage, or indirect DNA injury, is a form of DNA damage that is not directly caused by an external agent. Rather, it is caused by a chain of reactions, which can be initiated by a variety of external agents, including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and non-ionizing radiation, as well as chemical agents and viruses. The type of DNA damage produced will depend on the type of external agent, the dose, and the cellular context. The end result is a modification of the DNA that can lead to genetic instability, which means that the genetic information encoded in the DNA is no longer stably transmitted from one generation to the next. Indirect DNA damage can result in a variety of genetic alterations, including point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and gene deletions. These genetic alterations can lead to cell death, genetic instability, and cancer. The main way that indirect DNA damage causes genetic alterations is through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that can damage DNA. ROS can be formed by a variety of external agents, including ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, as well as chemical agents and viruses. These agents can cause the formation of free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can react with DNA to produce genetic alterations. Indirect DNA damage can also be caused by the formation of DNA adducts, which are chemical compounds that can bind to DNA and cause genetic alterations. These adducts can be formed by a variety of external agents, including ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, as well as chemical agents and viruses.",
    " William Adams (Master of Pembroke) (c. 1685 – 1748) was an English academic, the master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, from 1737 until his death. William Adams was born in 1685 in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, the son of Thomas Adams and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated at the Free School, Ely, and then at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1701 as a sizar, that is, a poor student who would receive financial support from the college. He was later elected a scholar, and in 1707 was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree. Two years later he gained his Master of Arts degree, and in 1713 he became a Fellow of the college. In 1737, Adams was appointed the master of Pembroke, in succession to his old friend, John Whalley. During his time as master, the college's finances improved considerably, and Adams was able to improve the college's buildings and other facilities. He also enhanced the reputation of the college by encouraging the pursuit of academic excellence. In 1745, Adams was instrumental in the foundation of the Cambridge University Press, which was to become the world's oldest printing press. The first book to be published by the press was a collection of essays by Adams's friend, Sir Roger North. Adams died in 1748 and was buried in the college chapel. A tablet in his memory was placed in the chapel by his friends and admirers, and a tradition began which has continued to this day, whereby the master of the college, on his appointment, plants a tree in the college grounds.",
    " Thomas Reid (10 December 1849 – 17 March 1912) was a Scottish Baptist pastor, journalist and editor of The Baptist newspaper from 1880 to 1904. Reid was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and was educated at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh.

He also contributed regularly to the Scottish Baptist Journal. In 1885, Reid became the pastor of the recently built Aberdeen Baptist Church, and he remained in this post until his death. The church was said to be the largest Baptist church in Scotland, and its premises became the focus of Reid's activities within the Baptist movement in Scotland. He was a strong advocate of the temperance movement, and in 1888 he took part in the foundation of the Aberdeen and North of Scotland Temperance Society. In 1898, he became the editor of the Temperance Journal, and he also contributed to the Scottish Temperance Leader. Reid was a member of the Aberdeen Public Library Committee for many years, and he was also a member of the Aberdeen Town Council from 1905 to 1908. In 1908, he was appointed to the Aberdeen Board of Education, on which he served until his death. He was also a member of the Aberdeen and North of Scotland Committee for the Pan-Anglican Congress, which was held in the city in 1908. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Reid was one of the leaders of the Baptist movement in Scotland, and he was a strong advocate of the temperance movement.

    " The Roscrea Brooch The Roscrea Brooch is a late 8th-century copper-alloy and enamel brooch from Ireland, which takes the form of a bent ring. It is highly decorated with fine enamel work, and is one of the few pieces of jewellery from the time and place to survive the Islamic invasion of Ireland in the early 9th century. It is named after the town of Roscrea, where it was found in the 19th century. The brooch is made of copper alloy, and is decorated with enamel work in a number of different colours. The general design is of a ring, bent in the centre. The ring is not perfectly round, and is made up of two half-ring parts which are not quite identical. The two half-rings are held together by a pin which passes through both of them, and then through a loose ring on the back. The pin is held in place by a catch. The brooch also has a hinge, allowing it to be folded in half for easier and safer storage. The enamel work is of the highest quality. The dominant colour is a translucent green, with yellow and blue enamel also used. The enamel work is used to decorate the brooch in a number of different ways. In some areas, it is used to create a geometric design, while in others it is used to create a cloisonsé effect. In some cases, the enamel is used to write letters of the Latin alphabet. The back of the brooch is decorated with a fleeced dog. The brooch is held in the National Museum of Ireland.",
    " Bwanga Tshimen is a traditional mancala board game played with stones or seeds in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The game is also known as Bwamanda, Kwele, or Kasapa. The name Bwanga Tshimen means \"good stones\" in Swahili. The game is usually played on a board consisting of a series of pits dug in the earth or marked out in a line on the ground. The board is typically accompanied by a cup or hook for moving the stones. The stones are usually small, smooth, and of equal size. The basic rules of Bwanga Tshimen are similar to those of other mancala games. Each player controls one end of the board, and the objective of the game is to capture all or some set of the opponent's stones by capturing them in one's own cups or pits. Each turn, a player removes all stones from one of their own pits and then \"sews\" them across the board, landing in the next pit which is either empty or contains the opponent's stones. If the stones land in an empty pit, the player's turn ends. If the stones land in a pit with the opponent's stones, the opponent's stones are captured and removed from the board, and the player's turn continues. A distinctive feature of Bwanga Tshimen is the manner in which a player's turn ends. A player may end their turn by \"bumping\" one of their own stones against the side of an opponent's pit, and capturing it together with any stones it has captured. A player may also end their turn by \"loading\" one of their own stones into an opponent's pit, which captures any stones in the pit and also ends the player's turn. A player may also end their turn by \"throwing\" one of their own stones onto an opponent's stone in the same pit, which captures the opponent's stone and ends the player's turn."
