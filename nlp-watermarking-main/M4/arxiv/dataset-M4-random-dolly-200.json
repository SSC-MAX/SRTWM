    "We study the power allocation in multi-user scenarios with delay-limited fading channels. The general case where both the number of users and the number of channel uses are more than one is considered. We propose a low-complexity water-filling-like algorithm with closed-form expressions for the per-user water levels. We show that the proposed algorithm maximizes the average sum-rate of the system under total power constraints on the users’ transmission powers. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform existing algorithms in the low-to-moderate SNR regime. VI statements, initiated by A.

    "A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies is presented. It consists of a static, non-rotating stellar component, resembling a 5 Gyr old single stellar population, which forms the host galaxy, and a compact object (black hole or neutron star) that accretes matter from the companion and produces a UV excess by emission from the accretion disk. Different model parameters can reproduce the UV color, the near-IR brightness, the UV spectral slope and the UV emission line strength of elliptical galaxies. The presented model, that combines simple assumptions and physically motivated parameters, can be a useful tool to interpret the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies.

    "In a wireless broadcast channel with multiple antennas at the transmitter and one antenna at the receiver, it is possible and beneficial to allow some of the transmitter antennas to be turned off, as long as the signal energy is spread across the antennas. This article studies the system design question of how many transmitters should be turned on, and how much transmission power should be used, to maximize the number of receivers who can recover the transmitted information at an arbitrarily low cost. We consider the case where the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI), and the case where the transmitter only has statistical CSI. In the case where perfect CSI is available at the transmitter, we determine the optimal number of active transmitters and corresponding transmission power that maximize the number of receivers who can recover the information at an arbitrarily low cost. We then characterize the scaling of the number of active transmitters and corresponding transmission power with the blocklength of the channel code, up to logarithmic factors, for the symmetric case where the channel is invariant under permutation of the antennas. When only statistical CSI is available at the transmitter, we provide sufficient conditions for low-complexity effective coding and interference management to achieve nearly-optimal performance, and we describe a specific coding and interference management scheme that achieves within a factor of 2/3rd the maximum possible number of receivers.",
    "Cool stars play an important role in the dynamics of galaxies by delivering energy and material away from the core. However, their influence extends far beyond their host galaxy, as they can also affect the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and even the galactic halo via feedback effects. Here we present new optical and ALMA observations of a peculiar cool star, named HK loops, in the metal-rich circumnuclear disk of the spiral galaxy M83. This star is located near the galactic center, only few kiloparsecs from the supermassive black hole, and is possibly growing by accretion. We report a probable ejection event of gas and the resulting broad molecular and atomic hydrogen lines, the first such detection for a cool star other than the Sun. We also detect a flow of dusty plasma from this star, which is further evidence of the complex interaction between this star and its environment. We discuss the potential implications of this discovery for our understanding of cool star feedback in extreme environments, and its connection to galaxy evolution.",
    "In this paper we consider a system of particles interacting via binary collisions and which also interact by means of a pairwise interaction potential which is degenerate in some sense. We show that the dynamics of this particle system can be approximated, in the appropriate scaling, by a coupled system of non-linear conservation laws. The approximation is in the sense of weak convergence of probability measures on appropriate function spaces. This hydrodynamic limit is then used to study the large time asymptotic behavior of the particle system. We consider the case when the interaction potential degenerate in a Kramers sense. In this case the hard-core interaction force and the inter-particle interaction force are not opposite, and they have the same scaling with the particle density. This degenerate dynamics do not satisfy the hyperbolicity condition. We show that if the initial data are regular enough and the time interval is small enough, then the particle system approach the hydrodynamic solution as time evolve. The proof is based on the theory of viscosity solutions and the compactness method.",
    "The InterHourly-Variability (IHV) Index of Geomagnetic Activity and its Use in Deriving the Long-term Variation of Solar Wind Speed. The InterHourly-variability (IHV) index of Geomagnetic Activity is introduced and its characteristics are defined. This is then used to characterize the long-term variation of Solar Wind Speed (SW speed) that has occurred over the past 450 years. The SW speed variation is shown to comprise two component parts, a primary component (periodic wave with a period of around 11 years) and a secondary component (a clear long-term increase). The IHV index is shown to track the SW speed variation very closely, with the change in SW speed driving the change in IHV index. The SW speed variation is shown to have an overall increasing trend, at a rate of around 20 km/s/century. This has important implications for Space Weather, as the increased SW speed directly influences how much energy the Solar Wind carries.",
    "We present a tight binding model to study the optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). The total electron Hamiltonian includes a uniform background electrostatic potential and a short-ranged potential arising from the confinement in the NCs that we treat within the effective-mass approximation. We numerically evaluate the optical absorption spectra and demonstrate that it accurately describes the Mie theory results in the limit of large NC size. Furthermore, we develop an analytic solution of the infinite NC size limit that can be used to efficiently evaluate the absorption spectra of small NC systems. We apply our approach to study the optical absorption in PbSe NCs and show that the observed blueshift of the absorption edge is caused by the quantum confinement and, at large wavevectors, can be well fitted by the 2D Fabry-Pérot model. We finally discuss some implications of our results for the optical studies of plasmon hybridization and screening in NCs and semiconductor interfaces.",
    "The chemical composition of the Type II Cepheids is relevant for understanding their evolution, dynamics and pulsation. For the first time, we report the abundances of thirteen chemical elements for the BL Her and W Vir variables. The Type II Cepheids are pulsating stars in the Cepheid instability strip of the H-R diagram and they are primary distance indicators. The knowledge of the chemical compositions of these variables is of great importance for further refinement of the P-L relationship based on the physical parameters derived from their spectra. It is also very useful to study their evolution and dynamics. Our abundance analysis was based on the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data. In total, 56 individual spectra of 14 BL Her variables and 7 W Vir variables were used for the analysis. We employed the elemental abundance analysis technique called the spectral differential imaging (SDI). We applied a very accurate and robust analytic method of SDI which we have developed recently. We achieved an uncertainty of 0.2 dex for chemical abundances determined from individual spectra.",
    "In this paper we develop a framework for propagating scalar fields in (Anti) de Sitter spacetimes using the concept of time ordering. We introduce the concept of a scalar propagator which describes the temporal development of a scalar field, and use this to formulate the scalar field equations of motion in terms of a time ordered correlation function. We consider the de Sitter and (Anti) de Sitter spacetimes as special cases of our more general time ordered theories, where we apply this to minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields. We explicitly solve the scalar propagator in these theories in global coordinates, and use this to find an approximation to the full propagator. Finally, we illustrate our results by computing the two-point function of a minimally coupled scalar field in various de Sitter and (Anti) de Sitter spacetimes. We show that the two-point function is given by the Hadamard self-correlation function in de Sitter, by the Wightman two-point function in (Anti) de Sitter with vanishing boundary terms, and by the boundary Wightman two-point function in de Sitter with a cosmological horizon.",
    "Conservation laws are the backbone of modern physics. In particular, the principle of conservation of energy is crucial for explaining most of the phenomena in our daily lives, from the movements of celestial bodies to the interactions between particles. In the last few decades, a powerful approach to deriving conservation laws from first principles has emerged, namely, the method of Lagrangian mechanics. In Lagrangian mechanics, the evolution of a physical system is described in terms of the positions and velocities of its particles, from which one can derive the corresponding differential equations, often known as the Euler-Lagrange equations. The solution to these equations is called an extremal, and their locus in phase space is called a critical point. The necessary conditions for a critical point to be an extremal are called the Euler-Lagrange equations. The corresponding statement in the relativistic domain is known as the principle of relativity. Lagrangian mechanics has been extremely successful, but it has some notable limitations. For example, many systems of interest do not have a Hamiltonian description, for reasons including the need to explicitly consider particle positions and velocities. Thus far, there is no general method to obtain Hamiltonian dynamics from a given Lagrangian. Also, the notion of a momentum (which serves to identify a phase space point) typically only arises in special cases. Even in the presence of symmetries, the Lagrangian is rarely known a priori and often must be determined by solving an equation. Finally, conservation laws should be independent of the choice of coordinate system, but in most Lagrangian mechanics formulations, this is not the case. These limitations have encouraged the development of a new variational method known as Lagrangian field theory. This approach was initially proposed by Victor Andreevich Volodin in the late 19th century; the first systematic treatment was given by Vladimir Igorovich Éleshev and Dmitrii Aleksandrovich Mikhailov in the 1960s. Lagrangian field theory is formally similar to Lagrangian mechanics, but the evolution is described in terms of “fields” (functions of space and time) rather than “particles.” Fields need not have an assigned location; the Euler-Lagrange equations describe the evolution of field gradients. As a result, field theory provides a framework for obtaining both Hamiltonian and relativistic dynamics from a given Lagrangian. Despite these successes, Lagrangian field theory has not gained the same level of popularity as Lagrangian mechanics. One likely reason is the apparent lack of intuitive appeal of this abstract, formal approach. Lagrangian mechanics is an engineering or geometric approach, focusing on the physical laws as implemented in equations of motion; Lagrangian field theory is more of a mathematical approach, focusing on the structure of the governing equations. Another likely reason is that Lagrangian field theory has been largely restricted to applications to classical mechanics and field theory. Over recent years, this restriction has been relaxed and the approach has been applied to relativistic field theories, fluid dynamics, the calculus of variations, and even to computer vision and reinforcement learning. The goal of this paper is to introduce",
    "Astronomers presented high-precision astrometry on the VLT/FORS1 at time scales of few days for the first time. Based on images obtained in five intermediate bands between 450 and 930 nm and collected over a baseline of 2-3 days, the proper motions of various objects were determined with precisions down to 12.8±4.9 km/s, corresponding to acceleration figures of up to 8.2 m/s2. While this result can be achieved for individual objects, the most exciting results were obtained for fields containing clusters of stars. In the old open cluster NGC 7142, a group of 22 probable cluster members was identified whose kinematics suggest they are most likely associated with the cluster. An acceleration of up to 5.2 m/s2 was determined for one of these stars, the most significant measurement of its kind to date. In addition, the proper motion of another open cluster, NGC 1976, was measured for the first time, revealing an acceleration of 1.2 m/s2. The results presented here demonstrate the capabilities of modern large telescopes to measure accelerations using astrometry in multiple bands over short time baselines and therefore have important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and their environments.",
    "KNO3 is a promising ferroelectric material that has recently been highlighted as a promising candidate for thin film technology due to its large piezoelectric coefficient, small Curie Temperature and highверactive coefficient. However, KNO3 is prone to phase separation, which obscures its ferroelectric behaviour. In this theoretical study, using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we have studied the ferroelectric phases of KNO3 and its property evolution with changes in temperature and pressure. Our results indicate that the ground state of KNO3 is ferroelectric with the polarization pointing along the c-axis. The ferroelectric switching is likely triggered by the depolarization rotation mechanism. Furthermore, our calculated elastic constants indicate that KNO3 is likely to be a soft ferroelastic with a tendency to undergo a polar state–paraelectric state transition. We hope this study can help to clarify the ferroelectric behaviour of KNO3 and bring it to the attention of thin film communities.",
    "Interstellar ices may provide the only reservoir of organics in the Galaxy, and thus their chemical compositions and structures are crucial to our understanding of how life originated on Earth. The simplest possible organic molecule, HCOOH, was recently detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) through its infrared vibration-rotation band at 3735 cm−1. Infrared spectroscopy of this band has now been performed for a series of solid HCOOH analogues, grown in an interstellar ice analog consisting of amorphous solid water deposited on a metal surface. The results provide strong evidence that the 3735 cm−1 band arises from quantum mechanical tunneling between local energy minima on an asymmetric double-well potential energy surface. This information will be of value in understanding the origin and evolution of carbon on Earth and other planets. Ice analogues of HCOOH have been grown in an interstellar ice analog consisting of amorphous solid water deposited on a metal surface. High-resolution infrared spectroscopy has been performed on the 3735 cm−1 vibration-rotation band of the HCOOH molecule. These data provide strong evidence that the 3735 cm−1 band arises from quantum mechanical tunneling between local energy minima on an asymmetric double-well potential energy surface. These results provide crucial information about the chemistry and physics of interstellar ices, which are vital to understanding how life originated on Earth.",
    "In this work we study the fragmentation of a charm quark into non-relativistic bound states of light quarks, namely, mesons, using an effective theory approach. In this theory the charm quark interacts with the quantum fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, which simulates the gluon field in the underlying gauge theory. We find that the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a charged pion can be well approximated by considering the Schrödinger equation for a simple potential model, where the coupling between quark and diquark is parametrized by an effective coupling constant. We calculate this constant using heavy quark effective theory and find that, within our truncation, it is independent of the light quarks inside the initial charm quark state. The parameter of the model which effectively measures the strength of the interaction, the effective coupling constant, is determined from the experimental pion spectrum. We also calculate the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a kaon. We compare with recent LHCb data and find a much larger effective coupling constant for the transition to a kaon compared to that for a charged pion. We discuss the implication of this finding for the possible explanation of the surprising enhancement of the number of produced K+ over that of K- at the LHC.",

In this paper, we introduce Ramsey interferometry with a two-level Tonks-Girardeau (TGO) gas and demonstrate its application to resolving high-precision energy levels of mesoscopic systems. Ramsey interferometry, first introduced in 1963, offers the advantage of precision energy level measurement through Ramsey zone shielding and Ramsey acceleration. We propose an analogous approach using a two-level TGO gas in which a sample level of precision spectroscopy can be achieved through interaction-induced reduced qubit decoherence. In particular, we demonstrate this approach through Ramsey interferometry of a two-level TGO gas, and show that the frequency of theRamseyRamsey light shift can be resolved with sub-kHz precision. Ramsey interferometry with a TGO gas offers a precision spectroscopy approach for molecular systems, quantum many-body systems, and other systems affected by qubit decoherence.",
    "Ideal hydrodynamics is a powerful tool for understanding the long-time dynamics of dissipationless kinetic energy dominated systems. While much has been learned using linearized theories, nonlinearities typically render the problem intractable. In this paper, we develop a family of exact solutions of the (inelastic) Boltzmann equation, that describes a freely cooling gas with divergent internal energy, for a general cooling law that interpolates between an elastic collisional cooling and an adiabatic expansion. We characterize the solution by an entropy density, from which we derive a closed system of equations for the density and velocity. We demonstrate that for a particular cooling law, the solution exhibits singularities in the form of Dirac deltas in both the density and velocity fields. We confirm these solutions using direct numerical simulations of the inelastic Boltzmann equation, and discuss physical implications and possible applications of these solutions to, e.g., stellar collapse and galaxy formation.",
    "In this paper, we study a special case of the quantum walk in which the probabilities of the walker stepping to the left and right are both biased by a factor of alpha in one direction. The model, referred to as a self-interacting quantum walk, may be realized in various physical systems, such as electrons on a inhomogeneous lattice. We consider a general initial condition, allowing the walker to have any fractional part, and prove that the quantum walker will settle in finite time into a pure quantum state with real eigenvalue density equal to 1. We also consider the classical analogous of this walk, where at each time step, the walker may choose to step to the left or right with some probability. While the classical walk is transient in general, we prove that for sufficiently small alpha, the classical walk will always settle into a periodic configuration. We present a numerical simulation of the time-dependent behavior of both the quantum and classical self-interacting walks. As a further application of our techniques, we prove that the quantum walk converges in distribution to the classical walk. Additionally, we study two measures of mixing time: a quantum version of the quantum return localisation, and a classical version of the Klein gas correction. Finally, we present a large deviation analysis of the classical self-interacting walk and show that the walker is most likely to end up in a finite number of cells.'",
    "Neel order in square and triangular lattice Heisenberg models was examined using the linear spin wave method. We find that in the isotropic case, the Neel order parameter has a cusp-like divergence at the ferromagnetic Heisenberg critical point in both cases. However, a subtle difference is observed in the dispersion of spin wave excitations near the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. In particular, the longitudinal spin wave velocity in the square lattice model shows a non-analyticity at the critical point, in agreement with the recent mean field result, while the corresponding result in the triangular lattice model is analytic. This behavior is discussed in the framework of the recently proposed theory of quantum renormalization group, and a comparison with experimental observations on Ca$_{2-x}$Na$_{x}$V$_2$O$_5$ is also made.

    "In this paper we explore the possibility to learn something from the distribution of the biggest fragment in an iron-rich, zirconium rich, 304 stainless steel sample, using artificial intelligence techniques. The goal is to check if the distribution of the biggest fragment – here named “vital trace” – could be used as a fingerprint to identify the origin of the sample and if it carries information about the processes by which the sample was formed. We run a supervised machine learning algorithm with three classes, namely “iron-rich”, “zirconium rich” and “304 stainless steel”, using as features the elemental concentrations of 26 elements and as target the vital trace distribution. We found that the algorithm was able to learn the differences between the classes and to generate different predictions for the three classes, with an accuracy of more than 70% when using only 10% of the samples to train the algorithm. We also applied a similar algorithm, this time using histological images of burns as input and found that it was also able to learn the difference between “304 stainless steel” and “fire” samples, even using only 3 burns to train the algorithm. This shows that vital trace distribution could carry information about the processes occurred before the formation of the material. We believe that this work is a proof of concept that the distribution of the biggest fragment, that could be easily lost during the manufacturing of a material, could carry information that could be used to identify processes occurred before the material formation.",
    "The large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe today exhibits a complex spatial distribution of galaxies, seemingly at random, with an amplitude of a few tens of millions of light-years at low redshifts. This \"cosmic web\" is a powerful cosmological tool, which, combined with other cosmological measurements, is helping to nail down the nature of dark energy. As the largest nonlinear structure in the universe, the LSS strongly depends on the combination of matter density and dark energy density. We perform a complete LSS analyses using the halo model and Liang-Mocular method in the latest cosmological simulations, including the state-of-the-art simulations (e.g.,, Auriga and Illustris) and classic simulations (e.g., Millennium and GHALO). We then use five popular parametrizations of dark energy to modify the evolution of the linear growth factor and the evolution of the rms fluctuation of the matter density field to predict the formation epochs of halos and their impacts on the shape of the galaxy power spectrum. We finally summarize the possible results in terms of projected art maps and make a summary plot. We find that the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum is able to break the degeneracy of the five dark energy models at the 0.5% accuracy level in the future survey, i.e., the Euclid and WFIRST missions.",
    "The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) is a survey conducted with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) deepening the census of the stellar mass in galaxies, from the young to the old universe. The total sample includes 980 early type galaxies and 1069 late type galaxies between redshifts 0.2 and 5, drawn from 44 independent fields (VVDS-44) in 32,000 arcmin2 of the sky uniformly distributed over three sky releases (VVDS-007, VVDS-Europe and VVDS-Omega). The VVDS-44 observations have already been presented in the single fields (hereafter SF) papers. These data are used to investigate the assembly history of galaxies by measuring the evolution with time of the scaling relations between the stellar mass, colour and environment, between 0.2<z<2.3. These are compared with local relations and with high-redshift analogues computed from mock galaxy catalogues built from hydrodynamical simulations, to infer the role of merging and of environmental processes in shaping the evolution of galaxies. The VVDS-007, VVDS-Europe and VVDS-Omega surveys cover 32, 24 and 18 % of the sky respectively. The paper describes the survey strategy, the dataset and the measurements made, as well as the analysis methods. The paper concludes with an overview of the main results and of the progress in the early data analysis of the wider VVDS-Infinity survey, which will study the evolution of galaxies as a function of their luminosity and rest-frame colour out to z = 6.",
    "The paper explores the effect of exchange frustration on the magnetic caloric effect (MCE) in the J1-J2 model on the square lattice. The J1-J2 model describes coupled layers of spin-1/2 moments, where ferromagnetic (FM) intra-layer and antiferromagnetic (AFM) inter-layer exchange constants are assumed. The MCE in this system was shown to result from both a latent heat and a magnetic field effect. The former arises from the modification of the magnetic order upon cooling through the Néel temperature T_N, whereas the latter results from an induced uniform magnetization in the non-magnetic background of thermally excited domain walls. The latter effect becomes particularly pronounced in the presence of strong frustration, as it allows the MCE to remain large even at very low temperatures. Using state-of-the-art large-scale cluster Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate this issue in the J1-J2 model on a square lattice, varying the coupling ratio J2/J1 from 0 to 1. We demonstrate that the presence of frustration has only a minor effect on the Néel temperature, T_N ∝ (J2/J1)−1, but it has a profound effect on the magnetic field effect. Although the induced uniform magnetization grows continuously from zero for T>T_{NL}, where T_{NL} is the Néel-like temperature defined by T_{NL} = (J2+J1)/2, it becomes systematically non-zero below a critical frustration value J2C ≈ 0.67 J1. We determine the scaling behavior of the MCE across the full range of J2/J1 and find that it is largely determined by the induced uniform magnetization, although a residual field-dependent latent heat remains and contributes to the total heat capacity across the entire ordered range. We extract the field- and temperature-dependent isothermal entropy change ∆S(T,H) and show that it diverges as the magnetic field approaches the saturation value B_{sat}, whereas its temperature derivative ∂∆S(T,H)/∂T decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. These findings are consistent with recent theories for the field-dependent behavior of ∆S in frustrated magnets, which predict ∆S(B)∝B−B_{sat} for fields close to B_{sat}. Our MC simulations also demonstrate the presence of thermally induced domain walls, which become more numerous with decreasing temperature and give rise to an exponential increase in the corresponding domain wall tension with decreasing temperature. As the wall energy increases with system size, ∆S(T,H) is expected to increase exponentially with system size at low temperatures. These findings are consistent with",
    "Mass-loss events in the later evolutionary stages of stars are critical for the understanding of the final fates of stars. Radial velocity curves of typical stars with radiative outer envelopes can be accurately modeled using theories of mass-loss processes. However, the processes that drive the dramatic mass-loss events observed in some supergiants are not so well understood. Of particular interest are the events that drive the rapid mass-loss exhibited by many of the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the Quasi-periodic Modulations (QPMs) of the radio signatures of several supernova explosions. Recent results on the rapid mass-loss of LBVs have greatly increased the number of known examples and provided a framework for explaining some of the more extreme events observed. In some cases, the observed mass-loss is well described by relatively simple, magnetohydrodynamically-driven stellar winds. In other cases, the mass-loss is more consistent with radiatively-driven winds. This might indicate that multiple mass-loss mechanisms are at work in these objects, or that more complex processes, such as clumping or substantial rotation, are involved. The QPMs observed in the radio signatures of several supernova explosions also continue for many years after the explosion. These modulations are usually well described by simple harmonic functions with frequencies near 0.25, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.5 cycles per year. The 0.6 cycle per year frequency has also been found to decrease with time as the supernova evolves. This seems to indicate that the process that produces the modulations has memory. In most models, this requires a binary companion or another form of internal resonance. A variety of observational and theoretical approaches have been used to study these dramatic mass-loss events. Recent modeling has benefited greatly from the theoretical advancements made in the areas of hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and nuclear reaction networks. Future work will likely benefit from the continued study of individual objects and also from coordinated monitoring programs designed to detect the onset of such rapid mass-loss.",
    "Magnetic fields are observed in a vast range of cosmic objects, from planets in our solar system to stars and galaxy clusters. These magnetic fields have different origins, either they are part of the initial conditions of the Universe (the case for the magnetic fields of planets and stars), or they are generated by a conducting fluid (galactic and cluster magnetic fields). Yet another origin of magnetic fields, common to many astrophysical systems, is related to some process that generates macroscopic turbulence. In particular, relativistic jets, that are widespread in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst (AGB and GRB) outflows, are potentially very effective emitters of macroscopically-turbulent kinetic energy. In this Letter, we report AURA data, which show that one of the AGB and GRB afterglows, the magnetic field is generated by the kinetic energy of the relativistic turbulent flow.",
    "A random walk on a countable state space is often interpreted as a Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov chain with countable state space. In this paper, we show that a random walk on an infinite-dimensional Banach space, equipped with a suitable probability measure, can be interpreted as a strong approximation of the corresponding Markov chain, yielding a convergence result in distribution. We illustrate our results with an example from financial mathematics, study the impact of the approximation error, and present several consistency results.' The analysis presented in this paper is closely related to the study of degenerate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with vanishing coupling terms, in the case where the underlying SDE is interpreted as a weak approximation of a Markov chain. We refer to the books of Kurtz [64] and Stelzer and Zheng [113] for detailed discussions and further references on the approximation theory for Markov chains. In our analysis, we consider a more general situation of an approximation of arbitrary accuracy by stochastic differential equations, exploiting recent results on the functional central limit theorem for continuous time Markov chains.",

Continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths from this source has been little studied. We have carried out new cm-wavelength continuum observations with the Very Long Baseline Array that reveal a core-jet structure for the first time. The spectrum, which is fairly flat from 80 to 6 cm, is consistent with optically thin free-free emission from a thermal electron population with a temperature of approximately 0.2 keV. The derived cm-wavelength flux density is approximately 110 mJy, which corresponds to a luminosity of L ∝ 1.2 × 10 31 W. This is slightly higher than the values estimated from lower-frequency measurements, but it is within the errors of those estimates. We speculate on the possibility that the cm-wavelength spectrum is affected by free-free absorption.",
    "We present a direct measurement of the spatial curvature of our universe combining the information from distant supernovae Ia with the local gravity environment of the Sloan Great Wall galaxy cluster. The combined data set yields a value for curvature of −0.006 ± 0.008 (1σ), corresponding to a flat universe with 96% confidence. This measurement is consistent with a curvature of 0, as expected for a universe described by general relativity with a cosmological constant. However, we also find a significant statistical correction to the measured value of the cosmological constant of ΔΛ = −0.054 ± 0.032 (1σ), corresponding to an open universe with 99.99994% confidence. This correction, which we find to be consistent with statistical fluctuations expected from measurement uncertainties, provides a robust determination of the universe's spatial curvature. The spatial curvature of our universe has significant implications for the laws of gravity. The spatial curvature is proportional to the density of matter and hence a detection of curvature rules out large-scale matter distributions required to explain the observed acceleration. We suggest that this detection, in conjunction with previous observations of an accelerating universe from supernovae and the cosmic microwave background, necessitates the introduction of novel forms of energy with negative equations of state, such as dark energy.",
    "Neutron--proton scattering is one of the fundamental interactions in the universe. The low-energy parameters of the neutron--proton interaction describing low-energy effective interactions in the scattering domain are of crucial importance for various nuclear, particle, and astrophysical phenomena. These low-energy parameters are usually determined by a comparison of the phase shifts of the partial waves of the neutron--proton scattering derived in the effective-field-theory framework with the corresponding experimental data. In this paper, a procedure for determination of the neutron--proton scattering low-energy parameters on the basis of the modern experimental data from partial-wave analyses is proposed. The suggested procedure includes the following steps. First, a database of all available phase-shift data with a fit to all the data is generated. Second, all the data are divided into four energy regions. In each of the energy regions, the parameters of the two-parameter potential model are adjusted to the phase-shift data with an error estimation. Third, the sum of the squared residuals is calculated for each data set. Fourth, the obtained sums are fitted to the functional form, and the parameters of the function are adjusted. Fifth, the procedure is applied for the four energy regions considered. The proposed procedure was applied to phase-shift data on the basis of the most up-to-date partial-wave analyses by the GWU, CSFL, and IUF groups. The performed fits gave the following values of the neutron--proton scattering low-energy parameters: {C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8} = {0.0726, -0.0748, 0.0023, -0.0032, 0.0069, -0.00028, -0.00058, 0.00004} fm-3. The reliability of the obtained results was verified by performing a root-mean-square analysis and calculating the corresponding statistical characteristics of the fitted parameters. The obtained results for the low-energy parameters are in a good agreement with the current recommendations of the Nijmegen group and the latest calculations performed within the EFT framework. The performed analysis also demonstrated that the energy regions around the K- and P-wave phase shifts provide the most accurate determination of the corresponding low-energy parameters.",
    "SNR G18.8+0.3 (G32.4+0.1) is a member of a small class of Galactic SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. In this letter, we report on new VLA 20 cm, ATCA 1.1 and 8.6 GHz, and EVN 5 and 8.4 GHz observations of G18.8+0.3. We also include X-ray data from a Chandra ACIS observation. In our new radio images, we find a compact structure, as previously seen at 8.6 GHz, but with a more complex and unusual morphology at 20 cm and at 1.1 GHz. In addition to a shell-like structure, we find a prominent central peak, a secondary peak to the south, and a filamentary structure to the southwest, most likely indicating shocked clouds or compressed magnetic fields. The secondary peak is visible only at 1.1 GHz, but not at 8.6 GHz or in the 8.4 GHz image. Comparing the radio and X-ray emission, we detect X-ray emission coincident with the peak of the secondary and filamentary radio peaks and to the southwest of the shell. We also see X-rays from hotter gas along the southeastern and southwestern edges of the shell. In addition, we see X-ray emission from the radio SNR itself. We discuss the implications of our results for the mechanisms responsible for the radio emission from G18.8+0.3, the evolution of the interaction between SNRs and molecular clouds, and the potential formation of population of mini-pcgs.'

    "Post-T Tauri stars (PTTs) are semiregular late-type stars similar to T Tauri stars. However, their evolution timescale is significantly longer, of the order of several hundred million years. PTTs are proposed to have formed via the same process as TTauri stars (TTSs), but with additional mass-loss via fast stellar winds. In recent years, infrared surveys have revealed the possible existence of circumstellar disks around PTTs, although not all PTTs show signs of these disks. In this paper we report the discovery of three PTTs with unusual circumstellar dust disks. The anomalous dust disks of PTT2, PTT4, and PTT5, have inner radii of 0.26\", 0.43\", and 0.12\" respectively, as determined from mid-infrared imaging. These radii are an order of magnitude or more smaller than those of typical dust disks around PTTs. We propose that these unusual dust disks may be caused by a planetesimal bombardment event, caused by the passage of a giant planet around the star. We investigate the detectability of such planetesimal bombardment through transmission spectral analysis, finding that PTT2 and PTT4 exhibit significant stellar metallic enhancements, while PTT5 exhibits possible stellar metallic enhancement. We discuss the possible origins of the planet, but cannot distinguish between the theories of dynamical capture, formation in situ, or migration from another system.",
    "The Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) is an infrared camera with capabilities similar to those of the Infrared Space Observatory but operating on the Spitzer Space Telescope. This camera was used to make observations of several stellarforming galaxies at 70 μm. Absolute calibration and characterization of the camera at 70 μm are presented. The accuracy of the 70 μm transfer function is quantified by observing a set of photometric standards, and uncertainties are found to be 5.3% at 30 μm brightness, 6.1% at 45 μm, 7.7% at 60 μm, and 9.3% at 90 μm. Stellar color and temperature estimates are compared to those derived from Infrared Array Camera data, and the two datasets are shown to be in excellent agreement given the expected errors from both instruments. Next, the 70 μm PSF is characterized, with the measurements indicating that the half-power resolution is 14.3 μm, the full-width at half-maximum is 23.2 μm, and the average background surface brightness within the PSF is 1013.2 MJ/sr^2. Absolute calibration is performed by observing Uranus at 70 μm and yields a flux of 357.8225 μJykpc2. Additionally, observations of the outer regions of five galaxies at 70 μm confirm that the 70 μm emission is clearly extended, with surface brightnesses of 23.2 μm−2 less than that of the background at the 50% level. Further analysis of these data indicates that the observed intensity is consistent with that of an exponential disk at 70 μm with scale lengths of ~4.2 kpc, smaller than but in good agreement with other wavelengths of observations.",
    "We present here a model for the X-ray spectrum of the type 1.9 Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. The spectrum, from 0.7 KeV to 10 kev, has been modeled as a combination of starburst and active galactic nucleus (AGN) components. In particular, the starburst component is represented by a combination of thin interstellar clouds with a range of metallicities and cloud temperatures, parameterized by a simple ionization balance. This model has been compared to the spectrum observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard the Swift satellite, and has been shown to provide an acceptable representation of the overall spectrum. The AGN component is represented by a power-law, absorbed by both the Galactic column and the toroidal structure around the central black hole. This model, along with a small contribution from starburst emission at low energies, can also provide an acceptable fit to the X-ray spectrum.",
    "In this paper we present rotational widths for 102 galaxies, measured from our opticalintegral field spectroscopic sample of spiral galaxies. We combine these widths with new optical photometryfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12, improved distances from the Surface Brightness FluctuationSpite Plate Method, and a dynamical Tully-Fisher relation to produce a comprehensive model forthe full rotation width - luminosity relationship. We find that the residuals in the rotation widthsfor a particular galaxy are strongly correlated with the surface brightness of that galaxy. This result isconfirmed by an investigation into the cause of the residuals - seeing-related errors. Using a dynamicalTully-Fisher relation which is robust against seeing-related errors, we find that the residuals in theTully-Fisher relation are entirely attributable to the surface brightness of the galaxy. Therefore, we presenta method for predicting the rotational width of a galaxy from its optical luminosity, using only redshiftand surface brightness observations. We apply this relation to an external dataset of 31 galaxies with known optical luminosities androtation widths, and find that the predicted rotational widths are on average 12.2% larger thanthe observed rotational widths. While this offset is significant, it is considerably smaller than theseeing-related errors found in the above analysis. Therefore, we conclude that our new, surfacebrightness-sensitive rotational width measures are an improvement on those presented in our previous paper. Wehope that this new version will be of use to scientists working with optical rotation widths but havingsubstantial concerns about the seeing-related errors in the published Tully-Fisher relation.'",
    "A brief abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. “Cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates” by N. G. Berloff and P. S. Julienne (2015). This paper describes a method to solve the time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) equation with a rotating potential. The paper focuses on the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation (with a non-rotating trap) but includes a brief discussion of how to extend the method to the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The method is tested on the case of a non-interacting, non-rotating BEC crossing the unit magnetization quantum trangle. This provides a good test of the method as the initial state is known exactly. The paper also discusses how to apply the method to realistic systems, which may include interacting bosons and/or a rotating trap.",
    "Recent observational campaigns have discovered a widespread, but inhomogenous, CIV galactic wind from starbursting galaxies at high redshift, identified through characteristic blueshifted CIV absorption associated with the outflowing wind. We use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the wind properties around galaxies at redshifts z = 3-5, when the typical escape velocities of z = 3-5 galaxies are of order 200 km/s. The fraction of baryons in stars of these galaxies at high-redshift is typically 80%, and thus likely progenitors of local ellipticals. We identify four primary wind signatures, which can be distinguished by detailed spectra and spatial resolved observations: a broad component from winds driven by SNe and stellar winds from aged stellar populations, a dense shell around the shocked interstellar and intergalactic medium, and gas temperature and ionization state driven winds from young massive star populations. The combined effects of these diverse wind signatures leave characteristic imprints in the CIV equivalent width and spatial profile, which can be used to distinguish galactic winds around high-redshift galaxies from other sources of CIV in the IGM.",
    "In the standard fireball model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the afterglow emission is thought to be mainly powered by the transferred shock wave ploughing through the circumburst medium (CM). In this paper, we point out that the circumstellar wind (CSW) from the GRB progenitor can also form a wind-shaped CM. The inner part of the CSW has a velocity of a few hundred km s-1, which is much higher than that of the photonuclearCompton scattering shell. As a result, the wind would sweep up the shell and form a density structure like a cocoon, while the swept-up material would cool the shock front and produce an observable X-ray afterglow. We show that this mechanism can potentially explain the extended X-ray emission observed in some afterglows. For some specific parameters of the CSW and GRB, this model can also account for the optical/IR afterglows in some GRBs, and can naturally produce the shallow decay phase in some X-ray afterglows. We conclude that the X-ray and optical/IR afterglows of some GRBs may involve a wind-shaped CM.",
    "The min-sum decoding algorithm is widely used for forward error correction (FEC) in various coding schemes, such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) and the convolutional code. Its decoding performance is very sensitive to the initial message passed in the algorithm. A good initialization is essential for the algorithm to converge, but the initialization schemes proposed in the literature are usually suboptimal. In this paper, we investigate the degree optimization and stability condition for the min-sum decoding algorithm. We first consider the block error probability of the min-sum algorithm for the binary-input memoryless channels. The error probability is found to be a sum of probabilities of error events in a region around the first nontrivial fixed point. We then find the region of interest in the probability expression, and show that the error exponent is a convex function of the channel normalized degrees. We then propose a method to calculate the channel normalized degrees by solving a system of equations, which can be used as the stability condition for the min-sum algorithm. Finally, we show through both numerical examples and explicit formula for general LDPC codes that the stability condition is almost always satisfied, and is tight for some codes.",
    "We present high frequency (43.7-111.4 GHz) linear and circular polarization observations of fifteen AGNs from the BL Lac object frame, consisting of six quasars, six BL Lacertae objects, and three galaxies. Five of the sources were observed to have correlated linear and circular polarization on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to over an hour, while no linear polarization was detected on time scales longer than a few minutes. The observed polarization variability in these sources is best explained by jet rotation occurring in a helical magnetic field, rather than by spatial variation of intrinsic polarization as in orientable AGN models, or fluctuation in magnetic field strength as in stochastic magnetic field models. These results are consistent with a magnetic field structure that is dominated by a helical component. We also present nine-epoch imaging polarimetry at 22 GHz of the core of 3C84. During each epoch, the 22 GHz core became fainter, but the linear polarization remained constant at approximately 3% linearly and 1.5% circularly. This indicates that the polarization position angle remained constant within the measurement uncertainties.",
    "We present late-time X-ray observations of the nearby Type Ibc core-collapse supernova 2018crp with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and review its observational and modeling signatures. We measure an X-ray luminosity of (4.6 ± 1.0) × 1033 erg s−1 at a Galactocentric distance of 4.4 ± 0.3 kpc, assuming the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is 50 kpc. We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region. We thus present evidence against the compact Wolf-Rayet star progenitor model for Type Ibc SN 2018crp and, in general, favor more extended, lower-velocity explosion models for these transients. Type Ibc supernovae, or hypernovae, are a rare class of explosive stellar events that are generated by core-collapse of massive stars. Their classification is based on their observed spectra, with Type Ibc supernovae showing hydrogen or helium features in their spectrum, but lacking sufficient features of a broad absorption line supernova. The recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), also known as hypernovae, have opened up new possibilities to probe their origin. Observational constraints on the location of long GRBs suggest they are associated with the deaths of very massive stars, though the details of their progenitors are not fully understood. Two long GRBs ( GRB 170729A and GRB 160821B) were observed in the local group of galaxies, and in one of these (GRB 160821B) late-time X-ray observations were also obtained. Constraints on the progenitor star and explosion geometry can be obtained from the observed properties of these transients. For a few weeks to months following the GRB explosion, the X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical emission are powered by the forward shockwave from the escaping ejecta interacting with the circumstellar medium (CSM). This emission can be used to measure the radial distance of the shockwave from the explosion center as a function of time, the so-called light curve, and to obtain the total energy of the explosion. At later times the emission is expected to become",
    "Massive stars are formed in clusters. Their massive radiative and mechanical energies profoundly influence their environment. Despite their prevalence and crucial impact, the massive star formation process, particularly in its earliest phases, is difficult to observe due to the high spatial resolution and sensitivity needed. The water masers arise only in actively forming massive stars and gas reservoir, and so provide an excellent probe of this earliest phase. Using new Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, we detect 23 new radio water masers associated with the high-mass star formation in the Nuclear Disk of the Milky Way. The distribution, velocities, and dispersion of the water masers are consistent with them tracing an inclined rotating disk. The dynamical mass of the disk is estimated to be (3.6±0.7)×10^5 M⊙, comparable to the previous upper limit of the Nuclear Disk. This, along with the coincident far-infrared and γ-ray emissions, suggests the current high-mass star formation in the Nuclear Disk is in an early stage with substantial amounts of gas and dust.",
    "Magnetic materials that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order at low temperatures are of great scientific interest. In some of these cases, “geometrical frustration” has been shown to lead to novel behavior. Sr3NiRhO6 and Sr3NiPtO6 are isostructural frustrated, antiferromagnetically interacting magnetic systems that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK. To characterize this, we have utilized magnetic neutrons scattering, which reveals a number of interesting features, including spinon Fermi surface fragmentation.

    "The Milky Way (MW) accreted tens of satellite galaxies over its lifetime, some of which may have survived to the present day. These satellites, which can have masses ranging from 10s to 1000s of times that of the MW, can leave a coherent signal in the form of the stellar halo. Until now, such a signal has not been detected. Here I present a set of N-body simulations that demonstrate that satellite galaxies with the right properties can leave such a signal even after being completely disrupted. These simulations, which include the full response of the host halo and satellite to their interactions, are shown to match the properties of the stellar halo observed today. The accretion of such galaxies can therefore explain the stellar halo of the MW, a constraint which was previously thought difficult to satisfy. This is possible because the disruption of satellite galaxies leaves both dark and stellar haloes in the MW, and this stellar halo can be detected in current data. This work highlights the utility of galaxy haloes in exoplanet detection efforts, as many of the nearest bright stars are surrounded by faint stellar haloes that should be detectable with current instrumentation.",
    "We present the third and final paper in a series studying the Homunculus on the Eta Carinae star. The Homunculus is a strong, bipolar shock-generated optical nebula encircling the stellar core and formed in a major outburst about a century ago. In the first paper, we described how previous studies had shown the Homunculus to be most clearly represented as an oblate spheroid, with a major axis of 17 – 20 and a flattening of 0.33 – 0.4. In this third paper, we investigate the dynamical structure of the Homunculus by modeling it as a rotating gas torus, i.e. a donut. The Homunculus has been known to be highly asymmetric since its discovery, with a prominent hourglass-shaped front and a wide, wavering, bipolar back. These latter two features suggest that the Homunculus has a bipolar outflow along its axis of symmetry. By modeling the Homunculus as a donut and assuming that the equator rotates much faster than the poles, we have found that such a bipolar outflow can naturally produce the hourglass shape and wavering width seen in the Homunculus. In fact, our models with fast equator rotation (approximately 250 km s-1) very closely reproduce both the Homunculus shape and wavering width. We thus conclude that the Homunculus must have a fast, bipolar outflow along the rotation axis, likely resulting from the main outburst some hundred years ago.",
    "Co-doped TiO2 films with various Co doping levels were synthesized by sol-gel process and investigated by structural, transport and magnetic measurements as a function of O2 partial pressure during deposition. The crystalline phase of the films was verified by X-ray diffraction and revealed anatase for all samples. A transport study revealed that incorporation of Co in TiO2 matrix enhances the charge transport characteristic of the films. Magnetic measurement revealed superparamagnetic behavior for samples with low doping levels and ferromagnetic ordering at higher doping levels. The results were discussed in the light of the activation energy calculation. Reducing the O2 partial pressure from high to low level during deposition leads to an increase of the activation energy which can be correlated to the change of magnetic behavior from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. * * * * * * * * Cobalt doped TiO2 thin films with various Co doping levels were deposited by sol-gel process under various O2 partial pressures. Structural, transport and magnetic measurements as a function of O2 partial pressure revealed that the formation of Co1-xToxOy solid solution is governed by the Co concentration as well as the O2 partial pressure. As Co doping level increases, the ferromagnetic ordering is observed for the films prepared under low O2 partial pressure. An increase of O2 partial pressure leads to an increase of activation energy and the change of magnetic behavior from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering can be correlated to the change of activation energy.",
    "Recently, we presented c2d Spitzer IRS spectra of disks around T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the embedded phase, also known as the T Tauri phase. In these papers, we modeled these data with a Dusty disk plus photosphere model, finding that typical TTSs have envelope mass fractions of a few percent at outer radii of a few tens of AU. In this paper, we extend the Dusty disk model to include nine additional gas-phase lines from atomic species and H_2. We find that these additional lines can significantly improve the quality of the fits. We also test whether two-layer models, with inner and outer disk radii, improve the quality of the fits. We find that for [Ne II], [Fe I], and H_2, the two-layer models do not significantly improve the quality of the fits. However, for the [Si II], [S I], [Fe II], and [Si III] lines, the two-layer models significantly improve the quality of the fits. We conclude that the gas in TTSs' disks likely has a significant component in the molecular form, e.g., H_2. This conclusion is consistent with models of planet formation, which predict that most dust will grow into larger bodies before collapsing into molecules. Finally, we note that the quality of the fits is similar in the embedded and disk phases, suggesting that the gas-phase composition does not evolve significantly during the embedded phase.",
    "In this letter, we propose a novel structure of a black hole (BH) called a plasma puddle, in which plasma is accreted into the black hole and behaves as an envelope surrounding a black hole. In contrast to traditional BH envirnment such as a event horizon and an accretion disk, the plasma puddle has a surface, through which the black hole emits no news. The plasma puddle becomes a perturbative BH as the plasma density is sufficiently large, i.e., the Schwarchild radius is less than the radius of the puddle. For pulsars, the inner region of the accretion disk can be considered as the plasma puddle. The existence of the perturbative BH can explain the fast fluctuation of the emission direction of pulsars without invoking the small scale BH embedded in the pulsar. We conclude that the plasma puddle provides a new perspective for BH physics and pulsar emission mechanism.",
    "Two colloidal glasses are prepared using polystyrene particles with different sizes. In the first sample, the particles have a size ratio of 1.1, such that they are nearly perfectly monodisperse. This sample is well-described by the bottle-brush model, a semiflexible linear polymer, below the theta temperature. In the second sample, the size ratio of the particles is 2.2, such that the degree of polydispersity is highest. This sample is best described by a cluster-catcher model, a semi-flexible branched polymer. In the first sample, the particles are attractive and well-described by the Stein model. In the second sample, the particles are repulsive and well-described by a modified Stein model that takes into account hydrodynamic interactions. The results are compared to the theoretical expectations for a Lennard-Jones system, and for a Yukawa system. The data are most consistent with a combination of a repulsive screened-Yukawa potential and an attractive Lennard-Jones potential.",
    "Floating balls that are not satellites, but co-orbit around a star are a common sight in the night sky. These co-orbitals have been observed around both normal planets and moon-like objects. The existence of co-orbital oligarchies has only recently been confirmed by numerical simulations, with no analogous explanation in planet-disk models. This raises the question of how co-orbitals are sustained, particularly in the face of strong radial diffusion. I present an analytic model of the dynamical environment around stars, in which I identify three conditions necessary for the long-term stability of co-orbitals. First, the Laplace pressure from the central star must be large enough to overwhelm disk torques, allowing co-orbital oligarchies to form and survive over time. Second, the co-orbital region must be isolated from the co-orbital exclusion region of other stars, in order to prevent stochastic ejection. Finally, the stellar density profile must be steeply decreasing with distance from the star, so that close encounters are rare and impact angles are small, allowing the satellites to remain intact. These three conditions are met in most stars, and can account for the observed co-orbital populations.",
    "Using an AdS/CFT inspired holographic quark model, we investigate the confinement/deconfinement phase transitions of heavy quarks in an AdS space with a varying radius and found that the QCD phase transition is a second order phase transition with a lambda-like critical exponent. We also found that the number of degrees of freedom of the dual strongly coupled conformal field theory increases rapidly near the phase transition, which is characteristic of a 2nd order phase transition. Furthermore, we study the properties of mesons in the deconfined phase and observe masses that are consistent with previous studies on heavy-light mesons. We hope this work can shed some new lights on holographic QCD.

    "Recent infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed the presence of warm dust around several accreting low-mass stars in the cores of star clusters. This dust, likely produced in the stellar jets, is associated with dense, optically thick disks orbiting within 0.5 au of the central stars. The disks have masses of 10−7 to 10−5 M⊕ and radii of 100 to 1000 au, similar to those of transitional disks around T Tauri stars. The Spitzer observations have found no evidence for dusty disks orbiting the brown dwarf binary 2MASS J04231426+3203266, perhaps because this system lacks a jet-driven wind or because the separation of the binary is sufficiently large to prevent disk orbital resonance. The occurrence of disks around accreting low-mass stars in star clusters but not around accreting brown dwarfs in the same star clusters suggests that disk formation is contingent on processes independent of, but not incompatible with, core accretion.",
    "Recent experimental observation of stimulated Brillouin backscattering (SBS) in plasma-based accelerators [1–3] has created considerable interest in applying this technique to inertial confinement fusion (ICF). Current kinetic-ion simulations of SBS in ICF conditions cannot replicate these reflectivities, and previous comparisons to experiments have relied on simplified models that may not fully capture the complex plasma environment. Here, we present the first global, kinetic simulation of SBS in a high-fluence, hard-sphere, electrostatic ICF plasma. For the first time, we are able to replicate both the fast-electron-beam-driven modes and the slow, spontaneous modes observed in the experiments. Furthermore, the wavevectors and frequencies of the fast modes are in good agreement with full-kinetic simulations of a two-temperature version of the fluid equations, while the slow modes are insensitive to kinetic effects, a result that we attribute to wavevector aliasing due to the discrete electron momentum grid. Inclusion of the full kinetic electron pressure term in the ion equations of motion is also shown to improve the agreement with experiments for fast-electron-driven modes, although the effect on slow modes is less clear. These results suggest that global kinetic simulations will be necessary for future comparison with SBS experiments, and we provide the first comparison of kinetic and fluid simulations for this application.",
    "Robustness to mutations is important for an organism’s survival. As a consequence, most proteins have evolved to be robust to point mutations. However, as mutations are typically accumulated under random mating and infinite population size, this protein robustness has not been demonstrated for large populations, an environment that predominates in the real world. Here, we demonstrate robustness to large population size by evolving proteins under directional selection for high DNA binding affinity and showing that these proteins also have high mutational robustness. By evolving DNA binding sites as well as binding proteins in parallel, we also demonstrate that high binding site mutational robustness is necessary but not sufficient for high binding protein robustness. We then use detailed models to show that high binding site mutational robustness arises due to selection to minimize the effects of mutations in binding site nucleotides on protein binding energy, and that this binding site robustness can propagate to the protein. This explains our experimental and simulation results. Our study highlights the critical role of large population size in protein robustness and may explain the high mutational robustness of proteins.",
    "Femtosecond laser pulses pass through anatomic resolution pinholes in a thin metallic film. They form a tightly focused beam, with a transverse intensity distribution like a cusp. This structure is designed to confine spin-polarized fermions to a one-dimensional potential. They interact via a potential that tends to make them parallel, and attract or repel them based on their relative spin. We observe that the fermions remain stable in this one-dimensional potential. They oscillate about the center of the trap, but never spread out and escape. They even display what appears to be tunneling to a region of slightly lower potential. This is in marked contrast to the behavior of non-fermi gases, which rapidly decay into an impenetrable Bose-Einstein condensate. Our results may be explained by a simple, empirical model based on the s-wave scattering length, and support recent speculations that atoms may be able to simulate models of one-dimensional condensed matter systems.",
    "We report the discovery of extreme asymmetry in the debris disk surrounding the star HD 15115. The rotation vector of the outer belt is oriented at a PA of 167° compared to 180° for the inner belt. The axis of the extreme asymmetry is tilted with respect to the axis of the planet orbit such that the midplane of the disk is aligned with the planet orbit at a PA of 25°, or 90° - 167° = 83°. This is the first detection of planet-induced warping of a debris disk and the first detection of planet-induced tilting of a circumbinary disk. The observed tilt of the midplane of the disk is 1.7°. We discuss a few plausible scenarios to explain the observations including Kozai migration of a small body toward the star, enhanced eccentric instability of large particles in the outer belt, and satellite sculpting.

    "Relativistic jets are key to the observed phenomenology of active galaxies. Such jets carry away the angular momentum of the central black hole and collimated region, and therefore must transport energy and mass efficiently to offset their loss through jets. In contrast to non-relativistic winds, relativistic jets can stabilize through entrainment of external gas; however, there are also numerous examples of collimated outflows that are unstable to global modes. This Letter presents the first-principles theory of such instabilities in the relativistic hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic regimes, and describes how the growth rates and saturated amplitudes of global modes depend on the background accretion and jet parameters. In particular, we find that the most unstable modes are local perpendicular modes and non-axisymmetric torsional ones, with the former growing faster and likely driving rapid variability. This Letter provides the theoretical foundations for interpreting the rich phenomenology of relativistic jets, and motivates intensive scrutiny of systems with the potential to destabilize via these processes.",
    "We present optical imaging spectroscopy of six galaxy clusters identified in the redshift range 0.2≤z≤0.6 from the Dark Energy Survey year 1 data. The clusters were observed as part of the KiDS (Kilo-Degree Survey) cluster survey, and the data have been reduced with the dielectron pipeline. We measure the red sequence luminosity function (RSLF) and colour distribution for each cluster, and estimate the total cluster light by scaling the individual RSLF galaxy contributions using the observed red sequence width. We fit a Schechter function to the RSLF and measure the bright end slope, α. We measure a median value of α=-1.22±0.03, with a distribution that peaks at α=-1.28. These values are consistent with previous studies in this redshift range, and suggest that luminous red galaxies dominate the cluster member population out to z=0.6.",
    "Heavy quarkonia, e.g. J/ψ, etc. due to the suppression of the strong interaction between heavy quarks, are suitable platforms for the detailed investigations of the properties of nucleons and the non-perturbative nature of the strong interaction. With the newly developed approach based on the QCD multipole expansion, in which the interactions between heavy quarks and between heavy quarks and gluons are considered via multipole expansions, the ratios of various heavy quarkonia decays can be calculated in terms of the well-known quarkonium heavy quarkonium coupling constants and the spectra of hybrids. With the calculation of the spectroscopy of hybrids, the magnetic moments and polarizabilities of hybrids can also be obtained. It is found that the calculated spectra of hybrids are in good agreement with the lattice results. Finally, by taking into account the heavy quarkonium--hybrid interactions, the decay widths of various heavy quarkonia transitions are also calculated, and the ratios agree with the experimental data well. Therefore, both the spectroscopy and strong interactions of hybrids are well determined by the new approach.",
    "Stellar multiplicity greatly impacts the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The sheer number of possible systems, however, has made observationally determining the impacts a challenge. This work utilizes the occurrence of planets around nearby stars as a function of stellar multiplicity as well as other stellar and planetary properties to elucidate the impacts of stellar duplicity. The investigation makes use of both observations from the APPLY project and archival data from Planet Hunters, as well as a novel Bayesian approach to assign parameters to validated planets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The results demonstrate that stellar multiplicity has a statistically significant impact on the occurrence of planets with radii less than twice that of the Earth, with higher-order multiples showing fewer planets than single stars. Furthermore, there is also a weak correlation between stellar multiplicity and the multiplicity of planets, with singles having the highest multiplicity. Planet size has no statistically significant impact on planet occurrence, though this may be due to a smaller sample size and the adopted planet population not being sufficiently representative of the overall occurrence rates. This work demonstrates that planets in multiple star systems are less likely to be large enough to potentially support life, which could have profound implications for planet formation and the prevalence of life in the Universe.",
    "A-type stars are defined as having spectral types A0-A9, luminosities larger than the main sequence star with the same surface temperature, and color excesses near zero. These characteristics allow A-type stars to be easily identified in observational datasets. Pulsation is one of the key characteristics of A-type stars. However, the presence of A-type stars in open clusters can make it difficult to identify pulsation, as multiple stars in the same cluster are likely to be evolved relative to their surfaces temperatures. In this study, we examined time series photometry of 122 suspected A-type stars from the BELTESS survey to search for pulsation. We used the Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm to find periodic signals in the data. We identified fourteen stars that showed evidence of pulsation, of which three are new multiperiodic delta Scuti (DSCT) stars. We identified ten pulsating B-type stars for the first time and updated the frequencies of seven known DSCT stars. We also discuss a newly identified suspect of A-type pulsation.",
    "Applicability of layered sine-Gordon models to layered superconductors: II. The case of magnetic coupling. We extend our analysis of coupled layered sine-Gordon models to the case of magnetic coupling. First, we note that, in general, a spatially varyingLondon magnetization interacts with the charge density wave order parameter in a layered superconductor. We demonstrate, through a simple 1D Ginzburg-Landau analysis, that the magnetic coupling between the two order parameters competes with their conventional charge density wave (CDW) coupling. Depending on material parameters, such a magnetic coupling may either destroy or stabilize the charge density wave order. We verify our analytical results by carrying out a complete numerical study of the two coupled SG models using a gradient energy regularization scheme. Our numerical results suggest that in some systems the magnetic coupling may even stabilize the charge density wave order. asquarters The applicability of coupled layered sine-Gordon models to layered superconductors is analyzed in [1]. Magnetic coupling between the charge density wave order parameter and spatially varying London magnetization is analyzed. Depending on material parameters this coupling may either destroy or stabilize charge density wave order. Results of numerical study of two coupled sine-Gordon models are presented. Verification of analytical results is done using gradient energy regularization.",
    "Comet Hale-Bopp was a remarkable visitor to Earth in 1996. It was visible in the morning twilight for several weeks, captured the interest of the public and press, and was the subject of a large number of studies in all wavelength regions. In this paper we present the results of our study of Hale-Bopp in the mid-infrared. We observed Hale-Bopp with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and the Copernicus Space Observatory in April, May, and June 1996. In these data we see evidence of polarized light from Hale-Bopp for the first time. Our observations suggest that Hale-Bopp was composed of numerous thin, strongly elongated grains of ice which were aligned nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane of Hale-Bopp and its parent nucleus. These results may be explained if the asymmetric ejection of material from Hale-Bopp's nucleus was the source of Hale-Bopp's rotation and orbital angular momentum. We also examine Hale-Bopp's dust coma and calculate its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID). We find that the MOID of Hale-Bopp at the time of our observations was approximately 3.2 Earth radii, a value similar to the observed coma size. We consider implications of our results for models of the formation of Hale-Bopp and its parent nucleus and for future cometary missions.",
    "This paper investigates the networked dynamic behavior of interconnected systems. For this purpose, based on the passivity theory, a sufficient condition for stability of interconnected systems is presented in terms of a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI). Unlike the existing results, the considered system is composed of interconnected subsystems, and the subsystem input includes control input and input from other subsystems. Due to the coupling between the subsystems, the presented stability criterion can be applied to the interconnected systems with delays and component mismatches. Several examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed results. In a networked system, multiple subsystems are often interrelated. For example, in a biological network, each biological process is influenced by other biological processes. Therefore, a desirable stability criterion for a networked system should consider the effect of network connections on stability of the subsystems. The stability criteria presented in this paper allow us to consider such coupling effects.",
    "Interactions between planetesimals leads to the formation of groups and chains. This process is known as gravitational instability. It has been observed in molecular clouds and it is thought to be important for planet formation. Planet formation by this mechanism has been studied in detail. However, it has not yet been observed in stars. This is likely due to the difficulty of detecting planetesimals in protoplanetary disks, which are much more distant. I describe a new technique that can detect these objects with the help of a recently discovered instability in disks. The instability creates clumps of material that drift toward each other, increasing in density until they become unstable and form planetesimals. This has the potential to explain the extremely high density of planetesimals in the asteroid and Kuiper belts. I present simulations of the growth of planetesimals from planetesimal clumps that demonstrate this process. This work was done in collaboration with Zhongjie Gan (University of Arizona) and Jonathan J. Fortney (Harvard University).",
    "The cluster Blanco 1, in the direction of the Chamaeleon star-forming region at a distance of 120-150 pc, was identified by Béjar et al. (2004) as a young open cluster with an estimated age of about 10-30 million years. The masses of its low-mass members have not been directly measured. In this work we estimate the masses of the 10-3 Mjup substellar members with the combination of adaptive optics imaging in the infrared and high-precision radial velocities. We derive a lower mass function of n(m) ~ m^ - 1.5, with a median value of 0.088 Mjup, i.e., 7% of the cluster mass. This is the deepest exploration to date of the substellar regime in a young cluster. The cluster Blanco 1 contains low-mass members from 30 Mjup down to the substellar domain, with a median value of 0.088 Mjup. The lower mass function is n(m) ~ m^ - 1.5.",
    "GRB051022 was an unusually long gamma-ray burst (γ-ray burst, GRB), lasting for at least 27sec. It was detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on October 22, 2005, at 04:56:48.6 UT, at a nominal distance of 220 million light-years from Earth. While GRB durations fall into several distinct categories, this long-duration, or long burst, exceeds most widely accepted classification definitions by several orders of magnitude. In particular, it is more than 10 times as long as the second longest GRB, and many times longer than any other observed short/medium GRB. This extremely long duration could not be readily explained by standard models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which associate these events with the core collapse of massive stars or the coalescence of compact objects. However, current GRB models cannot fully explain the very long, as well as shorter, bursts. Alternatively, the long duration of this event could be explained by a highly beamed emission, with the consequent high chance of being observed by a space-based observer at large distance. In this case, the burst would have produced significantly lower levels of prompt high-energy emission, as observed. However, the early-time optical and X-ray afterglows that would be expected in this case are not observed. GRB051022 emitted more than 10 times more energy than the typical long burst. The most likely explanation for this extreme luminosity is beaming: the gamma-rays were beamed into our direction from a highly misaligned beam. We can place limits on the beam-opening angle of the gamma-ray beam using these limits on the optical and X-ray afterglow. Fermi's observations of GRB051022 provided the first broadband spectrum of a gamma-ray burst, from more than 10% of the total gamma-ray energy detected by the Burst Alert Telescope all the way down to the Stefan–Boltzmann limit of infrared observation with the GEMS. The detection of optical and infrared emission in this case, despite the gamma-rays being beamed away from the observer, implies that the energy emitted in gamma-rays was less than 1% of the total. Thus the highest energy observed gamma-rays were not as narrowly beamed as previously thought, allowing for a wider range of possible sources. The prompt emission of GRB051022 lasted 27 seconds, which is the longest of any gamma-ray burst ever recorded. This event was notable not only for its extreme duration, but also for its proximity to Earth. It was the nearest GRB ever recorded, and the faintest optical and X-ray afterglow ever recorded. The prompt emission of GRB051022 exhibited the usual four canonical waveforms commonly seen in GRB light curves. It",
    "Massive galaxies at 2<z<2.5 are observed to have distinct MZR with elevated stellar mass and bulge mass surface densities (Sérsic index n > 4.5). We present the results of a uniform multiwavelength analysis of 14 such galaxies and find that this elevated mass structure is accompanied by elevated star formation rates (SFR>100M⊙yr-1), low concentrations (Congo et al. 2013), and high sSFR (Gargiulo et al. 2015). With high significance, elevated dynamical mass estimates and lensing signals imply massive black holes (MBH) in excess of 10^{9} M⊙, with the majority (11/14) having MBH ~10^{8.7}-10^{9.3} M⊙. Five of these massive galaxies have Spitzer/SWIRE MIPS 24μm detections, all are detected in the hard X-ray band with (0.5-2)keV luminosities ~10^{43}-10^{44} erg s−1, and eleven are Compton-thick in the hard X-ray. These observations strongly imply that the majority of these massive, rapidly growing galaxies have central massive black holes with masses at or above the regime of \"monster\" black holes. We combine our dynamical estimates with archival VLT and ALMA data to study the cold gas and far-infrared fine structure line energetics. Most (9/11) of these systems have signifcantly elevated CO SLEDs and high estimated He 2-10 radiated powers, with estimated starburst masses MSB ~10^{10.6}-10^{11.2} M⊙. There are three broad approaches to growing such massive bulges and central black holes in the peak epoch of star formation. In the \"top-down\" or mergersill scenario, the majority of these massive galaxies are the product of mergers over several hundred million years. The second is \"in-place\" or \"normal\" growth whereby these systems are growing through concurrent, normal, secular processes like gas accretion and star formation. The third is that these galaxies are growing entirely through gas accretion. Using rough constraints on the cold gas fueling rate and Eddington limit at the heart of the \"maintenance mode\" accretion growth, we show that these monster growth events likely require significant growth fueled by gas accretion. We combine this with Bayesian growth tracks for matching black hole and bulge masses, and find that over half (7/14) of these galaxies have double-mass milestones at z~2.3-2.6, concurrent with both the epoch of peak star formation and 24μm Spitzer/SWIRE detection. By z=0, 9/14 have stellar masses ~M∗>10^{12.6}M⊙, bulge masses Mbulge>10^{11.2}M⊙,",
    "A study of the incidence of C IV absorbers along the sightlines to z ≥ 0.47 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) indicates a high degree of clustering of C IV systems near the line of sight. Six of eleven gamma-ray bursts have more than one C IV system within 60,000 km s-1 of the line of sight. The nearest two C IV systems are separated by 45,000 km s-1 on average and no more than 5,000 km s-1 without multiple C IV systems within 60,000 km s-1 of the line of sight. The most likely explanation for the high incidence of C IV absorption along these lines of sight is that a population of dark collapsed structures is passing through our line of sight. We estimate the total matter in these structures is on the order of 1022 -1023 solar masses. The dimensions of these structures are approximately 10-4 to 10-5 parsecs, which is approximately one ten-thousandth to one one-thousandth the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The clustering and relative proximity of the C IV systems indicates that these dark collapsed structures likely have typical distances of 10 parsecs from the sites of gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the inferred dimensions of these structures are consistent with the size distribution of black holes that may form from the collapse of massive primordial structures such as carbon clusters, large moons, or galaxies. If confirmed, this discovery has profound implications for modeling the demographics of black holes, their interactions with their environments, and the reprocessing of electromagnetic radiation in their broad-line regions.",
    "In this work, the effects of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds are examined. In particular, the effects of weak turbulent diffusion on the radiative transfer and chemical enrichment of carbon and silicon are considered. Turbulent diffusion acts to spread material over larger spatial scales and, in the case of carbon, enhance its overall rate of depletion relative to the case without diffusion. Thus, while the total amount of carbon remains unchanged, turbulent diffusion increases the temporal contrast of carbon abundances within a cloud, thus accelerating its chemical evolution. Carbon depletion by catalyzed reactions is also accelerated due to the increasing spatial contrast of carbon abundances. Silicon is substantially less impacted by turbulent diffusion. Both the neutral and ion silicon abundances increase with time, but the increase is less than that of carbon. Overall, the presence of weak turbulent diffusion may have an appreciable impact on the chemical enrichment of carbon and silicon within a diffuse molecular cloud.",
    "In this paper the longitudinal impedance of an XFEL undulator is calculated for operation in current-enhanced SASE (Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission) schemes. The undulator radiation impedance is derived from the wake fields and is used to study the reflections from the input ZLWstairs filter for several current-enhanced SASE setups. The performance of the setup based on seven cells of [1] is discussed in detail. It is shown that more than 90% of the input power can be reflected with only 10% loss, which is considered very good for a proof-of-principle study. The presented results show that the presented setup is very promising for reaching the originally proposed performance target of current-enhanced SASE mode at XFEL.

    "A differentially rotating force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator is studied. We derive an analytical solution in split-monopole approximation, which can be used for construction idealized models of the magnetosphere. The solution depends on two parameters, which can be chosen to approximate the geometry of the magnetosphere and the flux functions in the polar regions. We demonstrate how the solution can be used for construction models of the magnetosphere with different properties. In particular, the surface magnetic field is chosen so that the solutions can produce magnetars and gamma-ray burst jets. Magnetic fields and plasma in magnetospheres of rotating neutron stars are usually considered to be force-free. However, force-free magnetospheres were found only in special cases, for example when the neutron star has a very strong magnetic field or when the star is not rotating. In contrast, general rotating magnetospheres are described by the induction equation, which allows for electric currents and moving charges. The force-free and induction magnetic field models describe the same magnetic fields in different regimes and can be connected by their perturbative departures. We study analytically a general differentially rotating force-free magnetosphere with general equations of state and current distribution. We solve these general equations in the split-monopole approximation. This solution can be used for construction idealized models of the magnetosphere. The solution depends on two parameters, which can be chosen to approximate the geometry of the magnetosphere and the flux functions in the polar regions. We demonstrate how the solution can be used for construction models of the magnetosphere with different properties. In particular, the surface magnetic field can have different geometries (poloidal and toroidal) and can be time dependent. Such magnetospheres can produce magnetars with huge magnetic fields (about 10^14-10^15 G) and gamma-ray burst jets with observed fast rotating electrons.",
    "In this paper we introduce a method for constructing Einstein manifolds of any desired signature (2m+1,1), admitting a space of twistor lines of any prescribed flag type. These twistor spaces are constructed as moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with given asymptotics, in some simply-connected Riemann surface with complex structure deformed by a holomorphic differential. This deformation complexifies the structure group of the tangent bundle, reducing it from the special orthogonal group SO(2m+1,1) to the isometry group of the corresponding Einstein metric. The moduli spaces of holomorphic curves considered here are related to the generalized Krichever construction of Einstein metrics. We classify all the obtained Einstein structures when the Riemann surface is the complex plane or the sphere. As an application, we present explicit Einstein metrics on some of the orbifolds of the standard sphere S^{2m+1}/Ω, where Ω is a fixed point free symmetry of the underlying Fefferman-Graham ansatz for the anti-de Sitter metric.",
    "The very existence of luminous quasars (QSOs) at high redshift is difficult to explain within the paradigm of pure cold dark matter cosmology. As the most massive dark matter halos at high redshift, QSOs are good laboratories to test evolutionary models of the universe, as well as the supermassive black hole - host galaxy co-evolution. Using a sample of 12 luminous high-redshift QSOs with X-shave archived, we investigate the host galaxy dust covering factor (defined as the ratio of solid angle covered by dust to the total solid angle), and the silicate strength and colour of the mid-infrared emission, which are potential probes of the star formation rate (SFR). We find that compared to local luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs), high-redshift luminous QSOs have a significantly higher covering factor of dust, lower silicate strength, and redder infrared colour. The high covering factors suggest that these QSOs have significant on-going or recent star formation. The trends are consistent with that expected from an evolving dust-to-stars ratio, with a dust covering factor of 0.4-0.6 at z = 2.2-3.4 (where z is the cosmological redshift). There is no strong evidence for a higher proportion of IR-luminous, or active galaxies in the QSOs than typical for the bright sub-population at these redshifts, in agreement with previous studies. The observed dust and silicate properties are, however, more similar to those of local sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) than normal ULIRGs, suggesting the QSOs may evolve into SMGs at lower redshift. We discuss several scenarios to explain our results, including QSO-driven winds clearing out interstellar medium (ISM) and/or molecular clouds. However, we note that without measurement of the velocities and densities of the obscuring material, and the strength and shape of the quasar continuum, it is difficult to distinguish between these scenarios and to test the influence of the QSO on the host galaxies evolution.",
    "We present the first three-dimensional X-ray cluster correlation function based on a flux-limited sample of X-ray selected galaxy clusters from the ROSAT North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) survey. The cluster sample is drawn from the compilation of Gregor et al. (2007) and covers a volume-limited, flux range of 2-5×10^-15 W m−2 in the 0.5-2.0 keV band. The resulting 3D cluster correlation function, measured in the plane of the sky, shows no indication of the usually observed decrement towards small separation, for separations up to 20 arcmin. The 3D clustering amplitude is determined to be A = 0.436 ∓ 0.058 = 0.3064 ∓ 0.0852, where the 95 % error interval is determined from 22 bootstrap resamples. This is in excellent agreement with previous results from 2D analyses of this cluster sample. The corresponding projected correlation length is r0 = 8.25 ∓ 0.61 h Mpc, where the 95 % confidence interval is determined from 20 bootstrap resamples. This is larger than the expected strength of the correlation function for a random distribution, suggesting that the X-ray selected galaxy clusters are biased with respect to the underlying mass distribution. The 3D redshift-space cluster correlation function, r(s), is determined up to separations of 40 arcmin, yielding z0 = 0.547 ∓ 0.046, where the 95 % error interval is determined from 22 bootstrap resamples.",
    "The thermal Casimir force is attracting much attention as a medium-range interaction in nanotechnology. Recently, an analytic approach to the thermal Casimir force between metal and dielectric was proposed. The method is based on the use of the so-called dielectric permittivity spectral functions, which are measurable in the time domain. A plasma model was used for modeling the dispersive metal. It was shown that the thermal Casimir force is given by the derivative of the free energy with respect to the distance between the surfaces. The general expression for the thermal Casimir free energy was obtained. This expression was used for calculating the thermal Casimir force for various combinations of metal and dielectric parameters. It was demonstrated that the thermal Casimir force is strongly modified by dispersion of the metal. The most notable example is a change in the sign of the thermal Casimir force for a metal and a dielectric at certain combination of the parameters of these two objects",
    "Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are often formed from material torn from other galaxies in high-velocity interactions. TDGs provide a powerful test of gravity in the high-dispersion regime, as they form at high velocity where gravity is weak. MOND does not provide such a strong test, and the disagreement with observations may suggest that MOND does not describe gravitational force in the low-acceleration regime. Consequently, modification of MOND is an interesting possibility that could resolve the disagreement between MOND and observations of tidal TDGs. We present N-body simulations showing that modifications to MOND that introduce a mass dependent acceleration scale, g0(r) ~ r-a0, where a0 is a constant, can successfully describe the dynamics of TDGs. The corresponding interpolating function, fs(R) = (a0/r)2, provides a good fit to the rotation curves of dark matter halos, suggesting it may also arise naturally from modification of MOND. We apply this interpolating function to TDGs and show that it reproduces the correct scaling of the internal dynamics of TDGs with galaxy mass, rotational velocity, and orbit orientation, without a dependence on a0. These results suggest that the observed discrepancy between MOND and tidal TDG dynamics may be explained by modifications to MOND that interpolate between thestrong and weak gravity regimes.",
    "We present an atlas of circumnuclear regions of 75 nearby Seyfert galaxies observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These galaxies, which span a range in Hubble type, are among the most extensively observed Seyferts with HST. Using an unified model of active galactic nucleus (AGN) structure in which the central engine is surrounded by an accretion disk, Broad Line Region, and torus, we investigate the properties of the circumnuclear regions in these galaxies. We find evidence for spatially resolved warm absorption in the near-UV in 57% of the sample. The warm absorbers are characterized by a multi-phase structure with Doppler parameters ranging from ∼30 to ∼250 km s-1, turbulent velocities from ~10 to ~250 km s-1, and covering factors from a few percent to nearly 100%. The amount of soft X-ray flux absorbed by the warm absorber is strongly correlated with the amount of high-ionization [O VI] absorption, suggesting that the same gas is responsible for both absorptions. The multi-phase nature of the absorbing gas implies that it is composed of numerous clouds with small, non-uniform covering factors. We estimate the total column densities of individual species from the model fits and find that O VI, N V, and C IV are often the dominant ions, while gas-phase oxygen may be depleted with respect to solar abundances. We also find evidence for dust in the form of narrow absorption lines in 56% of the sample. We compare our results to recent models of dusty AGN winds, finding that the observed properties of the warm absorbers can be reproduced using obscuring columns of a few times 1022 cm-2 and velocities of a few thousand km s-1. Our sample provides the best currently available view of the circumnuclear regions of AGN and the first such atlas of its kind in the near-UV. This atlas demonstrates the feasibility of using the HST ACS to study circumnuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies in the near-UV. We find that the properties of the absorbing gas phase are generally consistent with the models of dusty AGN winds.",
    "The Casimir force is a long-range force arising from fluctuations in the quantum electromagnetic field that is caused by the boundary conditions. The Casimir force is important in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and has been applied in nanotechnology to manipulate and stabilize nanomechanical systems. The origin of the Casimir force is the excitation of electromagnetic modes between the closely spaced boundaries. Therefore, changing the boundary conditions by the varying optical properties would change the Casimir force. In this work, the experimental approaches are demonstrated to change the Casimir force through the varying optical properties. Experimentally, the force is measured by using an atomic force microscope setup with a sphere and a plate as sample bodies. The sphere is composed of two layers of different materials and the plate is covered with distributed Bragg reflectors with different grating periods. The experimental data are compared with theoretical predictions and good agreements are obtained. Therefore, the experimental approaches presented in this work are feasible for varying the Casimir force by the varying optical properties and could be useful in the Casimir and many other applications.",
    "A plasma is a very dilute collection of charged particles. The individual particles have no charge or only a very small charge, but due to Coulomb's law they can exert a force on each other. When a plasma moves with respect to a neutral, non-conducting background, the particles will experience a force in the direction of motion, called drifts. In this paper, we consider a scenario where a positively charged particle is moving towards a stationary plasma sheet. It will approach the plasma sheet and experience a negatively charged field. This field will cause the particle to move in the direction of the positive field. Before the particle can reach the plasma sheet, it will encounter a region of null field, the so-called plasmabal, in which the particle experience no force. In this region, the particles will bounce back and forth, and the motion is unstable. The particle will execute an oscillatory motion, called bounceCTL.",
    "The supergravity (SUGRA) models, in which the soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters are expressed as functions of only a few universal parameters, have been very popular since the early days of supersymmetry (SUSY). These models predict a specific correlation between some of the SUSY parameters, namely the masses of the Higgs bosons and superpartners, which could be tested at the Tevatron and the LHC. We point out that the current data on the masses of the superpartners, namely the lightest neutralino and the gravitino, can be accommodated in the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) with non-zero trilinear SUSY breaking couplings (A terms). Depending on the value of the A terms, LHC may or may not see signals associated with these interactions. In the region where LHC sees signals, the signatures are very similar to the signals expected at the Tevatron, which has currently the best sensitivity for these signals. We emphasize that this correlation is a consequence of the SUSY models and would not hold in the standard model (SM) with arbitrary SUSY breaking terms.",
    "A compelling aspect of theories with gravity is their ability to give a complete description of the universe, from the largest-scales to the smallest. String Theory, for example, or M-Theory, are compelling frameworks for such a description, unifying all the interactions of particle physics into a single, complete, elegant theory. One such aspect, not yet fully realized, is the unification of the fundamental forces: the Strong and Weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Supersymmetry, realized a quarter century prior to the unification of these forces, predicts that for every symmetry that preserves one force, there is another force, requiring a symmetry-conjugate, but slightly different, force. The manifestation of this in the real world is the hierarchical structure of the force-couplings: the Strong and Weak nuclear forces are tied together, and the Electromagnetic force is tied to the Weak force via the photon, which is itself an interaction of the electromagnetic force. The realization of unifying the three forces is a primary aspiration of high-energy physics, one that has yet to be realized. The challenge of realizing this, however, is one of engineering, for no current theory realizes this unification. While String Theory - which at its core is a quantum-mechanical theory of extended objects in a 10-dimensional manifold - offers a framework in which to realize this unification, it is a highly abstract framework, with no realization in terms of local quantum field theories. While the challenges of realizing this dream of physics have driven theoretical endeavour for nearly 70 years, a realization in terms of a local quantum field theory is yet to come. The latest, and most promising, framework for realizing this dream is that of M-Theory, unifying all of the physical interactions via the existence of 11-dimensional membranes. Unfortunately, these membranes, while realizing the dream of unification, also run into the same roadblock - no realization of M-Theory in terms of local quantum field theories. While this is a challenge that many believeString Theory to be, it is one that M-Theory does not address, leaving a major gap in the unification of the three known forces. One possible solution to this unification challenge is that of the graviton, the quantum of the gravitational interaction. If realized, this unification of the forces would be a profound achievement, and could open up the discovery of a new universe of phenomena and insights, offering a new way for theorists to understand our world. The realization of unifying the three forces is a primary aspiration of high-energy physics, one that has yet to be realized.

    "A boundary element method (BEM) solution of the two-dimensional Laplace’s equation in the half-plane using triangular elements is presented. Boundary conditions are applied on a part of the boundary of the half-plane. The BEM linear system is singular, which is typical for BEMs, because a Green’s function is used for representing the solution at the interior points of the domain. The BEM matrix is non-symmetric, and the use of a proper preconditioning method is required for achieving a good numerical accuracy. We propose a new technique for building the preconditioner which requires the solution of a local Helmholtz problem with a non-symmetric operator in the variational formula. We show that the proposed method provides a high accuracy solution, and that the numerical error is nearly exact, in the sense that the difference between the exact solution and the numerical solution is limited to the discretization error. The method works well even for very fine meshes with thousands of triangles. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by several numerical examples.",
    "A robust developmental program is essential for multicellular organisms to carry out their functions, such as formation of body plans and limbs, and to adapt to environmental change. Here we develop a theoretical and experimental framework to investigate multicellular developmental robustness, based on an epigenetic model for gene regulation. The model encompasses, for the first time, the role of cell division in developmental robustness, and our theory and experiments reveal that developmental robustness can arise from a compromise between developmental tempo and program, and between robustness to variability in cell type composition. Using this framework, we identify non-mutually exclusive avenues to improve developmental robustness. For example, increases in developmental tempo can enhance robustness; and alternative strategies to increase robustness may be to (i) reduce the influence of noise in gene expression, or (ii) reduce heterogeneity in cell composition. These results establish a theoretical foundation for multicellular developmental robustness, and we propose that our theory should enable further identification and implementation of strategies to improve robustness in synthetic systems and in regenerative medicine.",
    "Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are ubiquitous in globular clusters (GCs), yet their influence on the dynamics of cluster stars is not well constrained. Here we show that the presence of an intermediate-mass BH in a GC modifies the equilibrium structure of the cluster, with an overall expansion of the stellar distribution. In contrast with earlier studies, we show that the presence of a black hole hardly alters the structural properties of young GCs, and is only significant for older clusters. We perform N-body simulations with varied particle numbers and show that our findings are consistent with the presence of a central intermediate-mass black hole, of a mass above ~20% of the total cluster mass, having been formed via runaway mergers of individual stars and stellar remnants. This implies that BHs of high masses could have formed in GCs via processes occurring at low efficiencies during their early dynamical evolution. This provides a novel means for the formation of massive stellar-mass BHs, and may help to resolve an apparent contradiction between observations of stellar-mass BHs and the predictions of standard GC evolution.",
    "This paper investigates the second-order optimality of electrical impedance tomography (EIT). For the standard elliptic EIT inverse problem, a state that has minimal energy relative to the specified electrical boundary conditions does not necessarily have a corresponding physical shape. This phenomenon is often referred to as impedance artifacts. It has been shown that this problem can be cast as a constrained second-order minimization, subject to the incompressibility constraint and a globalization condition. In this work, we present a unified first- and second-order approach to shape optimization for EIT. We show that the associated energy functional is of second order in the deviation of the current state from an optimizer. We apply a convex relaxation to the second-order shape derivative in order to characterize the second-order shape derivative by means of the Dirichlet energy, and thereby reduce the analysis to the level of convex analysis. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theory.",
    "Strain localization in a shear transformation zone (STZ) model for amorphous solids is examined. In this model, the amorphous solid is composed of particles interacting via a short-range, repulsive core and a long-range, attractive tail in a potential that is sheared, below the glass transition temperature, Tg, to generate an amorphous solid. In quasistatic deformation, regions of high shear stress,τ(shear), form from localized regions of high strain, e(loc), which propagate as wave fronts described by a strain localization theory. Specifically, a transition from spatially extended to localized strain is observed as the ratio of the localization length, λ, to the initial system length, L0, increases. An analytical theory describing the spatial, temporal, and frequency dependent shear modulus, G(τ,ω), and its relation to the shear stress and strain waveforms is developed, which allows for analysis of the frequency dependence of localized shear stress and strain, τ(loc)(ω) and e(loc)(ω). τ(loc) is observed to have three distinct regions with decay characteristic of critical exponents in scale-free space, increasing with frequency as 1/τ(loc)∼ω^{νz}, where ν=0.5 is the divergence of the correlation length, and α and β, which depend on details of the decay of the potential, describe the frequency dependence of the critical strain amplitude required to induce strain localization. e(loc) exhibits similar critical exponents to τ(loc) except with different critical amplitude exponents α=νz=1/2 and β=1/2. Furthermore, the critical exponents and scaling laws are compared to those of supercooled liquids (in which this model was originally proposed to explain) and those of amorphous solids with a different potential, demonstrating consistency between the predictions of the STZ model and these observations. These results show that the strain localization theory for amorphous solids, derived from a theory for supercooled liquids, can provide a framework for understanding the mechanical response of amorphous solids across various different model systems.",
    "A long-standing controversy in X-ray astronomy is whether high energy (HE; 100-300 keV) X-rays are generated by the magnetic threads that connect the neutron stars (NSs) in neutron star binaries or by an accretion disk around a black hole (BH). Recently, absorption-like features at ~60-300 keV in a few magnetar candidates, including Mkr 841, were reported and attributed to either a cut-off power-law (CPL) or cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSFs), depending on the spectral analysis method used. The feature at 100-300 keV in Mkr 841 can be modeled equally well by a CPL or a CRSF. However, both the CPL and CRSF models are acceptable with large reduced χ2 values, 1.8 and 3.2 for the CPL and CRSF models, respectively. To better understand the spectral complexity of Mkr 841, we reanalyze the publicly available NuSTAR and *-Newton data using different methods. We confirm the CPL model with an exponential cut-off at ~120-180 keV, but not the CRSF model, in Mkr 841. The sharp cut-off at ~120-180 keV is well represented by a pure absorption model. Furthermore, we detect a broad band X-ray continuum extending to at least 50 keV. The phenomenological model consisting of an attenuated CPL and an absorption model successfully accounts for the broad band X-ray continuum, which likely originates from electron scattering in the magnetosphere or in the vicinity of the NS. The broad band X-ray spectrum can also be interpreted as a NS wind. These findings indicate that the magnetar scenario is a more reasonable interpretation for Mkr 841 than a black hole scenario. Mkr 841 is known as a highly magnetized neutron star with the surface magnetic field of approximately 4.8∼8.3 × 10^{13} G, the highest magnetar surface magnetic field known. It has a spin period of 2.0378 s and a fast-down jump of the period between 2010 and 2016, which is among the fastest observed in magnetars. Several absorption-like features have been reported in Mkr 841 at ~60-300 keV, including a absorption line at ~93.3 keV reported by INTEGRAL in 2004, an absorption edge at ~130 keV reported by Swift in 2010, and an absorption feature at ~60-300 keV reported by NuSTAR and *-Newton. However, the spectral complexity of Mkr 841 has not been fully understood until now. To study the NS matter environment of Mkr 841, we analyzed the publicly available NuSTAR and *-Newton data. We found that the phenomenological model consisting of an attenuated CPL and an absorption model can fit the broad band X-ray spectrum of Mkr 841 equally well, which likely originates from electron scattering in the magnetosphere or in the vicinity of the NS.

    "A chain-boson model is proposed to explain the decoherence and relaxation of a few coupled SQUIDs in a phonon bath. The model contains a set of oscillators coupled to the low-lying modes of the environments, which are modeled by an harmonic chain. It is found that the phonon bath induced decoherence and relaxation can be effectively described by a pure decay process, whose rate is determined by the spectral density of the bath and the dimensionless coupling constants between the central system and the bath. In particular, when the dimensionless coupling constants are small, the dynamics of the system can be approximately described by a Lindblad equation, from which the energy relaxation and decoherence of the coupled SQUIDs can be understood. The theory can be applied to study the decoherence and relaxation in other hybrid systems consisting of a few coupled quantum systems and harmonic chains. This model can also be used to study the quantum effects of a coupled SQUID system immersed in a bosonic bath. The quantum dynamics of the coupled SQUID system can be solved by numerically diagonalizing the corresponding Hamiltonian in a truncated Fock space. As an example, we study a phase qubit (the coupled SQUID system) in a linearly coupled chain, which is capable of simulating two-dimensional correlated dynamics. Numerical simulation results show that, when the chain length is even and the applied magnetic flux in the qubit loop is close to a half-flux quantum, two-dimensional quantum chaos takes place. The quantum entanglement between the two coupled SQUIDs increases with the number of qubits in the bath, and displays a behavior of wave nature with the increase of bath dimensionality.",
    "I present a new analysis of the proper motions and radial velocities of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. This sample, obtained from the Spectroscopic Properties of Nearby F and G Dwarfs (SPONGES) survey, is restricted to stars with 7.5 kpc < rho < 22.5 kpc and |z| < 1 kpc and a color, (G* - r* - r), that places them between 1.5 and 3.5 mag below the main sequence. By statistically comparing the heliocentric radial velocities to their respective absolute visual magnitudes, I infer the full 3D kinematics of this sample. In agreement with previous analyses, I find that the tangential velocity, Vt, increases with median Galactocentric radius, Rv. I additionally find that Vt and Rv are correlated at a significance of 4.2σ, meaning the velocity field of F and G dwarfs cannot be explained by a simple Galactocentric radial dependence. I attribute this velocity covariance to the complex evolution of the Milky Way, which likely included a early fast migration period and subsequent accretion of satellite galaxies. I also analyze the individual proper motions and do not find evidence of a kinematically anomalous population. This work shows that a broad sample of local F and G dwarfs can be used to study the 3D kinematics of the Milky Way as a function of age and provides valuable constraints for simulations of the Milky Way’s formation and evolution.",
    "In this paper we study random antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains in a transverse field using the iDMRG algorithm. We calculate the correlation function amplitude and the entanglement entropy using CFT techniques, and compare the results with iDMRG numerical simulations. We find that the CFT predictions match the numerical results very well for system sizes accessible with iDMRG. Moreover, we argue that the numerical results are consistent with a conformal field theory description of the vicinity of the large spin limit, where the spin chain can be thought as a large number of decoupled one-dimensional segments. In particular, our CFT analysis allows us to compute the conformal blocks decomposition of the correlation function amplitude, that in turn permits to explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy. We find that the leading term in the entanglement entropy is linear in the subsystem size, in contrast to the logarithmic law expected from conformal field theory in one dimension. Finally, we perform a finite size scaling of the entanglement entropy, finding that the leading coefficient is independent on the subsystem size, in agreement with the CFT prediction.",
    "Recent optical and near-infrared images have revealed a thin, comet-like structure around several young stars, dubbed comet-like tails. Observations of the 126my-old V4046 Sgr showed a double-tailed morphology with a separation of ˜0.5″, similar to that of comets. Subsequent studies have revealed that this is a rather common phenomena in young stars, found in roughly 30% of the investigated young stars. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observations, including close encounters with terrestrial planet-mass objects, loss of kinetic energy from the cometary-like extension, or jet-related feedback from the central star. However, direct observational evidence is still sparse. Here, we report on the ALMA observations of a transitional disk around the young star HD163296, with corresponding HST observations at optical wavelengths. We have identified distinct Na I absorption lines corresponding to the star, the disk and the halo of the transitional disk around HD163296. The observed spatial distribution and velocity structure of the Na I lines are well matched with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between the stellar ejecta and the disk. The observed absorption lines are consistent with the ejecta having a cometary morphology with a highly significant forward-facing tail. This is the first observational evidence for the interaction of supernoave ejecta with a protoplanetary disk.",
    "Active regions (ARs) are areas of the Sun where new solar activity, such as sunspots and flares, is likely to appear. It is important to understand the characteristics of these regions since they can have a substantial impact on the Earth's weather and environment. Traditionally, solar telescopes have focused on sunspots, seeing them as dark spots on a bright surface, but recent studies have shown that plage, the area around active regions in the Sun's surface, has a much higher contrast than sunspots. Fourier analysis is a common technique in the fields of signal processing and finance, where it is used to study the frequencies present in a signal. In this paper, we apply a form of Fourier analysis to plage regions on the Sun and identify frequencies present. These frequencies correspond to regions in the frequency-wavenumber plane where absorption and scattering events in the Sun's atmosphere occur. These atmospheric events are tied to the processes occurring in active regions and can be used to study their characteristics.",
    "Graph codes are a powerful family of error-correcting codes that find many applications in storage, transmission, and computation. For high performance, usually high rate codes are desired. But for high rate codes, maximum a-posteriori (MAP) decoding (optimized for maximum likelihood (ML) decoding) often requires large graph sketches that cannot be stored or transmitted efficiently. In this work we consider codes optimized for source/channel coding and binning. We introduce the concept of graph codes that are optimal for source/channel coding and binning (called cCBC-optimized graph codes). We then describe a simple algorithm to construct graph codes that are cCBC-optimized. We apply these codes to the compression problem and show that they allow to reduce the bandwidth of sum product decoding by a factor of 2, at the cost of only a small increase in storage. We also apply these codes to the problem of shaping and show that they allow to reduce the buffer size of list joint source channel coding by a factor of 2, at the cost of only a small increase in computation.",
    "Using data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, we study the spectral and timing properties of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34. We fit the continuum as well as photoelectric absorption edges of helium, carbon, and nitrogen using interstellar medium (ISM) models to simultaneously account for background emission and absorption. We model the reflection component using smeared edge functions to determine the global broadband continuum and absorption parameters. For three observations the source exhibited pulsations at a pulse period of 6.67 hr, confirming its neutron star nature. We find the surface gravity of the neutron star is high, and the mass of the compact object is at least 1.6 solar masses. The source exhibited high levels of absorption as well as localized regions of high absorption near 21.0 and 0.25 keV, which we ascribe to the edge absorption of ionized helium and neutral nitrogen, respectively. Using our new spectral results, we discuss previous observations and provide updated interpretations of these observations.",
    "Resolved stellar populations are critical probes of star formation histories and dynamical histories of galaxies. The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) provides an important benchmark for testing and developing techniques for interpreting observations of resolved stellar populations, owing to its proximity, well-determined position, luminosity, and age. Several studies have characterized the ONC with deep near-IR and HST data; however, their results are at odds regarding both the presence and nature of a Plummer-like IMF and the actual extinction toward the ONC. In this study, we use X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultradev deep survey to study the resolved stellar population in RCW49, a small local galaxy infalling into the Milky Way. We compare our results with the recent study of the ONC and discuss the impact of physical and observational parameters on the derived parameters. We also briefly discuss the possibility of comparing resolved stellar populations seen in different wavelength bands and the potential pitfalls.",
    "The VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars (VMSS) is aimed at studying the evolution of hot massive stars in the Local Group galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Wind properties and evolution of hot massive stars are key to understand feedback from massive stars in their environment, from the morphological structure of the interstellar medium to the chemical evolution of their host galaxy. Combined high-resolution spectroscopy from VLT-FLAMES allows to determine mass-loss rates from H emission, temperature of the bi-conical winds and thus analyze the evolutionary status of these stars. From the mass-loss rates, Ionic masses can be derived and eventually be used to investigate other properties of the winds, such as ionization degrees and acceleration regions with potential effects on simulations of the feedback into the environment. In this contribution we present the first results on the evolution of hot massive stars in the LMC and the impact of this evolution on the galactic feedback. We confirm previous studies which concluded that the initial mass function (IMF) is top-heavy in the LMC, with respect to the Milky Way. The most massive stars show stronger IMF divergence from the initial mass function (IMF) with increasing age, suggesting that these stars were affected by significant mass-loss episodes. We found more extreme cases of stars with abnormally high nitrogen to carbon (N/C) and nitrogen to oxygen (N/O) abundance ratios, which might be the consequence of a thermohaline mixing process occurring in their winds, an hydrodynamic process taking place in the strong winds of massive stars.",
    "Galaxy clusters have provided key astrophysical constraints over wide wavelength ranges from the radio to the X-ray. Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04 [@ds08]), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07 [@l06]; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84 [@k84]), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",
    "Recent detections of gravitational waves have opened a new window to the extreme Universe. Among the many candidate sources listed by several gravitational wave detectors, a binary system of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) has been firmly identified as the most plausible candidate for the first detection. Assuming that the coalescing SMBHs have low spin, their gravitational waveforms can be fully described by only two parameters: the mass and the symmetric mass ratio between the two holes. For several hours after the coalescence, during which the gravitational waveform is in the low-frequency band, phenomenological waveform models can accurately describe the signal. However, at later times the signal enters the high-frequency band and the waveform deviations from the TaylorT4 approximation become significant. The behavior of the waveform deviations indicates that the merger product has a spin that is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the SMBHs. This Letter reports a search for the radio counterparts of the final few hours of GW170104, the first event observed by Advanced LIGO. The search yielded no detection with the NRAO's Very Large Array at 1.4 GHz, which rules out some suggested explanations for the measurement of the supermassive black hole spin. We place new lower bounds on the fraction of SMBHs with SMBH spin in binary systems.",

The photoelectric effect (Maxwell's famous experiment) is among the most well-known and well-understood phenomena in physics. Yet, many students report difficulty learning and understanding this topic, in large part due to the complexity of the equations involved. We developed a four-week curriculum to teach the photoelectric effect that was informed by input from experts in the field, existing textbooks, and student interviews. Students took pre- and post- assessment tests and instructors evaluated students both pre- and post-assessment. Both the pre- and post-test consisted of multiple-choice questions, constructed-response questions, and short essay questions. All students showed significant improvement on the pre-test, on average, and most showed significant improvement on the post-test. Instructors evaluated the curriculum as being successful overall and suggested areas for improvement. In response to student requests, we plan to develop additional modules that address lessons learned from this curriculum.",
    "In this paper, we revisit the issues on Netflow sample and export performance. The traditional measurement of NetFlow performance only considers the number of flow samples, without considering the size of each sample. For example, the exported sample of large packet flow may occupy several hundreds of megabytes, which may cause the surveillance equipments to run out of disk space if the flow sample is not appropriately compressed. Besides, the large flow sample size may also affect the network traffic scheduling of the exporter and even cause certain low-level network applications to fail. In this paper, we propose a new metric Netflow export size, which considers both the size of flow samples and the size of each sample. We conduct several sets of experiments on both virtualized and physical environments. The experimental results show that the Netflow export size can better reflect the actual flow sample size and the impact on other network applications.",
    "We present a detailed chemical and dynamical analysis of five protostellar clusters in intermediate-mass star forming regions, around the sources I18198, I22134, I22134A, I22135, and I22134B. Through the combination of CH3OH and deuterated organic molecules (dcoms) data with dynamics from carbon monoxide (CO) observations we are able to determine the luminosities, gas masses, disk masses and binding energies of the protostars and their associated class 0/I outflows. We find that the protostellar disk mass distributions are similar to those seen in low-mass systems, with a median value of 0.015 M⊙. The four younger sources (I18198, I22134, I22134A, and I22135) are still embedded in protoclusters and present binding energies that are an order of magnitude greater than those measured for more evolved IM protostars (such as IRAS 16293-2422). In contrast, the older source I22134B is dissociated from its protocluster and its binding energy is consistent with that measured for more evolved systems. We suggest that the evolution of protostellar binding energies is not driven by the energetic effects of outflows, as has been previously proposed, but is instead intimately linked with the evolution of their natal protocluster.",
    "Recent X-ray observations with both ʻNewtonʼ and ʻRXTEʼ satellites revealed the presence of a soft excess above the thermal emission of the accretion disk in a significant fraction of Seyfert 1 galaxies. A popular hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is the reprocessing of hard X-rays in Compton-thick material around the central supermassive black hole. However, detailed studies of a few sources with ʻNarrow Field Instrumentsʼ failed to detect such columns of gas. We propose an alternative scenario in which the excess emission originates from electrons in the accretion flow instead of being direct from reprocessing. The electrons will inverse-Comptonize the UV/X-ray light emitted by the disk, and will be cooled through the Moliere process, producing a spectral signature significantly resembling the one observed. The model is consistent with the data from ʻXMM-Newtonʼ and ʻChandraʼ satellites and can provide a satisfactory fit to the soft excess in a large sample of objects.",
    "A search for planets transiting the M dwarf debris disk host AU Mic was performed using publicly available data from the WFIRST satellite and the European Extremely Large Telescope. No planet was found in the AU Mic system, placing an upper mass limit of 45 Mearth around AU Mic within 2.1 AU of the star, and a lower mass limit of 6 Mearth within 0.8 AU of the star. The lack of planets in this system, particularly super-earths, suggests that the system may have undergone dynamical processes that are stripping planetary populations, and/or that AU Mic may have an exceptionally high giant planet formation rate. The star AU Mic is an M4.5V type star located approximately 19.3 light-years from the Earth in the constellation Microscopium. Its debris disk has been spatially resolved with infrared data at 8.28 μm by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. In addition, the disk has been observed in thermal emission at shorter wavelengths at 24.5 μm with the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, at 70.0 μm with the Far-Infrared Surveyor Space Telescope, and at Submillimeter Array baselines of 8-240 m at 1.3 mm. Analysis of these data sets indicates that the disk may be compact with an inner radius of approximately 0.8 AU and an outer radius of 2.1 AU, assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100. AU Mic is estimated to be 11.5 billion years old. Several studies have claimed the detection of sub-millimeter planets around AU Mic. An analysis of the ALMA data failed to find any evidence of sub-millimeter emission from exoplanets in the AU Mic system. Conversely, a fit to the visibilities with two planets, one located at 0.93 AU and one at 2.26 AU, provided evidence for the planet at 0.93 AU but not for the one at 2.26 AU, which was attributed to high systematics in the data. Finally, a planet with a minimum mass of 6.3 Mearth was claimed in the spectral line of atomic sodium at 0.84 AU, and the possibility of a second super-Earth with a mass of 8 Mearth was considered but not ruled out. In this paper, I perform a search for planets around AU Mic. I download archival WFIRST data from the NASA Early Access Program, and use the Calar Alto High-Contrast Imaging Poller (CHAIPOD) to perform a pixel-level correlation search. I then download publicly available ESPaDOnS and SOPHIE data to confirm the results. I find no evidence of sub-millimeter emission from planets in the AU Mic system with a 3σ upper limit on the mass of any planet in the system of 6 Mearth. I also search for evidence of habitable zone planets but do not find any",
    "Esprimides Javier, Grigoryants Yaroslav and Trefil Boris. “Weak gravitational lensing in (2+1) gravity.” Physical Review D, 83.8 (July 2010): 084047. doi: 10.1103/PhysRevD.83.084047. In (2+1) gravity, which describes the spatial section of gravity in three dimensions, gravity has two propagating degrees of freedom instead of three. The lensing properties of (2+1) gravity were not studied before. In this paper, we calculate the deflection angle and the shear of light in (2+1) gravity and show that the theory allows for strong lensing, which could be tested with future astronomy. We use the exact solution of the (2+1) gravitational field generated by a point mass as a lens. We obtain an explicit expression for the deflection angle by the point mass in (2+1) gravity. For a point mass in (2+1) gravity the deflection angle is equal to two thirds of the inverse cube of the distance from the point mass to the source. We also calculate the shear of light in (2+1) gravity and show that the theory allows for strong lensing. Our findings can be tested with future astronomy and could be used to test (2+1) gravity.",
    "EF Cha is an unique star in our solar system. It has a close solar sibling named AD Cha, but has strong stellar emissions at mid-infrared. We carried out the first spectro-astrometric observation of EF Cha and did not observe any significant motion of the warm dust around the star. We conclude that the warm dust does not orbit around EF Cha, but is instead a member of the same stellar system as EF Cha and is heated by the same UV/optical/mid-infrared emission from the young star. --- EF Cha is an unique star in our solar system.

    "The COMBO-17 satellite surveyed 1.1 x 1.2 degrees of the northern sky in four bands of the near-infrared corresponding roughly to rest-frame visible light at wavelengths 0.65, 0.85, 1.35, and 2.2 μm. Here we analyze the galaxy morphologies and environment in the Abell 901/902 supercluster at redshift z = 0.33. This structure spans an area of approximately 20 square degrees, contains 775 galaxies with measured redshifts and is among the largest structures yet found at these redshifts. We find that 42% of the members of Abell 901/902 are early-type galaxies, an overdensity compared to the field. Particularly high fractions of early-type galaxies are found in the core of the supercluster at approximately 10 h$^{-1}$ Mpc and in a region of lower mean redshift of 0.31 compared to the rest of the structure at approximately 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, suggestive of a recent perturbation. We detect no large scale structure in the density distribution of late-type galaxies, although we note that this may be a consequence of the spatial resolution of the COMBO-17 survey, which is 6.2 h$^{-1}$ kpc at this redshift. We conclude that at least some of the early-type galaxies in Abell 901/902 are a result of recent merging and that the process of morphological transformation of cluster galaxies may be ongoing at this epoch.",
    "Interstellar dust grains are normally observed and studied in the infrared, where their thermal emission helps trace the distribution of dust in our galaxy and in other galaxies. However, a robust measurement of the mass of molecular clouds requires observations at shorter wavelengths, where the emission is not dominated by the thermal dust emission but rather by the much more subtle Rayleigh-Jeans thermal dust emission. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have performed such observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We detect multiple peaks in the thermal dust continuum emission from six regions known to host giant molecular clouds. The derived masses of these molecular clouds are between 430 and 1580 million solar masses, with a total mass of the SMC molecular clouds between 840 and 2380 million solar masses, making up between 25 and 63 per cent of the entire mass of the SMC. These numbers are significantly higher than previous mass estimates that did not account for the clumpiness of the SMC dust emission.",
    "In particle physics, the hierarchy problem is the difficulty of explaining the smallness of the electromagnetic force compared to the stronger nuclear forces. This has led to the suggestion that there is a vast overdensity of vacua in string theory, so the hierarchy problem is analogous to the way that there are many more galaxies than expected within each observable universe. It has been proposed that this supersymmetry (SUSY) may stabilize the weak scale. However, this assumes that all regions of the string landscape are highly connected, which is a natural consequence of current wisdom but has never been proven. I will present two new mechanisms by which this connection can be lost, creating forbidden territories in the string landscape. The first is uplifting a discrete symmetry, which can create a new domain wall at the string scale. This will generically divide the landscape into multiple domains, each with a different pattern of Kähler moduli stabilization and different fractions of the supersymmetry breaking hidden sector gauge group. The second is creating a new light species by deforming the worldsheet theory. This will create domains in the string landscape separated by forbidden zones where closed strings are not able to propagate, leaving the standard model fields localize on a domain wall. I will argue that both of these effects can naturally arise in a class of string theory models with dilaton stabilization, leading to a landscape with a large number of domains, with different patterns of SUSY breaking and moduli stabilization within each domain.",

    "A recent proposal for a physical implementation of the quantum NOT gate [1] has the potential to enable scalable quantum computing using superconducting qubits, opening the door to the construction of a large-scale quantum computer. Here, we show that the reliability of this physical realization of the quantum NOT gate is ultimately limited by dissipation arising from the preservation of the von Neumann entropy of the quantum system during its dynamics. In particular, we find that the infidelity of the quantum NOT gate in this realization, due to entropy accumulation, is constrained to be less than 0.067 over timescales required for quantum computation, significantly outperforming other proposed physical approaches to quantum computing. This analysis sets a new bar for quantum computing precision that can be exceeded only by approaches based on error suppression by active control. [1] M. S.

    "Noise can drastically change the behavior of a system. For example, in a system with feedback, a weak noise can induce instability, while a strong noise can promote stability. Here we report the experimental observation of a third regime: the suppression of growth by multiplicative white noise. We demonstrate that the addition of infinitesimal amplitude noise to a damped driven nonlinear system can stabilize the system. By performing direct numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we identify this unusual phenomenon to be associated with the parametric resonance. Our work highlights the different noise strategies that can be employed to stabilize a dynamical system and could have potential implications for the stabilization of real world systems. In this study, we experimentally observe that the addition of infinitesimal amplitude noise to a damped driven nonlinear system can stabilize the system. We demonstrate that the addition of infinitesimal amplitude noise can suppress the growth of zero-mean oscillations in a finite range of frequencies. This suppression of growth is quantified by using the mean-square amplitude of the oscillations. The addition of infinitesimal amplitude noise can stabilize the system.

    "Finite-size effects in roughness distribution scaling are discussed for interfaces in statistical physics, social science, and Earth science. The finite-size effects are important when the length scale of interest is comparable or smaller than the system size. This is typically the case for real-world roughness data, where the length scales of interest are typically within one order of magnitude smaller than the system sizes. For such data, the statistical properties may deviate significantly from the corresponding theoretical predictions based on infinitely large systems. In particular, two-point correlations in roughness are shown to be directly proportional to the surface area-to-volume ratio of the system. Examples of applications include but are not limited to evolution of power-law correlations in random growth models, and fitting of power-law roughness scaling to real-world data. Here we consider two well-known examples of the latter application: evolution of roughness correlations in random growth models and fitting of power-law roughness scaling to real-world data. For both applications, the surface area-to-volume ratio plays an important role. First, it determines how far two-point correlation functions can sense the length scale of interest. Second, it modifies scaling exponents that are determined from the slope of correlations at large length scales. These two factors are shown to conspire to yield the finite-size effects on the scaling of the surface area-to-volume ratio with length scale. Two scaling relations for two-point correlations are derived for system sizes from one to infinity. They are shown to be asymptotic to the theoretical predictions for large system sizes. Fitting of power-law scaling to real-world data is found to be particularly susceptible to the finite-size effects. This is because the range of correlation length scales of the data is very narrow, leading to large relative surface area-to-volume ratios. In contrast, theoretical predictions for infinitely large systems break down for the data. This article provides an overview of finite-size effects in scaling relations for real-world data, and points to some common pitfalls that should be avoided.",
    "Nanotubes are carbon allotropes with remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nanotubes can be grown in bundles, where the distance between adjacent nanotubes in a bundle is on the order of 1-10 nanometers. Here we study electromagnetic wave propagation in such tightly packed nanotube bundles. Contrary to predictions based on free space optics, we find that the wave propagation is governed by coupled nanotube Drude responses. These coupled responses are visible as longitudinal and transverse resonances in the scattering matrix spectrum. The latter resonance allows for non- dispersive waveguiding, with potential applications in filters, sensors, and communications. *Paper URL* : https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09142 The authors are from Nanotubes15, Link[1], New Jersey Institute of Technology.

    "The Millennium simulation is a large cosmological box which was carried out by the Virgo Consortium between 2000 and 2005. One of its outputs is a catalog of galaxy clusters, which was made public in 2008. I identify 21 red sequences in this catalog, using a technique that matches cluster galaxies’ colours to the location of the most massive member of the cluster. The scatter in the red sequence is 0.17 magnitudes, much lower than previously found, and is only statistically significant in the most dense regions of the clusters. I also show that the observed scatter is consistent with the observed colour-magnitude relation of the member galaxies, suggesting that galaxy evolution may be responsible.

    "A very massive star ends its life as a supernova by shedding its outer layers. These removed layers produce observable light and may be discernible in remnants of the star such as a planetary nebula (PNI). We report evidence for such pre-supernova mass loss in the enigmatic Galactic supernova remnant 3C 58 using images and spectra of its planetary nebula. We measure the mass of the central star and of the layer of ejected material using stellar evolution modeling, and we find pre-supernova mass loss parameters of α = 3.2 ± 0.4% and β = 0.9 ± 0.2, where α is the fraction of the star's mass lost in the stellar wind prior to the supernova explosion and β is the fraction of the star's mass lost in a prior shell ejection prior to the core collapse event. The large measured value of α is in contrast to previous suggestions of mild or no pre-supernova mass loss and suggests that the majority of the star's mass was lost in a prior ejection event. This supports the hypothesis that the progenitor star of 3C 58 was a member of a binary system at some point prior to the supernova explosion.",
    "Using data from the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), we have studied the gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region. The region is of interest due to its proximity and high concentration of massive black holes and pulsars. We performed a detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the 18 months of public observations covering the region. We find significant emission arising from the central 6 parsec, with spatial structures and spectral variations on both long and short time-scales. In particular, we identify a newly discovered MeV gamma-ray halo surrounding the central core. We investigate the possible origins of the emission, and find that both leptonic and hadronic processes are necessary to explain the data. In the former scenario, we consider both broad-line and narrow-line regions, and find that a combination of simple one-zone models are insufficient to explain the data. In the latter scenario, we consider the possibility of a population of fast transient sources. We find that a physical model in which distant supernova remnants collide with molecular clouds is consistent with the data, and require a dense wind of material from the central supermassive black hole to explain the gamma-ray halo. We discuss the testable implications of this model, and suggest future gamma-ray observations which may distinguish between the two scenarios.",
    "Galaxies in the young universe were first assembled during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), a period of rapid reconfiguration of the intergalactic medium (IGM) driven by energetic photons from young, highly luminous galaxies. Current observations of the Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of high-redshift quasars indicate that the IGM was reionized at $z = 7-8$ and that the process was largely complete by $z = 6$. Large volumes of the high-redshift universe have been observed by the HST and ground-based telescopes, but our understanding of the nature of reionization, especially the space density of galaxies responsible for heating the IGM, has been limited by the small sample of reionization-epoch sources available for study and the large effective volume over which they are observed. This paper presents new, deep, wide-field observations of the SSA22 field obtained with the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory that increase the number of observed high-redshift galaxies by more than an order of magnitude and improve the measurement of the volume-weighted quasar ionizing emissivity at $z = 7-8$ by an order of magnitude. These observations demonstrate the feasibility of targeting very high-redshift Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and demonstrate the power of large telescopes, particularly on northern mid-latitude sites, for extending our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization through improved observations of the most luminous high-redshift galaxies.",
    "Exoplanets are of great interest to scientists, not only due to the scientific value of the information that can be obtained about their physical and orbital properties, but also due to the possibility of finding life-hosting planets. Planets with surface temperatures compatible with the existence of life on Earth, known as habitable planets, can be discovered around the most abundant stars in the galaxy. A particularly attractive group of such planets are those with shorter periods of time between two successive transits across the face of their host star. Such planets are known as \"hot Jupiters\". The existence of such planets in the habitable zones of their host stars offers the possibility of rapid atmospheric studies using the methods of dynamical atmospheric spectrometry. The atmospheric composition can differ significantly from the composition of the planet's surface due to intense heat and pressure from the sun's light. Knowledge of the surface gravity is thus essential in order to correctly interpret the results of such studies. In this paper, we present a novel technique to accurately determine the surface gravity of transiting extrasolar planets by measuring the duration of the planet's ingress and egress with respect to its host star. We show that the surface gravity of the transiting planet can be determined with an error of less than 2% when the orbital period of the planet and the period of the host star are similar. In the case when the period of the star is half the period of the planet, the error in the surface gravity determination can be as high as 6%, but is always less than 13%. The most important factor influencing the determination of surface gravity is the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the radius of the star.",
    "In this paper we present a study of the metal-insulator transition in the low-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2FSO3 by means of infrared microspectroscopy. The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in (TMTSF)2FSO3 was first observed in 1981, and has been the subject of extensive studies since. The MIT occurs at Tc = 38 K and is associated with the two-dimensionalization of Fermi-surface sections caused by interlayer coupling. The compound exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas-oscillation-based evidence for 1D metallic behavior below 10 K. The optical conductivity spectrum undergoes a drastic change across Tc, which we attribute to the opening of a Mott-Hubbard gap in the metallicity below Tc. We observe characteristic features of a strongly correlated Mott insulator over a wide frequency range, which is consistent with reported transport, thermodynamic and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.",
    "Symmetry breaking is an ubiquitous phenomenon in physics. Symmetry breaking in the early universe has profound implications for our understanding of the universe at large. It may provide a mechanism for the generation of density and inhomogeneity perturbations, which can give rise to galaxies and clusters of galaxies via gravitational instability. It may also provide a seed for the development of long-range correlations in the form of Dark Matter. Furthermore, it may provide a way to understand the small density of dark energy relative to the scale of spatial inhomogeneities in the universe. In this paper, we consider the symmetry breaking pattern i.e. the Isometry group of spatially closed FRW universe, and show that it may, in fact, be enlarged to the pseudo-scale invariance (PSI) algebra. This leads to the possibility that Dark Energy may be associated with a scalar field with an exactly conformal coupling to gravity. Furthermore, it is shown that this PSI breaking can also lead to the small density of dark matter as well as the late-time acceleration of the universe. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the Isometry group of the spatially closed FRW universe and show that it may be enlarged to the PSI algebra. In Sec. 3 we show that this PSI breaking can also lead to the small density of dark matter as well as the late-time acceleration of the universe. The conclusion and some outlook are presented in the last section. In this paper we consider the possibility that the Isometry group of the spatially closed FRW universe may be enlarged to the pseudo-scale invariance (PSI) algebra. This leads to the possibility that Dark Energy may be associated with a scalar field with an exactly conformal coupling to gravity.

    "The multilayer samples with the approximate composition U0.2Fe0.8 acquired after mild annealing of the as-deposited samples with composition U0.2Fe0.8+x exhibit a ferromagnetic behavior at low temperatures. The Curie temperature Tc is strongly dependent on the annealing parameters. For x = 0.02 the ferromagnetic transition temperature is achieved at temperatures above room temperature, which is an advantage for practical applications. The variation of Tc with x indicates that the observed ferromagnetism is induced by the Fe layer. The effects of post-deposition heat treatments on the magnetic properties of U0.2Fe0.8+x are also investigated. Samples with x = 0.04 show a weak ferromagnetic behavior at low temperatures. The weak ferromagnetism is probably related to the clustering of U5+ ions into small clusters. The saturation magnetization is strongly reduced in comparison with the as-deposited samples. The samples with x = 0.08 exhibit a paramagnetic behavior at low temperatures. This result indicates that strong enrichment of U5+ leads to a magnetic null composition.",
    "The pulsar PSR J1930+1852 in the Crab-like SNR G54.1+0.3 was observed with the satellite XMM-Newton on 2011 April 7. The observation was made following the precise solar ephemeris generated by the PREM model. A search for a sinusoidal modulation in arrival times of the pulsar signal with period equal to the Earth's sidereal day was performed. No such signal was found, but a strict upper limit on the root mean square of the sinusoidal signal with periods equal to the Earth's sidereal day and the sidereal year was established. This limit, depending on the assumed properties of the signal, translates to a bound on the free parameters of possible physics models that could account for the observed properties of the pulsar J1930+1852 and the Crab Nebula in general. The most straightforward explanation of the signals detected in the pulsar timing data so far is the so called ”Shapiro delay” due to the curvature of space-time around the pulsar. A more exotic explanations, such as coupling of the axion field to the neutron, should also be considered.",
    "eternal inflation, de Sitter entropy In physics, entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. At early times in the history of the universe, the spacetime on sufficiently large scales was conjectured to obey de Sitter geometry, and the entropy was associated with the dimension of the corresponding de Sitter space. However, this conjecture was found to be incorrect on quantum gravity grounds. In particular, it was later shown that quantum corrections to the entropy of de Sitter space actually converge to a finite value. This was taken as a convincing example of the failure of the de Sitter entropy conjecture. In this paper, we will introduce a measure of de Sitter entropy which correctly accounts for quantum gravity corrections. We will then argue that this entropy is exactly equal to the Hubble rate during eternal inflation. We will also show that this entropy matches the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, leading us to propose that the latter is an exact quantum gravitational scale. This connection between the entropy of de Sitter space and the rate of expansion of the universe during inflation solves the paradoxes of de Sitter entropy and provides further evidence for the validity of the holographic principle in gravity. The proposed measure of de Sitter entropy, while not being a new fundamental constant of nature, does seem rather surprisingly analogous to the Hubble rate. We speculate on the possible implications of this analogy for the cosmic landscape, the multiverse, and string theory. Thesis: Entropy and the Geometry of Spacetime The entropy of a system is a measure of its disorder. Informally, it is the number of possible states that the system can be in minus one. This intuitively makes sense for systems consisting of many particles, where the number of ways the particles can be arranged is a measure of the system's entropy. In physics, the most common entropy measures are the Gibbs entropy (also known as the Boltzmann entropy) and the von Neumann entropy. They are both defined in terms of the partition function of the system. In general relativity, one defines the entropy of a spatial region to be the surface area of the region's unit normal sphere in a given vacuum geometry, as measured by an observer with appropriate idealizing physical assumptions. There are a number of reasons why this prescription for calculating the entropy is natural. First of all, the normal sphere is a natural generalization of the notion of a point to higher dimensional spacetimes. It is a minimal surface, and minimal surfaces are well-known to be sensitive to topology. In particular, the normal sphere is compact without being topologically a sphere, and this is why the entropy is a diffeomorphism-invariant. Moreover, it is reasonable to require the entropy to be calculated from an ideal observer without feeling too guilty about implicitly making assumptions about the mass and size of the region. The normal sphere also correctly accounts for Hawking radiation, as an observer in a slightly higher dimensional boundary layer would perceive",

It uses a symbolic deep neural network, trained on symbolic transformations of the data and an explicit CNF neural net to find a most general physical law given a training data set. The framework has been successfully applied to a synthetic data set, and the laws extracted can be shown to correctly describe the data generation process. Two case studies on physical laws extracted from physical experiments are also presented. This framework can be applied to other physical laws, especially those that can be described by partial differential equations, provided that a suitable data set exists.",
    "A multi-wavelength study of z = 3.15 Lyman-alpha emitters in the GOODS South Field is presented. Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies at redshift 3.15 is rare, and is one of the most distant light sources known. With the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), tens of thousands of distant galaxies have been discovered, extending the census of the high-redshift universe to higher redshifts than had been possible with previous techniques. These Lyman-alpha emitters (LAE) allow observation of the high-redshift universe during the \"Epoch of Reionization\" and can be used to study the process of structure formation. However, significant uncertainties remain about LAEs, including their number density, properties, and role in the Epoch of Reionization. To study these properties, we combine new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with existing imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, Subaru, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Using these data we search for LAEs and measure their physical properties, comparing them to a control sample of galaxies at low redshift. We find that LAEs at redshift 3.15 are lower mass, less luminous, less strongly clustered, and less likely to be detected in HST bands than galaxies at low redshift. These results are in agreement with expectations for population II galaxies at high redshift, and provide new constraints on the LAE population during the Epoch of Reionization.",
    "Stimulus and noise distributions for optimal information transmission via suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SR) are derived and exemplified for the archetypal nonlinear SR system, the diffusiely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Optimal information transmission is achieved for the full range of coupling constants when the information-carrying signal is a white noise, that is, it has zero mean. The optimal noise, in contrast, has a non-zero mean, and its variance vanishes as the signal amplitude increases past a critical value. The derived results provide clear design guidelines for maximizing the communication capacity of nonlinear dynamical systems through appropriate signal modulation. Introduction One of the longstanding paradigms of information transmission in nonlinear dynamical systems is stochastic resonance (SR), where a weak, random signal amplifies itself and noise-induced signal fluctuations are enhanced above the level of the signal's mean amplitude.1-3 For over three decades, this counterintuitive phenomenon has been demonstrated experimentally and corroborated with theory for various nonlinear systems, both experimental and theoretical.4-7 More recent studies have focused on information transmission via suprathreshold SR, where the signal is above a certain threshold level.8, 9, 10 The optimal signal structure for suprathreshold SR was shown to be a white noise, i.e., it has zero mean.11, 12 Here, we derive the optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission via suprathreshold SR. We focus on the archetypal diffusiely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, where the signal is the spiking activity of the neuronal model, and the noise represents background synaptic and neuronal noise.13, 14 In contrast to previous studies, the optimal information-carrying signal is not a white noise, but has a non-zero mean. Moreover, the optimal noise has a vanishing variance as the signal amplitude increases past a critical value, and the optimal information transmission performance is achieved for the full range of coupling constants. The derived results provide clear design guidelines for maximizing the communication capacity of nonlinear dynamical systems through appropriate signal modulation. Materials and methods We study information transmission via suprathreshold SR in the archetypal diffusiely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model,13, 14 which describes the dynamics of the membrane voltage of a neuron with the FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics,15 coupled to two linearly independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. The Langevin equations for the model read where {S t } are the amplitudes of the OU processes, {ν t } are Gaussian white noise terms, and ε is the coupling strength. The model displays bistability, i.e., it has two stable steady states, {S*±} = {−1, 1}, which correspond to the membrane potentials of the up and down states. The stable phases are separated",
    "In general relativity (GR), one of the principal methods of analyzing weak solutions to Einstein's field equations is the method of nonlinear perturbations, whereby a solution to the equations is analyzed in a perturbative sense around a more simple spacetime. Since the discovery of the Exact Solutions to the Einstein's field equations, a great deal of effort has been made to generalizations of the class of solutions to the nearly-flat and empty-universe variants of the theory. One of the assumptions in the derivation of the solvability conditions for the linearized field equations is that the background geometry is flat. Recently, two of the current authors (JSS and DSR) proposed a framework for analyzing weak solutions to the field equations that include generalizations of the nearly-flat and empty-universe solutions. The central idea in this framework is to relax the assumption of a flat background geometry to one of a curved background geometry. As a result, in addition to the equations satisfied by the perturbation(s) about the curved background, a global constraint on the perturbation is obtained. This constraint, which is a variant of the well-known Bel-Robinson vector field, guarantees that the curvature of the background geometry is propagated by the perturbation(s). In this paper, we provide a detailed exposition of these results for general relativity, general relativity with a negative cosmological constant, and generalizations of these two theories in the presence of a general matter content. We demonstrate the derivation of the perturbed field equations for each of these three theories, as well as the derivation of the global constraint, in both abstract index notation and in the language of tangent frames. This exposition is meant to serve as a tutorial for those not well-versed in general relativity and its applications, as well as as a detailed exposition for those versed in the subject. Furthermore, we have provided multiple appendices with details not central to the exposition.",
    "Recent experimental advances in the field of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) enable observation of novel forms of quantum many-body phenomena. Notably, engineering of driven-dissipative quantum systems has led to the observation of quantum phase transitions with light, namely, the Bose-Hubbard model. Integration of BECs with cavity quantum electrodynamics, another milestone in coherent light research, opens up the possibility of realizing effective gauge potentials for quantum particles. Here, we realize both these effects in a single chip device, and observe the formation of chiral supersolids and a chiral spin liquid. We demonstrate that a cavity-BEC platform has many potential applications, ranging from the discovery of new quantum phases to the implementation of quantum simulators and quantum information processing. The article provides an overview of recent experimental results in the field of cavity Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The authors demonstrate realization of both effective gauge potentials and the Bose-Hubbard model in a single chip device. Such integrated systems could find applications in quantum simulators and quantum information processing.",
    "Silicon surfaces present many intriguing phenomena owing to the large difference in electronegativity between silicon and oxygen. The regular stepping pattern on the (100) surface is one of the most notable examples, which has been observed for more than seven decades. The (110) surface, on the other hand, presents a similar structure but with a two-fold symmetry, which was first described in 1952 and termed the “densité échelonnée” (“stepped array of chains”). Due to its highly faceted shape, the (110) surface has been the subject of many recent studies. Here, we report high-resolution low-energy electron microscopy experiments that reveal a detailed reconstruction model for vicinal (100) and (110) surfaces. In addition to the well-known surface step density-wave pattern, we observe facet-induced bending of the steps and chains at the triple points between steps, leading to the formation of “V”-shaped steps. Using a simple model, we are able to explain the main features of this unusual reconstruction. The information we provide here should facilitate future experiments and simulations on these interesting surfaces.",
    "The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multi-band Imaging Photometer (MIPS) were mounted on the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the physical properties of galaxies by observing their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The data obtained by these telescopes can be used to study the Star Formation Rate (SFR) of galaxies by using different algorithms to measure their Mid-Infrared (MIR) SEDs. In this work, the calibration of these algorithms for the MIR SFR indicators is presented. The data used in this study was obtained from the Hi-GAL, GAMA and PACSplus surveys. A Large Sample Study (LSS) of these data was performed to find the SFR Indicators with the highest reliability. The data was analysed using three methods: 1) the neural network of the Random Forest algorithm, 2) the Bayesian Photometric Penalisation and 3) the Mean T Y Model. The results obtained show that the reliability of the measurements of the SFR Indicators using the MIPS 24 μm filter is better than that of the MIR SFR Indicators derived using the IRAC Channels 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the MIPS 24 μm filter. Furthermore, the best pair of indicators is IRAC 3 (8 μm) / MIPS 24 μm with a reliability of 0.84, followed by IRAC 4 (11 μm) / MIPS 24 μm with a reliability of 0.82. The reliability of the measurements of the SFR Indicators using the MIPS 70 μm filter is lower than that of the SFR Indicators derived using the IRAC Channels 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the MIPS 24 μm filter. Finally, a comparison between the SFR Indicators derived using these data and the SFR calculated using data from the ultraviolet (FUV) and far-infrared (60 μm) is performed. The SFR derived using the MIR SFR Indicators is consistent with the SFR calculated using the FUV and 60 μm data.",
    "In this paper we combine ideas from parametric approximation, Monte Carlo methods and optimism to develop an algorithm that efficiently finds high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. We present an algorithm that starts with any algorithm for solving a problem and provides a flexible way to customize the solution by tuning a few parameters. The algorithm generates many trials by running the base algorithm for a number of parameter values and picks the best ones. The approach is illustrated on a numerical optimization problem. We also develop a theory for analyzing the performance of this algorithm and proving its convergence. We demonstrate that the algorithm consistently finds high-quality solutions to a wide range of combinatorial problems. Learning and optimization have several key components. We need to have a good model of the problem and an efficient method to search over the model parameters. This allows us to find high-quality solutions to a problem. These components have been separately studied in different communities for different types of problems. We present an algorithm that can effectively combine these components to find high-quality solutions to a broader range of problems. The algorithm can start with any algorithm and provide a way to custom design the algorithm. We use this framework to develop a theory for analyzing the performance of this algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm consistently finds high-quality solutions for a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems. There are multiple ways to design algorithms for learning and optimization. Our framework focuses on combining model-based and black-box optimization techniques. We use the first technique to find good initial points for the second technique. We present a theory for analyzing this algorithm and provide performance guarantees. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a number of experiments. We develop the algorithm and the theory for solving a discrete problem. The approach can be adapted to work on problems defined on continuous spaces. The algorithms in this framework can be used for many machine learning problems. This includes the following areas: - Supervised learning - Unsupervised learning -reinforcement learning -dimensionality reduction -colaborative filtering -semi-supervised learning -reinforcement learning -perturbation-based method The approach can also be used for many different optimization problems. This includes the following areas: - combinatorial optimization - continuous optimization - semidefinite optimization - quantum optimization - operations research The algorithm has three key steps. We first develop methods to efficiently search over the parameter values. We then present a framework that uses a model to find high-quality solutions. We then combine the two components to find high-quality solutions. This approach can be applied to a broad range of problems. However, the approach will not work well if the base algorithm is not efficient or if the parameter space is not well structured. The algorithm will also not work well if the objective function is not well behaved or if the answer has to be close to a solution with high probability. We demonstrate the approach for a",
    "Studies of the chemical and dynamical properties of the stellar halo have been performed in two separate, but complementary, directions. Observationally, candidate members of the stellar halo have been identified by their unusual kinematic characteristics in the Milky Way's observed gravitational field, leading to the characterization of several stellar streams. For some of these, high-resolution spectroscopy has confirmed them to be old, sparsely populated systems with Galactically isotropy spatial distributions and large apocentric distances. While the radial velocity components of some of these systems may be interpreted as resulting from recent accretions, other system-proper motions are wholly consistent with those of the classical satellites of the Milky Way. More direct clues to the nature of the stellar halo come from surveys of the outer Galaxy. Searches for variable stars and RR Lyrae variables have identified the stellar halo as a metal-poor population. Stellar neighbors of several candidate halo stars are being scrutinized for chemical peculiarities through medium-resolution spectroscopy. A clear gap in the metallicity distribution of nearby stars is observed for several stars with strongly retrograde Galactic velocities. Recent evidence from studies of the chemical and dynamical properties of the stellar halo has confirmed the long suspected nature of its metal-poor nature and provided further hints of its accretion origin. While its stellar number density is in remarkable agreement with expectations based on simple dynamical models of the Milky Way's outer components, the available evidence is less compelling for its accretional origin. At present, there is still room for more direct clues to the nature of the stellar halo through searches for chemical peculiarities.",
    "The paper studies the problem of regularizing a wide range of divergent series using free additive convolution, square and rectangular cases. It derives several useful formulas to compute the corresponding regularization parameters, and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach with some numerical examples. Fantastic. Thank you for sharing. Here is a longer abstract that addresses the motivation and context of the paper: Ever since the seminal works of Hardy and Littlewood, it is well-known that adding a singular term to a divergent series can render it convergent. This phenomenon, which can be traced back to the underlying asymptotics of the summands, has seen a flurry of activity in the past few years with applications to computer science, geometry, probability, and several other areas of mathematics. While the absolutely convergent case (i.e., the addition of a constant to the series) has a long and celebrated history, understanding the divergent case has been an elusive goal for decades. While major breakthroughs have been made in recent years (most notably, by Borodin,Callback, and Guennouni), there are still many aspects of this problem that are poorly understood. In particular, even for simple divergent series such as the harmonic series, there is no consensus on the optimal way to regularize it. In recent work, it was observed that there is an intimate relation between this problem and certain problems in free probability theory, and this connection could be exploited to obtain powerful results (for instance, the optimal regularization parameter turns out to be a non-trivial free multiplicative convolution). However, this approach only yields a partial solution to the problem, and leaves many important questions open. First, while the result only applies to the harmonic series, it is not clear what additional structure on the series is needed to apply it. Second, while free probability is a powerful technique that allows one to compute certain asymptotic properties of random sequences, its natural applications to series definitions are more or less immediate but the formulas that are obtained are very opaque. In this work, we take a step in this direction by providing a simpler and more direct derivation of these free probability results. This reveals a deep connection between regularization and factorization of random variables, which suggests a variational approach to the problem. Using this approach, we are able to obtain not only a complete solution to the problem of regularization of divergent series, but also obtain new insights and results in this area. Specifically, we consider a general class of divergent series that includes many examples of interest, and show that they can all be regularized via three operations: addition, square, and rectangular convolution with a suitable function. We then derive general formulas for the corresponding regularization parameters, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with some numerical examples. The results obtained are very general, and can also be interpreted in the context of dynamical systems. This can be used to explain some of the results and computations, or to derive",
    "We present the first complete simulations of the collisional evolution of Kuiper Belt (KB) objects (KBOs). We calculate the dynamical evolution of test particles placed in heliocentric orbit typical of those of the KB objects Eris, Sedna, and Orcus. From these simulations, we calculate the physical evolution of these objects' surfaces, collisional lifetimes, geology, lithologies, compositions, and dynamical membership in the Parenago segregation category. All of the relevant processes studied herein have observational signatures in the emitted light that we also model. We also calculate how the spectra of these objects would change if they had differentiated. The majority of the observed colors, reflectance spectra, and visible-light spectra of the KB objects we studied are the result of static clouds of regolith superimposed on underlying differentiated surfaces. We suggest that visible-light spectroscopic observations of such objects might allow discrimination between these models, if, for example, albedo or feature spacing data were available. Additionally, a global color observation may be possible if the object's spectrum was measured at multiple phases. We provide appropriate recommendations for future observational searches for surface differentiation and present an observing strategy to maximize the probability of observing this phenomenon.",
    "We analyze elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for the 7Li+208Pb system at near-Coulomb-barrier energies using the folding potential. This is a systematic exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) in the system. The potential has 27 parameters that were fitted to a large data base of experimental elastic scattering and fusion cross section data. We also perform a constrained global diagonalization of the coupled-channels Hamiltonian to determine excitation energies and residues. The resulting PES is very deep and has a global minimum close to the separatrix. The appearance of the deep PES could have important implications for the behavior of projectiles very close to heavy targets. *This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics under Award No. DE-FG02-94ER40834. The potential energy surface (PES) for the 7Li+208Pb system is analyzed by performing an extended optical model analysis of elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for the system. Fitting a large data base of elastic scattering and fusion cross section data to a potential energy surface has the potential to greatly simplify the analysis. With a well-parameterized PES, one can predict the outcome of future experiments and make novel observations that can help guide the further refinement of the PES.

    "In this paper, we investigate the geometric and topological properties of the cosmological solutions in the standard model of cosmology called the Lambda-CDM model. We first show that the phase-space of this model admits a symplectic structure and it inherits the scalar nature of the gravitational sector. We then study the possible topologies and smoothness of the resulting Universe and we conclude that it is a singular spacetime with a nontrivial homotopic group. The research was carried out within the framework of the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Ulster University, Ireland. --- Geometry and Topology in Relativistic Cosmology In this paper, we investigate the geometric and topological properties of the cosmological solutions in the standard model of cosmology called the Lambda-CDM model. We first show that the phase-space of this model admits a symplectic structure and it inherits the scalar nature of the gravitational sector. We then study the possible topologies and smoothness of the resulting Universe and we conclude that it is a singular spacetime with a nontrivial homotopic group. The research was carried out within the framework of the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Ulster University, Ireland. This result shows that, in the standard model of cosmology, the Universe does not have the same smoothness as in general relativity and its homotopic group is nontrivial. The importance of these results stems from the fact that they have not been reached so far, at least not in a mathematically rigorous manner. In the light of recent observations suggesting the almost flat universe, these results are likely to have important cosmological implications. Finally, we note that the differentiable structure of this model still permits a nonsingular solution, namely the de Sitter space.",
    "The process by which mass is removed from a region and replaced by new material is called outflow, and is important in the evolution of most objects. A complementary process in which more material is brought into a region than can be removed by outflow is called inflow. Understanding both outflow and inflow is important in determining the long term evolution of regions. In this paper we investigate these processes using data from the Disk observations with the * Mars mission. We identify 28 sources that may be sites of both outflow and inflow. These data suggest that the mass added to a region by inflow may be comparable to the mass removed by outflow. * Mars Global Surveyor Massive Star Forming Regions (Mειvellous names, don't you think?) are a fundamental part of the evolution of our Galaxy. Over time, new material (outflow) is removed from the region, and replaced by new material (inflow). By understanding both outflow and inflow, we can understand the evolution of the region as a whole. To study this process, we use data from the * Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission. *Mars Global Surveyor was the last of the Discovery-class Mars orbiters, and carried the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), which has significantly better imaging capabilities than the previous rovers (Pathfinder and Sojourner). The MGS was placed into a 700km sun-synchronous orbit in 2006, and has been studying the atmosphere of Mars since. The MOC has been used to study a number of interesting features on Mars, including landing sites for future missions. We identified 28 sources that may show evidence of both outflow and inflow. These sources cover a range of potential difference -- from pure outflow sources to pure inflow sources. The presence of both inflow and outflow at the same location would be unexpected if these were independent processes. We are currently analyzing these data to determine if we can confirm that inflow and outflow occur at the same location, and whether the relative rates of these processes are similar to what we would expect based on prior studies of similar regions. The paper will be submitted to the journal \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\", and can be accessed here: <http://www.mast.server.com/mgs/publications/mjpaper.html> As a side-note, I just wanted to provide a little insight into how much I enjoy working with data from the *Mars Global Surveyor mission. This has been an incredibly fun project, and I have learned a tremendous amount about astronomy from the process. *Mars Global Surveyor, along with the other spacecraft (including Odyssey, MESSENGER, and the Martian rovers) provide an invaluable archive of data on the Red Planet, and continue to provide critical insights into the geological history of the Solar System's only planet.

    "The line intensities of several key molecules have been measured in molecular clouds located in different Galactic environments. These include translatory thermal lines of CO, an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen, as well as the HCN, CS and CO isotopes' rotational thermal lines. Conversion factors are derived between the line intensities and the properties of the molecular clouds, such as their mass, temperature and density. The derived factors are specific to the different types of galaxies and are given for Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd and Irr galaxies. It is shown that the line intensities of CO, HCN and isotopes can be used as quantitative measures of the masses of molecular clouds.

    "In this work, we consider a multiple-antenna fading channel with a quantized precoding matrix. The transmitter uses linear precoding to send signals to a receiver with multiple antennas. To illustrate the capacity of this channel, we first consider the non-precoding case and characterize the capacity with the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR), where the quantization is imposed at both the transmitter and the receiver. We then consider the case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and characterize the capacity for two different scenarios: when the SQNR is large, i.e., with high-precision quantization; and when the SQNR is small, i.e., with low-precision quantization. Through numerical results, we show that both the non-precoding and ZF precoding cases achieve similar performance for high SQNR, but that precoding can significantly increase the capacity for low SQNR.",
    "We present new radio observations of 38BAL quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic database. The radio observations include very long baseline array (VLBA) observations at 5, 8, 14.5, and 22 GHz, plus data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeter survey (FIRST), the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), and the Texas Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (TSSDM). Approximately 90% of the sample has been detected by these surveys at radio wavelengths, and 37 have upper limits at longer wavelengths. We perform a thorough analysis of the radio through X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sample and compare these to optical and X-ray data. In most cases, we do not detect radio cores, and we analyze the emission from extended components only. We find that approximately two-thirds of the sources have a rising or flat radio SED at frequencies below 10 GHz, while the remaining one-third have a declining or heavily inverted radio SED. Many of the sources have X-ray absorption significantly in excess of the Galactic value. We argue that an unusual orientation relative to the radio-loud nucleus and/or jet is responsible for the radio emission in the flat- or rising-spectrum subsample, and the steep spectra of this subsample are more likely due to beaming caused by the relativistic jets. We consider the implications of our results for high-energy emission in these sources and note that the flat- or rising-spectrum subsample is a good candidate for future radio observations in order to test whether Doppler beaming plays a significant role in their radio emission.",
    "The paper shows how the IT Service Centre at Harz University, a 100-people team operating in the scope of Group Information and Communication, utilised the ITIL service management framework. In order to illustrate its practical relevance, the framework is applied to the Release Management Process, showing improvements that were enabled by using the ITIL methodology. The paper concludes with some lessons learned and a discussion of how these can be applied to other processes. The ITIL framework was originally developed by the British government to support the implementation of best practices in the management of Information Technology services in the public sector. In recent years, the framework has also gained popularity in the private sector. Following an evaluation of the framework’s applicability to IT service management in a university setting, this paper shows how ITIL can be used to benefit such a setting. To this end, the Release Management Process of the IT Service Centre at Harz University is utilised as a concrete example. The process is analysed to determine areas in which it could be improved by using ITIL, and these improvements are illustrated using the example of the used of ITIL in the Release Management Process.",
    "We present the results of a search for diffuse optical streams in a sample of 71 low-redshift ($z < 0.2$) groups and clusters of galaxies. We used deep imaging of a 1.7 square degree field around the south Galactic pole with the GRavitational lOng Survey Telescope Array (GRAvaroo), which is composed of five small optical telescopes. After careful application of various data quality filters, we identify three candidate systems with coherent, faint, linear streams of stars consistent with a stream-like configuration of the disrupted satellite galaxies. The brightest of these three candidates, with a heliocentric recessional velocity of 14,200 km/s, is consistent with other confirmed satellites of the Milky Way at lower heliocentric velocities, supporting its identification as a dark-matter-dominated stream. The other two candidates, with heliocentric recessional velocities of 24,300 km/s and 32,300 km/s, have very low satellite galaxy contamination and can each be plausibly associated with an identified accretion event in the fossil record, suggesting that the streams have physical properties similar to those of previously-observed cosmological streams. If confirmed, these systems would represent the lowest-redshift galaxies containing streams of stars arising from the disruption of satellite galaxies and would represent a record of some of the most massive accretion events in the local volume. These results suggest that wide, faint, linear features may be a common property of galaxy groups and clusters at low redshift, even in the absence of massive central galaxies, and that these systems may represent important constituents of the overall cosmological stream population.",
    "The massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1 is one of the closest analogues of a typical starburst galaxy. Located some 20,000 light-years away in the constellation of Carina (the pointy car), Westerlund 1 is home to hundreds of massive stars, including several of the most massive known in the galaxy. However, despite its proximity, Westerlund 1 has remained a challenging target for observation because it is embedded in a dense, neutral environment created by the combined effects of its own powerful ionizing radiation field and the deeper ultraviolet light produced by its massive stars. Using data from the Herschel Space Observatory, we report on the detection of a small amount of cooling radiation from this environment—the first direct evidence of the small amount of gas that does exist within the core of Westerlund 1. This, together with measurements of the dispersion of its member stars’ proper motions, allows us to put an upper bound on the cluster’s distance of between 12 and 18 kpc, well within the estimated 20-30 kpc diameter of the ionizing radiation region. Our findings provide constraints on the initial mass of Westerlund 1’s most massive stars and the age of its youngest members, and support the notion that Westerlund 1, despite its proximity, may be very similar to other young, massive star clusters that have been observed in the local universe.",

    "In this paper, we study dynamical properties of fluid of platelike colloidal particles. This subject has been recently studied experimentally [1-3]. In our study, we apply computer simulation techniques. We consider bidisperse mixture of platelike and spherical colloidal particles. We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. In our system, platelike particles have two equal square-shaped faces and diameter d. Spherical particles have a diameter d/2. We study dynamical properties of our system in the range of volume fraction 0.621 ≤ϕ≤ 0.895 and averaged number of platelike particles NPl=100, 200, and 300. In this range of ϕ and NPl, we study transients and long-time dynamical behavior of self-intermediate scattering function S(q,t) and pair-intermediate scattering function S(q,t) for different values of q. We observe dynamical behaviour including exponential decay of transients, quasiequilibration and growing of correlation functions toward exact hydrodynamics at long times.",
    "Galaxy clusters are the largest known structures in the universe, containing hundreds or even thousands of galaxies. Despite their importance, it is not easy to study the large-scale behaviour of cluster galaxies. Most of the time one has to resort to studying individual galaxies or small samples. A promising approach is to model the overall galaxy light distribution and use the resulting model to fit the light of distant galaxies. Such an approach was proposed by Falco et al. in 1987 and implemented on large datasets by Gonzalez et al. in 2002. Since then, several improvements and adaptations to different galaxy samples have been proposed. We present the dataset of early-type galaxies in the WINGS clusters, a multi-wavelength catalogue with morphological classification, HST imaging and extensive follow-up data. The dataset has been modelled and fitted using three different techniques: non-parametric SFH modelling, bulge+disk decomposition and semi-parametric Boxy4 modelling. The results indicate that both star formation history and bulge prominence have varied during the lifetime of clusters.",
    "Modules over operads and their relationship to functors have been the subject of much recent work. The most precise of these results, a strong form of the Yoneda lemma, equates modules over an operad with functors from that operad to the category of abelian groups. This result relies on work of Smith and others in the derivation of a module over a PROP from a functor into the category of chain complexes. The method of proof relies on the structure of PROPs as universal algebras. We show that a version of the Yoneda lemma holds for small, skeletal operads, including those corresponding to stable, homology theories. A simple proof of the skeletal Yoneda lemma applies to any operad in well-generated monoids in spaces. This generalizes the classical theorem of Barratt and Eisenbud that coherent rings correspond to associative, unital monoids in spaces. The skeletal version of the Yoneda lemma implies the more precise form. We give a number of examples of skeletal operads arising in homology theories, including K-theory, connective K-theory, extended K-theory, complex bordism, and motivic homology theories.",
    "In this paper, we present a communication model for adaptive service provisioning in hybrid wireless networks that consist of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands. We consider a communication-enabled wireless network where wireless services are hosted by servers and the hosts can be connected to the wireless networks through access points (APs). The AP access information (licensed or unlicensed) is dynamically shared with the servers using a reverse proxy which we call the spectrum guardian (SG). The SG then adapts its behavior to provide the services either over licensed or unlicensed spectrum bands. We formulate the problem of adaptive spectrum band selection for delivering services over air as a coupled multi-agent coordination and spectrum band selection optimization problem. We employ game-theoretic techniques to solve the formulated problem. We provide a rigorous performance analysis for the proposed spectrum band selection algorithm. We also evaluate the performance of the formulated problem using extensive simulations and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed spectrum guardian algorithm.' We perform simulations to study the performance of the SG in various network settings with different number of spectrum guardians and servers. We also consider different spectrum management policies and evaluate their performance under the SG framework. We show that by using the SG, the AP access information can be shared with servers in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner, thereby enabling flexible spectrum management while ensuring an efficient use of the spectrum bands.' Our proposed SG spectrum band selection algorithm can adapt to various network and spectrum management policies and can ensure a minimum performance under any network setting. This enables our SG to efficiently exploit the benefits of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands for delivering wireless services to the servers.' Our proposed SG not only helps the spectrum managers in efficiently utilizing the licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands but also enables the servers to seamlessly enjoy the benefits of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands for delivering their services to the end-users.' We also study the performance of the SG in a cache-aided network setting with different cache strategies. We show that by properly using the cache, the SG can greatly improve the system performance under both uncached and highly dynamic network settings. We provide a performance bound for the SG with optimal cache usage and demonstrate its performance close to the bound.' author: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",
    "Lithium-like ions have been widely used as tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations due to their simple structure. In this work QED calculations of the 2p1/2-2s and 2p3/2-2s transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting in lithium-like scandium are presented. Theory and experiment agree to within 4.2% and 5.2% for the two transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting, respectively. The 2s2 2p(1/2)2p(3/2) and 2s2 2p(3/2)3s bound-states energies of lithium-like scandium were calculated using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) theory including all single and double electron relativistic, quantum electrodynamic (QED) and electron correlation corrections. The 2p1/2-2s and 2p3/2-2s transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting were estimated by combining the MCDHF energies with the relativistic many-body perturbation theory and all order charge delocalization correction methods. The results were compared to the available experimental data and good agreement was obtained.",
    "In this paper, we review some of the most recent results obtained in our laboratory concerning the calculation and measurement of thermal Casimir force between real materials. Casimir forces are long-range, quantum electromagnetic forces that arise from the modification of the zero-point energy spectrum of the quantum electromagnetic field due to the presence of boundaries. Forces of this kind play an important role in nanotechnology, because they can influence the equilibrium position of molecules or mechanical components and may provide a useful mechanism of actuation. The latter aspect is of special interest in developing new micromechanical devices. At finite temperatures, there are two distinct contributions to the Casimir energy, the so-called ideal or thermal term and the nonideal or quantum term. The ideal term is obtained by simply multiplying the zero-point energies of the quantum electromagnetic field in the respective regions. The nonideal term, on the other hand, accounts for the changes in the zero-point energy induced by the presence of boundaries. At room temperature, the ideal term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the nonideal term and may therefore be neglected. At low temperatures, on the other hand, the nonideal term becomes increasingly larger than the ideal term and may even change the direction of the force acting between two objects. This phenomenon is known as thermal capt. The topic of this paper is the calculation and measurement of the thermal Casimir force between real materials. In particular, we will focus on two prototypical systems, namely, two parallel plates made of gold and covered with a layer of teflon, and a crossed grid of stainless steel wires mounted on a copper plate. In order to calculate the thermal Casimir force, we use the so-called Green's function method. The experimental setup for measuring the thermal Casimir force is based on the recent invention of W. J. Kim and H. M. Chan of the Stanford Research Systems Inc. (SRS). This setup is able to measure the force with a very high precision. We have performed measurements of thermal Casimir force between the two parallel plates and between the crossed grid and the plate. We have also calculated the thermal Casimir force between the two parallel plates using different theoretical models, including the so-called proximity force approximation. We found excellent agreement between the measured and calculated values of the thermal Casimir force.",
    "In this paper we describe the action of the absolute Galois group on the set of connected components of the moduli space of surfaces of general type. We show that this action is faithful and topological, i.e. does not preserve the underlying schemes. Let X be a smooth projective variety over a field k. The absolute Galois group of k, written Gal(k), acts on the set of connected components of the Hurwitz scheme of models of X over finite fields. We show that this action is faithful if and only if X is not rational. We then show that the action of Gal(k) on the set of connected components of the Hurwitz scheme is topological if and only if the Picard number of X is at most 1, if and only if the canonical bundle of X is trivial. We apply this result to describe the action of Gal(k) on the set of connected components of the moduli space of surfaces of general type.",
    "An Infrared Cloud Monitor was developed for the Haleakalaan robotic telescope at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife, Spain. The instrument was designed to image the thermal emission from thin clouds in the atmosphere in the wavelength region between 3.8 μm and 14 μm. This paper describes the design, development and initial tests of the ICM. Observations with the ICM of infrared emission from thin cirrus clouds are presented. The observed clouds had linear dimensions between 1 km and 10 km with a median size of 3.3 km. They were located at altitudes between 2.2 km and 7.2 km. The Infrared Cloud Monitor was designed, developed and tested over a period of 18 months. The system is composed of several subsystems. The main control and data acquisition system was developed with the VICON motion analysis system. The instrument package for imaging the thermal emission from thin clouds is mounted on a three-axis stage allowing it to be pointed at the cloud of interest. The ICM obtains data through a series of exposures with an uncooled MCT-LPS sensor and focal plane assembly in order to map the cloud in the desired spectral region. Each exposure is 10 s long and the data is aquired at a rate of 10 Hz. The ICM images are constructed from the time series of images and a median filter is applied to remove high frequency noise from the data.",
    "Using an asymmetric beam splitter and sending only a small portion of the incoming atoms through one arm of the interferometer, we enhance the tunneling probability through the potential barrier relative to the classical limit. For small splitter asymmetry and assuming that all other parameters are fixed, we derive an expression for the enhancement factor that increases quadratically with the nonlinearity coefficient. For reasonable values of the nonlinearity coefficient in an ensemble of hyperfine states of cesium atoms, we obtain a 100-fold enhancement of the tunneling probability. Our approach can be readily implemented in existing matter-wave interferometry setups and can be of use, for example, for measuring small deviations from classical gravity or high-accuracy inertial sensors. The authors are Dmitry Budker, Andrey Derevianko, and Yi-Pei Chen In this paper, we propose using a nonlinearity-assisted quantum tunneling in a matter-wave interferometer for high-accuracy inertial sensors and small deviations from classical gravity.

    "Four-fermion interaction models are very attractive theories with diverse phases. In particular, the Gross-Neveu model in 1+3D (1 spatial + 3 temporal dimensions) with a positive mass parameter has a phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Its order parameter is a difermion condensate. In this model the phase transition is of second order. In 2D the model has a phase with fermion condensation and a phase with dimerization. The model in 3D with a positive mass parameter also has a phase with difermion condensation, which is, however, of first order. On the negative mass square plane, the system has a U(1) symmetry with a Goldstone mode. In 2D, the model has a phase with condensation of Jordan wigners and in 3D it has a phase with condensation of bosonic dimers. In this work, we study a general 2-4D model with four-fermion interaction. We find that in 2D this model also has a phase with difermion condensation, and on the negative mass square plane it has a U(1) symmetry with a Goldstone mode.",
    "In recent years, space exploration has brought humanity closer to answering the age-old question of whether there is life on other planets. One of the main challenges for exoplanet hunters is identifying the chemical signatures of possible life on planets outside our solar system. A potential telltale biosignature is a cirrus cloud with a high albedo, or reflectivity, which could bounce light from a planet’s surface into space and cast a dark shadow on the planet’s surface. Here we report the gamma-ray albedo of the moon, a measure of its gamma-ray absorption cross section above 30 MeV, from a sample of gamma-ray lines from 1 MeV to 1 TeV obtained by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We find that the albedo of the moon is around 0.32, consistent with estimates based on soil composition. This high albedo value is due to the fact that the lunar surface is covered with anorthosite rock formed by the crystallization of volcanic ashes from the impacts of meteorites 3.9 billion years ago. Given the vast number of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy, the gamma-ray albedo of the moon could serve as an efficient method to identify biosignatures on planets orbiting other stars.",
    "Polarization states of the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) remain encoded in the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To probe these states, we introduce a novel statistic, the Stokes parameter variance (SPV), and develop new methods to analyze future cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We show that an experiment with sky coverage of 5,000 square degrees and noise level of ~0.01 σ(SPV) can probe the (spin up ⟂ ↗, spin down ⟂ →) states with a significance of 5 σ. This can be extended to the 24-dimensional parameter space of (⟂ ↗, ⟂ →, ⟂ ∥, ⟂ ⊥) by adding low resolution CMB polarization observations. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by simulating the gravitational wave foreground and showing that the SPV measurement is largely insensitive to these foregrounds. We apply our method to ongoing CMB temperature and low resolution polarization observations and place constraints on the amplitudes of the spin-2 operators generated by gravitational waves in the estimated skies. Our approach is entirely data-driven and does not make any prior assumptions about the theory or the foreground nature of the observations. We provide an easy to use publicly available software package for polarization estimation from future CMB observations.",
    "Longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops are known to undergo torsional oscillations when the longitudinal twist exceeds a critical value. This Letter shows that the twist evolves as a function of time and forms longitudinal inhomogeneous kinks that are then twisted. This process can explain many features of torsional oscillations that have been observed. This model can be used to understand the dynamics of twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere. Longitudinal inhomogeneity is essential to the formation of kinks. An analytical kink solution is found and numerical results are provided for both the kink evolution and the oscillation of twist. A twisted kink loop is simulated and shown to reproduce many features of observed torsional oscillation loops. The oscillation period is sensitive to the half-length, thickness and twist of the loop. These results may have applications in solar magnetohydrodynamics and in the interpretation of solar UV bursts. Longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops undergo torsional oscillations when the longitudinal twist exceeds a critical value. This critical twist increases with the longitudinal loop inhomogeneity. A twisted kink loop is a fundamental solution of the equilibrium twist evolution. By developing, we mean twisting more than is necessary to satisfy the twist evolution equation. The twist evolves as a function of time and forms longitudinal inhomogeneous kinks that are then twisted. This process can explain many features of torsional oscillations that have been observed.",
    "In August 2022, a hitherto unnoticed dwarf galaxy passed near the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Optical observations by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope, which is located on Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii, revealed a massive globular cluster, similar in colour and magnitude to the LMC, trailing behind the dwarf. Spectroscopic follow-up with the Keck I and II telescopes showed the globular cluster to be extremely metal-poor, with an average metallicity of only 5% of the solar value. The only other known object of such low metallicity is the Small Magellanic Cloud. The only possible explanation for the formation of this object is the infall of a relatively massive galaxy in the early stages of its evolution. We conclude that this object is the remains of a galaxy nucleus that has been stripped of its gas and is currently being assimilated into the LMC. This remarkable object shows that galaxies can interact with one another in unexpected ways.",
    "We present a detailed study of the physical properties of a sample of 50 MgII absorbers at z = 2.5 (1+z = 2.5), selected from the SSA22 field based on visual and model fits to their spectra, and observed with the FMOS and GES at the Subaru Telescope. By fitting the Mg II and metal lines in the quasar spectra with synthetic spectra we measure their physical properties: gas phase metal abundances, velocity widths and internal gas pressures, the latter of which we utilize in combination with the Mg II column densities to calculate the total mass of the gas halos. We compare our measurements to predictions from high-resolution, large N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, and find good agreement for the ensemble properties of the sample, and weak to no evolution in the individual absorber properties with redshift. However, we find that the absorbers have an effective radius of b(eff) = 1.2 ± 0.3 physical kpc at z = 2.5, an order of magnitude smaller than predicted from recent results for the relationship between Mg II absorber properties and dark matter halo masses. We argue that this discrepancy may be reconciled by taking into account the effect of feedback and galactic feedback in the simulations, which can significantly reduce the extent of the galaxy halo dark matter envelopes.' We also present weak lensing measurements of the mass distribution in the same field using optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. We find no significant correlations between absorber properties and the positions of individual galaxies, nor of the dark matter halos themselves, nor of the HSC-inferred dark matter distribution. However, we do find that the effective radius of the gas halos measured from absorption are weakly but significantly correlated with the mass of the corresponding dark matter halos; this correlation has been observed previously in simulation, and is consistent with theories of hydrodynamical instability induced by cold, low-density gas accretion onto dark matter halos. Overall, we find good agreement between absorption-based and lensing-based halo mass measurements, suggesting that observed Mg II absorbers likely trace the most highly biased regions of the underlying dark matter distribution, and that further studies of these objects can be used to study structure formation and the circum-galactic medium.",
    "A binary alloy is a chemical mixture of two or more different elements in definite proportions. They are commonly defined as a system with non-overlapping, homogeneous volume fractions occupied by two or more species of elements. Atomic arrangements and compositions lead to different properties. In this paper we study the case where the first species is dimers and the second species is monomers (usually represented by A). We show that upon dimer adsorption at zero temperature, the system undergoes a percolation transition at a specific concentration. This percolation concentration increases when the temperature increases. We argue that this interplay is related to the balance between two processes: i) dimers cover the lattice forming aggregates ii) these aggregates jam increasing the number of sites unfilled. We solve this problem using a functional renormalization group approach, valid for low concentrations of dimers. We compute several critical exponents and discuss the universality classes that the phase diagram belongs to.",
    "Graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms with a remarkable atomic structure, has attracted immense interest recently because of its diverse extraordinary properties, such as extremely high carrier mobility, which leads to the achievement of the record high carrier mobility of ~26,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 in monolayer graphene. One major drawback in the practical applications of graphene is the lack of band gap, which severely restricts its utilization in energy related devices. Traditionally, semiconductors are utilized to manufacture electronic devices such as transistors, solar cells, and LEDs due to the abundance of silicon and the highly effective crystalline structure of silicon based semiconductors. The lack of band gap in graphene has led to investigations into several methods to introduce a band gap in graphene. Recently, it has been theoretically shown that an alternative approach to introduce a band gap in graphene, which is without the need for any external constraint or reagents, is to introduce a periodic potential through modulating the potential landscape on the surface of graphene with an external gate electrode. One such method is to introduce a periodic electric field, which can be achieved through Coulomb drag, where one layer of charge carriers is subjected to an electric field and a second layer of charge carriers is polarized in the opposite direction of the first layer. Coulomb drag has been observed in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in semiconductor systems with the presence of a high concentration of electrons and holes in a material with a band gap, such as GaAs, InAs, or GaN. Therefore, Coulomb drag is a viable approach to introduce a band gap in graphene. In this work, we observe Coulomb Drag in graphene, the first observation of Coulomb Drag in a 2D material system. By growing a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on top of a synthesized graphene monolayer, we can isolate and control the charge carriers in one layer from the other via structural electric field screening. An electric field is then applied between the separated layers and is observed to produce charge separation in the layer subjected to the electric field. This charge separation induces a static polarisation in the other layer via the Kapitza-Dirac effect. The induced static polarisation is observed via capacitance measurements on the separated layers. We observe positive drag, where the charge carrier layer with applied electric field has a higher charge density and negative drag, where the charge carrier layer with polarisation has a lower charge density. Coulomb Drag in graphene is successfully observed for the first time and opens the door to study a material with unique properties such as graphene in a fully tunable bandgap environment, h-BN.",
    "The spectrum of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is typically assumed to follow a power-law, dN/dE = K E-α, where α is the spectral index and K is a normalization constant. One popular mechanism for accelerating cosmic rays to such high energies is the shock acceleration process, where particles scatter back and forth between longitudinal waves until they cross a relativistic shock at which point they attain a non-zero energy corresponding to the jump in the relativistic downstream speed across the shock. Consequently, a popular method for constraining the cosmic-ray power spectrum is by observing the flux ratio of UHECRs above and below the Greizen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. However, such a cutoff is not observed in the flux of UHECRs and its absence has led to the development of possible solutions involving new beyond-Standard-Model physics, such as neutron decaying to electron-antineutrinos. One such beyond-Standard-Model scenario is that cosmic rays are produced via the decay of dark matter particles, which can be motivated by the recent hints for dark matter provided by numerous cosmological, astrophysical and laboratory observations. In this paper we consider the recently proposed model that the dark matter particles are bosons with zero spin, and thus are maximally correlated, and that the decay channel is to standard model particles via a mediation channel involving a real scalar field. We show that under these assumptions the energy in cosmic rays produced via this decay channel cannot explain the observed fluxes above the GZK cutoff. Furthermore, this scenario is excluded by recent observational results from the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array, which are able to detect a flux of UHECRs at Earth with an overall spectral index of 4.6 and a cutoff at around 56 Ee+19 eV. We therefore conclude that this scenario is disfavoured by existing observations.",
    "Recent surveys such as ZENI, POINT-MAD and MOA have been extremely useful in detecting planets around other stars, particularly super earths and Neptune mass planets. A very interesting aspect of these surveys has been the use of the gravitational microlensing effect to search for planets around other stars. Microlensing occurs when a star passes in front of an object such as a star or a star system and the light of the background star is affected by the passage of the foreground object. If a planet is passing in front of the background star, the planet will exert a small but significant gravitational force on the light of the background star and this will cause a deviation from the straight line trajectory of the light path. The angular separation of the background and foreground objects as well as the time scale of the event are determine by the size of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. These surveys have used the observations of lensing events to search for planets with a wide range of masses and distances from the host star. These surveys have also been successful in detecting planets that are at the same distance from their star as the Earth is from the Sun, i.e. between 0.01 and 1 AU. This in turn has lead to the development of new strategies for the direct imaging of planets. The results of these surveys have led to the detection of planets around a wide range of host stars including red dwarf stars which are common in the galaxy but have very low masses and small radii. Planets play an important role in the evolution of systems including our own Solar System. The detection of planets outside of our Solar System and in other solar systems allows us to determine the distribution of planets as a function of distance from their star and also the characteristics of the planet. In this paper we review the results of these surveys and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the microlensing method for detecting planets.",
    "Personal archives hold a unique record of our lives and experiences. Often these collections are a mix of mementos, documents, and computer files that reflect different points in time and generate from different applications or sources. Providing a seamless and secure experience for the user has been a key challenge for archival service providers. In this paper, we propose a service model for personal archives that is complementary to existing cloud and backup offerings. In our model, users retain ownership and control of their data, and service providers offer access to files based on established security criteria. In return, users are paid for the services they use. In this way, service providers can utilize data while allowing users to monetize their assets, benefitting both parties. To demonstrate our approach, we have integrated with a File-hosting service to provide access to a sample of user files. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that users are able to access their data quickly and securely through this interface, with the service generating significant revenue for the host. We also discuss key considerations and challenges for this model, and highlight opportunities to further integrate with security services, enable access via Web browsers, and promote user privacy. This work was sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Technology & Public Policy (IATP) at George Mason University. The digital assets of individuals are growing increasingly large in volume and diverse in source and type, including documents, images, videos, and computational artifacts created by individuals and their interacting with digital systems. Many individuals would like to ensure the availability and accessibility of their digital assets into the future, and would prefer to monetize their use of these assets while they are still accessible. A challenge for service providers is to assist individuals in meeting these goals while maintaining the privacy and security of the data and providing a sustainable business model. We present a model that enables individuals to own and monetize their data while providing a seamless, secure experience for the user. Service providers will be able to access data while meeting security criteria established by the user, and users can generate revenue for the services they use. We present our approach to integrating with a cloud storage service to demonstrate the compatibility and security of this model. We also discuss additional considerations necessary for fully integrating with security services and show preliminary revenue results. We conclude by discussing the potential challenges and opportunities for this model and identify next steps to address these challenges and develop this idea into a sustainable business. Personal archives, like those of Alan Turing or Edward Snowden, provide a unique perspective on current affairs. The long-term accessibility and security of these collections is increasingly a concern. Encryption methods improve annually, but remain cumbersome to use and are vulnerable to motivated or unknowledgeable attackers. In addition, the quantity and variety of digital assets generated by individuals grows increasingly large and complex. Personal archives must adopt a user-centric approach that allows owners to control their data and ensure its accessibility while meeting the unique needs of each archive. These assets should be monetized while available, and security",
    "Nova explosions are powered by the rapid conversion of hydrogen to helium via the pp chain. The reaction rates in simulations are set by fitting to experimental data from the sun, but how well do these rates represent nova explosions, which can occur in a vastly different environment? I find that changes in these rates can alter the amount of explosive hydrogen produced, the amount of fallback, and the amount of radioactive nickel synthesized. In some cases, the nova fails to explode at all. The rates may need to be adjusted to better represent nova explosions, and I propose a simple method to do so. I also analyze how the explosion dynamics are affected by the chosen reaction rates. Increasing the hydrogen reaction rate too much increases the amount of explosive hydrogen produced and thus the strength of the explosion. In contrast, decreasing the hydrogen reaction rate too much decreases the amount of explosive hydrogen produced. Decreasing the hydrogen reaction rate too much leads to weak explosions that do not achieve nuclear statistical equilibrium. Examining these rates reveals that there is an optimal hydrogen reaction rate that results in a good explosion with the correct amount of explosive hydrogen, amount of fallback, and amount of radioactive nickel.",
    "We present an analytical model for the self-similar scaling relations between the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal and the physical properties of the astrophysical systems they are derived from. The model considers the projection effect in the spatial structure of the systems and takes into account the hydrostatic bias caused by the luminous or total mass distribution. We apply our model to interpret the SZ profiles obtained with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and show that the ACT-derived SZ surface brightness profiles can be well fitted by the self-similar form if certain scaling relations are imposed. We also show that there are systematics in the SZ measurements due to the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beam-smoothing effect and propose an empirical method to reduce these systematics. We test our method on numerical simulations and show that the self-similar scaling relations can be violated if the hydrostatic bias is not properly taken into account. We apply our model to the Horizon-AGN simulation and demonstrate that the typical magnitude of the violation of the scaling relations is around 40%. We also show that the amplitude of the scaling relations can be used to measure the bias factor between the total mass and the gas mass, which can be used to calibrate the flux bias correction for SZ effect. All the scaling relations obtained with our model are independent of the cosmological model, which can be used to put robust cosmological constraints with SZ effect data.",
    "The high energy emission of GRO J1655-40 as revealed with INTEGRAL spectroscopy of the 2005 outburst is described. This well-known black hole X-ray binary is a system composed of a Neutron Star primary orbiting a black hole of 18 Meters in close orbit (13-31 R_s) every 2.87 hours. It is suspected that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as evidenced by its spectral class of Z-source, which is characterized by having strong, sometimes regular, neutron star high-speed winds. These winds are likely due to the transfer of energy from the accretion disk onto the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was detected with the INTEGRAL observatory on Jan. 28, 2005, and reached a maximum on Feb. 24. The work presented here focuses on the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 over this time period. The major result of this work is the discovery of acutoff powerlaw component in the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, with a flux contribution of approximately 50% over nearly 3 decades in energy. This component is not commonly observed in X-ray binaries, and therefore its discovery with INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high energy production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the accretion disk blackbody component which is often seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and is generally thought to be the signature ofNETWORK GAMMA RAYS radiated by the inner part of an accretion disk around a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a neutron star at its core, represents a new paradigm for high energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, and may indicate that disk accretion is not the only form of high energy production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is the result of a new form of high energy production unique to this system, which may be a result of the strong neutron star winds. This may be a promising area for exploration with further, more detailed analysis of these data.",

    "In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum (AM) and linear momentum (PM) operators have a spectrum of eigenvalues that is far more extensive than that allowed by classical Physics. For example, the eigenvalues of the square of the total AM operator in a given quantum mechanical state are proportional to the total nuclear spin, a property with theoretically unlimited resolution. In addition, the eigenvalues of the square of the total linear momentum operator in a given quantum mechanical state are equal to the square of the reciprocal of the reduced Planck's constant, a physically observable property with theoretically unlimited precision. Since these quantities are numerically equal to, respectively, the total AM and total PM of the quantum state, this work concludes that quantum mechanics does in fact adhere to the AM and PM properties expected from classical Physics. These extraordinary results are the consequence of rigorous mathematical theorems from the field of Quantum Mechanics, which state that the eigenvalues of these operators are theoretically unbounded. Classical Physics would suggest that the values of these operators be limited by the product of the reduced Planck's constant and the corresponding spatial dimension of the system. The eigenvalues of the square of the total AM operator in a given quantum mechanical state are equal to the square of the reciprocal of the reduced Planck's constant, a physically observable property with theoretically unlimited precision. Since these quantities are numerically equal to, respectively, the total AM and total PM of the quantum state, this work concludes that quantum mechanics does in fact adhere to the AM and PM properties expected from classical Physics. Similarly, the expectation value of the square of the total angular momentum operator in a given quantum mechanical state is equal to the reduced nuclear spin of the quantum state, a property that theoretically has no upper limit. Furthermore, the expectation value of the square of the total linear momentum operator in a given quantum mechanical state is equal to the reduced Planck's constant, a physically observable property with theoretically unlimited precision.

    "In this study, the dust distribution in edge-on galaxies is analyzed using data from radiative transfer fits of V and K'-band images. We find that the relative distributions of stars and dust follow a approximately lognormal distribution. The lognormal shape of the dust distribution is consistent with that of the distribution of dust emission in our own Galaxy, and provides an empirical relation between the total amount of dust and the ratio of dust to stellar light in a galaxy. We show that this relation is independent of the radial dependence of the ratio of dust to stellar light, and hence provides a simple method for estimating the total amount of dust in a galaxy. We also find that the scale height of dust is smaller than that of stars, and that the dust scale height decreases with increasing distance from the mid-plane of the galaxy. The radial dependence of the dust scale height is consistent with that predicted by simple models of dust distribution in galactic disks. Finally, we find that the dust-to-stellar-light ratio increases with increasing absolute magnitude of the galaxy.",
    "In this work we consider a generalization of classical repeated games, called asynchronous games. In an asynchronous game, there is no requirement that the players observe the history of past actions, but rather each player’s action only depends on the current state and the current action of the player. Asynchronous games allow for more general interactive strategies than their classical synchronous counterparts. One setting that has been studied extensively is that of mixed-motive, or Hawk-Dove, games. Here, one player (the Hawk) can choose to do nothing, and the other player (the Dove) must decide between two actions. In this case, it has been established that mixed strategies are optimal for the Dove, i.e. the Always Defect policy is a Nash equilibrium. Here we introduce a game in which there is only a single player, and the player can choose to do nothing, participate in the game, or switch between these two actions infinitely often. We show that such a player has an almost sure optimal strategy, i.e. that they will play a best-response against any strategy that the opposite player may employ. We also show that there is an initial profile for which the payoff of the first-player is strictly less than that of the second-player. In particular, this implies that the first-player has an optimal almost-sure strategy in this initial profile. We believe this example to be of independent interest, as it shows that a.s. optimality can be achieved without the requirement of alternation of plays.",
    "Coleman and De Luccia showed that nontrivial topologies with nontrivial first homotopy group allow for Euclidean wormholes. This method of traversing the wormhole requires that the Euclidean path integral be performed across the wormhole, with the traversal switched on at the end of theColeman and De Luccia showed that nontrivial topologies with nontrivial first homotopy group allow for Euclidean wormholes. This method of traversing the wormhole requires that the Euclidean path integral be performed across the wormhole, with the traversal switched on at the end of the wormhole and switched off at the end of the Euclidean universe. Here I demonstrate that the Euclidean path integral may be performed without reference to a global Euclidean metric, but rather based on a local thermal energy density. Because the Euclidean wormhole instanton is based on local thermal energy, the traversal of the wormhole may occur at any point along the wormhole without concern for global temperature or topology, and the traversal need only be switched on at one end of the wormhole to be complete. This allows for tunneling from one topology to another without reference to a global Euclidean metric. This new version of Euclidean wormholes is also applicable to Lorentzian spacetimes, and so Euclidean wormholes with nontrivial first homotopy group may now allow for traversal from one Lorentzian universe to another without violation of the Coleman-Herman uniqueness theorem.",

The former is indicated by an X-ray luminosity non-detection, while the latter is visible in the X-ray band as a galaxy cluster. The ESO137-001 subgroup is located in the middle of the plane of the sky between the two main clusters. The ESO137-001 galaxy subgroup contains two H-II regions with sizes of 10 and 15 kpc which are ionised by an evolved, low-mass star cluster. They are also associated with extended H-alpha emission and excess blue light. The star-formation rate in the H-II regions is 2-3 × 10−2 M☉ yr−1. It is likely that the H-II regions have been recently ionised by a series of star clusters with typical ages of 1-3 Myr, too small to detect individually in current observations. The total star-formation rate in the ESO137-001 galaxy subgroup is 1-2 M☉. The estimated contribution of this to the hot gas mass in the cluster is 20-30%. The X-ray luminosity of the cluster is thus mostly created by non-ionising stellar emission. The subgroup is located at the projected crossing point of the two infall regions of the main clusters, so the fraction of recent merging activity might be higher than in the average cluster.",
    "We further our study of closed string field theory on quintic Calabi-Yau hypersurface. By analyzing the one-loop moduli space approximation, we first present the generic structure of marginal deformations, and propose the first-order effective action. Next, we apply our results to study the discrete states in thetheory. We first present the explicit form of wave-functions on the basis of recent works. Then, we show that there exists a hidden symmetry in the theory, and derive the corresponding constraints on the interaction vertices. Together with the one-loop result, our result provides a complete description of the discrete states at quartic order. This work was done in collaboration with Hitoshi Nishino and Shota Komatsu. Closed bosonic string field theory around the stable solution of quintic Calabi-Yau is studied at cubic and quartic order in this work. Generically, the theory contains marginal deformations and their corresponding first-order effective action. By studying the discrete states, we first present the explicit form of wave-functions on the basis of recent works. Then, we show that there exists a hidden symmetry in the theory, and derive the corresponding constraints on the interaction vertices. In particular, we show that there exist discrete states at cubic order and at quartic order respectively.",
    "The dewetting of thin liquid films on solid surfaces is an interesting process due to its strong influences on heat and mass transfer, as well as surface chemistry. Because of this, dewetting has been studied for many years in both the academic and industrial arenas. Dewetting has been shown to be generically irreversible and governed by dynamical evolution equations for the height of the film and the contact angle at the edge of the droplet. When the contact line moves, it leaves a behind a thin \"foot\" of liquid, which can act to stabilise the drop by keeping it in equilibrium. However, if the contact line is slowed, and/or the fluid is sufficiently viscous, the foot can thicken, and eventually become unstable to further motions. In the first part of this study, we observed that for dewetting drops on hydrophobic surfaces, it was possible to stabilise the foot at constant volume (with variations in temperature and viscosity) via an oscillatory relaxation mode, which has previously been observed by other groups. Here we present experimental evidence for this relaxation mode, and explore its dependency on viscosity, temperature, and the apparent contact angle.",
    "The absorption spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been the subject of intense study owing to their potential uses in diverse applications ranging from chemical sensors to transistors. While broadband techniques such as transmission spectroscopy have been used to study these CNTs, they are difficult to use to determine the size, shape, and structure of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Here, we report a polarization-resolved absorption spectroscopy study of single semiconducting (8, 8) SWCNTs at room temperature. We simultaneously characterize the excitonic fine structure and excitonic couplings of the SWCNTs using polarization-selective detection. We observe discrete excitonic states, which we assign to the Λ- and Σ-configurations of the SWCNTs. The average exciton splitting is 2.2 meV, which we assign to π-π stacking interaction. We observe slight angular dependence of the excitonic fine structure, which we attribute to the radial confinement of the excitons. Additionally, we observe a hyperfine interaction of approximately 25 meV between the nanotube's basal plane and the Nuclear Spin of the Carbon atoms. This hyperfine interaction is several orders of magnitude larger than that in conventional semiconductor quantum dots and semiconducting SWCNTs studied previously. The hyperfine interaction may be a result of the underlying atomic structure of the SWCNTs, which includes four strongly chemisorbed polar graphitic rings per nanotube.",
    "We derive entropy inequalities for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the perfect gas. The lattice Boltzmann equation is a popular discretization of the continuum Boltzmann equation for rarefied gases, and provides a simple algorithm for computing Navier-Stokes-like moments. However, the Chapman-Enskog analysis of the LBM demonstrates that it provides no cooling, an entropy mistake first identified by Zhou et al. [J. Stat. Phys. 165, 1 (2016)]. Our first result is an upper bound on the heat flux in LBM conserved moments. We then prove a discrete entropy inequality using entropy Corrigan relationships and monotonicity properties of the discrete chain velocity. We show that this discrete entropy inequality is satisfied by LBM conserved moments provided that the solution has at least second order accuracy in space and time. We present LBM discretizations that satisfy the discrete entropy inequality with first and second order accuracy in space and time. Numerical evidence demonstrates the practicality of our entropy corrector LBM schemes, in that they yield statistically accurate solutions to the fluctuating viscous compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three spatial dimensions.",
    "In this work, we study analog neural networks with temporally fluctuating synaptic weights, i.e. a noisy neural network. Such noise may model the effect of random mutations in molecules and can significantly improve the performance of the network. We employ the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach to derive the phase diagram of such a noisy neural network. Depending on the number of weight and input noise realizations, the system is in the synchronized state, where all neurons share the same output, or in the desynchronized state. In the latter case, the outputs of individual neurons are independent. We also consider the case when the individual weight and input noise are zero, which corresponds to a purely analog neural network. We find that even in this case, the presence of weight noise improves the ability of the network to discriminate between different patterns. In particular, it facilitates the separation of closely related patterns and prevents overfitting.",
    "Observed spectra of black hole may consist of multiple components, one of which is the thermal component. We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",
    "A fundamental problem in machine learning is to cluster data such that the within-cluster data points are similar to each other and the between-cluster data points are as different as possible. Correlation clustering (CC) is one of the most popular and successful methods for this task, which can be efficiently solved by convex relaxations and proven to recover the optimal solution under certain conditions. However, these conditions are difficult to satisfy in practice, leading to a rapid growing literature to understand the relationship between convergence rate and parameters, and the pervasiveness of correlation clustering in a variety of domains. In this paper, we argue that correlation clustering is inapproximable within any constant factor, based on the observation that it can easily get stuck in local optima and the problem's correlated nature. This inapproximability result holds for a large family of differentiable relaxations, and we present a specific algorithm to capture the core difficulty of the problem. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data sets, and the results confirm our analysis, strongly suggesting that correlation clustering is indeed an NP-hard problem.",
    "The deuteron electrodisintegration threshold cross section is one of the main doorway to study the interaction between the electromagnetic and the nuclear field. This process has been studied in the past at low and intermediate energies with various models and limited precision. In recent years the availability of powerful numerical methods to solve relativistic quantum mechanical problems allowed for the first time to perform calculations at higher energies, approaching the deuteron breakup threshold. We present here a simple approach to the calculation of the process at relativistic energies based on a distorted wave Born approximation. The formalism is applied to study the process at a laboratory energy of 1.2 GeV, which is relevant for the creation of hot dense matter in current and future accelerator facilities. We find good agreement with previous results from optical models and the expected deviation from them at backward angles. The manuscript is partly based on a talk presented at the INT workshop “Electroweak Astrophysics and Fundamental Interactions” (September 2024).",
    "The mass of a planet is one of the most fundamental characteristics of a planet. Planets are classified as either'super-Earths' or 'gas giant planets' based on their sizes and compositions. Gas giant planets are made of hydrogen and helium, in addition to other light chemical elements. The standard model to explain their compositions postulates that they attained their gaseous state after developing cores of rock and metal through the process of core accretion. This standard model, however, has significant problems in explaining the masses of a large number of exoplanets whose host stars have very similar characteristics to the Sun. In particular, the distribution of exoplanets with initial orbits near their host stars and those with initial orbits farther out, do not show the expected division between super-Earths and gas giant planets. This discrepancy, termed the inward migration problem, has led to the proposal of different solutions. In one proposed solution, planets in the early stages of evolution are pulled towards their host stars by the angular momentum of forming gas disks. If a forming planet's initial orbit is sufficiently near its host star, the planet's gravity is able to clear its initial gas disk. However, this early phase of migration, dubbed 'Type II migration', leaves an imprint on the planet's final mass. Planet migration and structure are intimately related. Thus, understanding the early phases of migration is important for understanding planet structures as they evolve. In this study, I present the results of a large number of Type II migration simulations designed to examine how the early phases of migration affect a planet's structure at the end of the migration process. The formation locations of the planets span the range from near their host stars to those that are far from their host stars. The mass ratios of the planets span a wide range from 0.1 to 10. By comparing the migration rates and structures, I found that the initial positions of planets do have an effect on the mass of the planets. Planets that started close to their host stars, but migrated farther out, end up as low mass super-Earths, while planets that started further away from their host stars ended up as gas giant planets. I propose that this dichotomy in final masses is a result of the dynamical effects of multiple interacting Lindblad resonances, that form during the early phases of migration. The extent to which a planet stirs up particles in a disk is proportional to its Hill radius, which is also the distance at which a planet's gravitational force penetrates into the disk. Lindblad resonances, the locations where a planet's Hill radius is equal to the radial separation of adjacent disk particles, occur at separations of almost two-thirds and one-half of the planet's Hill radius. In most cases, Lindblad resonances form first between the planets and the particles in the disk residing at the same locations. These interactions stir up additional particles in the disk, increasing the scale height of the disk at those locations. Because the planets' gravitational force",
    "Galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy formation model with SPITZER data. In a hierarchical model of structure formation, galaxies form by the coagulation of lower mass systems. The process is modelled using the semi-analytic code [galform]{} which follows the formation and merger histories of dark matter haloes and subhaloes. The model generates realistic present-day galaxy populations in both field and group environments and successfully reproduces the basic demographics of galaxies in several classes, including spheroids, disks and active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we test the model against Herschel/SPIRE observations of the infra-red galaxy population, using far-infrared and submillimetre wavelengths as a measure of the star-formation rate (SFR). We find that the model is able to reproduce the SPIRE counts and the distribution of fluxes with surface density at bright flux levels, but overpredicts the number of bright sources at low surface density. At intermediate flux densities, the model does a good job of reproducing the shape of the distribution but underpredicts the number of sources by a factor of 2-3. We explore several potential causes of this discrepancy, but find that most of them are insufficient to explain the factor of 2-3 difference in flux density. A plausible cause we suggest is the inclusion in the code of spheroids but not of starbursts in the cool core/mantle of cluster galaxies; this neglect was motivated by a lack of observational evidence at the time. Including starbursts in the model but not in the luminosity function leads to a very good match to the observations. The code [galform]{} is available in its current form from http://galform.mpastorff.de.",
    "The QEL, which stands for Quasi-Elastic scence, is a inelastic interaction of neutrino which induces a smaller nuclear excitation. The fully contained events and partially contained events are two main categories of neutrino interaction types that detected in the Super-Kamiokande. By using the electron number-density profile of the Near Detector, we find the QEL can explain the fully contained events, while it can not explain the partially contained events. Therefore we can conclude that the neutrino direction is reliable for the fully contained events but not for the partially contained events.

    "Galaxy clusters are massive aggregations of galaxies. Their shapes, orientations, and spatial distributions provide powerful cosmological constraints. We investigate the intrinsic shapes and orientations of the dark matter halos that host galaxy clusters. The dynamical shapes and orientations of the clusters are the product of the intrinsic shapes of their member galaxies and the cluster-cluster shape and orientation correlations induced by gravitational interactions. We measure the projected shapes, orientations, and correlations of the host dark matter halos using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and integral field units from Mapping Nearby Galaxies with APOGEE (MaNGA). We find that the projected shapes of the host halos are consistent with spherical expectation, but exhibit significant alignment between the major and intermediate axes of the clusters and their dark matter hosting halos. The orientations of the clusters are consistent with being randomly oriented in space, but exhibit significant alignment with the major axes of their halos. The strength of this alignment increases with the relative projected mass of the cluster. The alignment between the cluster and halo shapes and orientations is stronger for more massive clusters, and the alignment between the cluster orientation and the major axis of the halo weakens with increasing redshift. The orientation-major axis alignment can be produced by rare, major mergers between clusters with similar mass, but prograde, lead-following alignments between the cluster orientation and the major axis of the progenitor of the leading cluster are produced by more frequent, retrograde mergers between clusters with different mass. A shared orientation between the cluster and progenitor major axis indicates a recent merger. We discuss possible physical origins for the correlations between the cluster and halo shapes and orientations, as well as implications for the relation between clusters and their large-scale structure, in light of our results and recent galaxy-galaxy merger simulations.",
    "A High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) Scorpius X-1 is a system containing a compact object (neutron star or a black hole) that regularly ejects material from its companion star. This system is classified as an Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) with a spin period of 12.31s and an inferred surface dipole magnetic field strength of 3.2√{5}-4.2×√{5}×B, where B is the star's surface dipole magnetic field strength in Tesla. Recent studies show that Sco X-1 spends most of its life in the so called island state in the color-color diagram, corresponding to a stable cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the soft X-ray spectrum. In this state, the object's spectrum is dominated by the thermal component from the neutron star's photosphere as well as a cyclotron resonance scattering component (CRC) from a corona of relativistic electrons. Here we present new high-statistics broad-band spectra of Sco X-1 covering its complete color-color evolution from island to banana states. We find that along this evolution the relative contribution of the CRC varies from nearly 40% in the island state to less than 10% in the banana state. Furthermore, the fraction of the non-thermal component in the CRC decreases with increasing color distance from the island to the banana. These results suggest that the mechanism for producing the CRC changes along the color-color evolution from island to banana states.",
    "We present the discovery of fifteen new low-mass companions to planet host stars, using data from the squeezernigton component of the high-contrast imaging instrument GPI. These new planets raise the total count of imaged planets to thirty-eight, and the total number of planet host stars to twelve. Most of the new discoveries are super-Earth sized planets, with sizes ranging from 1.3 to 5.7 Earth radii, and masses from 2 to 20 Earth masses. Two of the planets have very high equilibrium temperatures, and may be classified as Hot Neptunes. Twelve of the new planets were detected in direct imaging, and fifteen come from high density Bonner Powell modeling of the trajectory of planets observed with GPI. We also update the orbital properties for twelve of the planets, including eight that are likely in multiple systems. We also compare the properties of planet host stars to those of similar stars without detected planets, and find that planet host stars are more likely to have a higher metallicity and exhibit smaller spin rates.",
    "A population of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshift ~ 4.5 was found to form over-densities by narrow-band Lyman alpha imaging, a sign of ongoing galaxy formation at early times. Subsequent spectroscopy of these over-densities revealed lower redshifts (~ 4.5), though, for the most part, the LAEs were observed to remain at z ~ 4.5. This apparent clustering was confirmed with numerical simulations and interpreted as evidence for the existence of substantial neutral hydrogen reserves in these early systems. Itai M. R惠and Andrea G。Crocce led a team that used imaging with the UltraVio survey to find this clustering and confirmed it with subsequent spectroscopic observations. The study is published in the journal Science. UltraVio (University of Vienna Observatory), an imaging survey using the robotic 2.2m telescope of the University of Vienna, is described at http://www.ifs.org.ua/usno/auto/auto.htm. The survey imaged eight square degrees of the sky in five passbands between 4000 and 9000 Å. The observations, from 2011 to 2016, were made with a wide-field camera designed by the University of Vienna and equipped with a InSb detector with a pixel size of 18 μm, covering a field of view of 1.76° × 1.76°. The survey is 95% complete to DM = 24.7. The data are available from the University of Vienna Science Archive (URL: http://tagc.ifac.tuwien.ac.at/ultravio/).",
    "A single letter from the input bit stream can imply multiple output symbols, achieving maximum diversity in a collection of outputs. For any monotonic, right-continuous input distribution, the associated optimal output distribution has a combinatorially simple form. This universal source coder can be implemented efficiently, with computation and feedback per letter logarithmic in the length of the codeword. The corresponding maximum likelihood decoder is fast and approximately maximum a posteriori, for all realizable input distributions. We present evidence of the effectiveness of this coding strategy through empirical evaluation on synthetic and real datasets. This letter studies the problem of coding for an abstract alphabet, maximizing the entropy of an output sequence subject to an average cost per bit. We show that for any right-continuous, monotonic input distribution, there exists an output distribution achieving these costs, whose support can be described by a small, regular graph. We present efficient algorithms to generate codes for such distributions, with computation and feedback both logarithmic in the length of the codeword. We evaluate our scheme empirically on synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate that our codes achieve low cost per bit while incurring little redundancy.",
    "A new semi-empirical pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) equation of state (EOS) is developed for MgSiO3 perovskite, an important material for planets in the inner solar system. A major difficulty in developing an accurate EOS for this material, which has a Curie temperature and becomes superionic at high pressures, is the omission of temperature-dependent terms in standard EOS formulations. To overcome this, an existing mapping procedure is used to develop an equation of state suitable for use at high temperature (up to 1500 K) and low pressures (down to 10-3 bar), using tabular data for the high-temperature parts of the equation of state. This is then connected to another mapping procedure, which is accurate from 10-3 bar to 1 TPa, using a two-segment fit to first-principles molecular dynamics data for the intermediate pressure range. The final EOS is tested against several validation datasets with encouraging results, and comparisons with state-of-the-art 1TPa EOSs are made. The EOS is made available online for use within the planetary community.",
    "Using observations from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope, we have detected gamma-rays from 37 supernova remnants (SNRs). The gamma-rays are dominated by hadrons, with a smaller component from bremsstrahlung. The observed gamma-ray spectra are well fitted by a single power-law in kinetic energy, with indices between 2.0 and 2.7. The gamma-ray efficiency, the fraction of supernova explosion energy deposited in the form of gamma-rays, is about 1% for young SNRs and increases with age as the amount of shocked gas increases. Hadronic gamma-ray production rates are a few percent of the historical yields, suggesting that cosmic-ray particles propagate through a dense medium with relatively mild interactions. We conclude that the observed gamma-rays are consistent with production in nuclei interactions with background protons, although uncertainties in the local cosmic-ray density and composition are large enough to allow significant contributions from electrons and Dark Matter particles. The detection of gamma-rays from young and middle-aged SNRs without corresponding radio synchrotron emission challenges existing models of gamma-ray production in SNRs.",
    "Modern online services, such as image and video hosting services, have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. These services often allow users to tag images with keyword or category labels. Such keyword or category labels are often expensive to acquire and very skewed. For example, most images contain people and outdoor scenes, and the category “people” and “outdoor” respectively have many highly-used tags. It is desirable to infer the likely categories of unlabeled images from the keyword or category tags already assigned to them. This problem of tag auto-labeling has many important applications. For example, a service could suggest labels to unlabeled images based on their metadata and content. Moreover, users could contribute more meaningful labels to images that they judge contain specific categories. Existing approaches to this problem of tag auto-labeling mainly exploit the local label semantics. However, the inferred semantics often do not match the global label semantics. For example, images of people often contain backgrounds with trees or buildings, and these global semantics are often unrelated to the local “people” category. These methods often resort to spectral clustering or other local optimization techniques that can only handle relatively small tag vocabularies. They often need large amounts of training data and suffers from data sparsity. In this paper, we analyze the global attentional shift of users while browsing image tags. By measuring global attentional shift, we can use computer vision techniques to automatically infer the global label semantics, and this global inference can alleviate the problems caused by local label semantics. More importantly, the inferred global label semantics often match the human semantics, which further justifies the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our algorithm has two stages. The first stage tracks the global attentional shift of users based on tracking clicks on the server. We first estimate the bounding boxes of the user heads and record the clicks on tags within these boxes. Next, we identify the regions of interest (ROIs) by grouping the clicked boxes with a relatively high density. We then determine the global attentional shift by measuring the density of the boxes in the ROIs. The second stage infers the label semantics from the global attentional shift. For each image, we first find the most similar images in the training set using a deep network based on the learned representations. By combining the global attentional shift and local semantic information, we can infer the global label semantics. We finally use a straightforward optimization algorithm to learn the global label semantics. Our algorithm tracks both local and global attentional shift. It can accurately identify the regions of user interests and can also model the global attentional shift between different regions. By combining both local and global information, we can accurately infer the label semantics and thus automatically auto-label unlabeled images. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of both tagging accuracy and efficiency. Our algorithm has two stages. The first stage tracks the global attentional shift of users",
    "The Lorentz transformations form a group that shows how the laws of physics change when things move at constant speed. A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",
    "Neutralinos could be a major component of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. Many well-known SUSY GUTs suggest that the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is a good candidate for neutralino, and a DM candidate. However, such SUSY GUTs often have difficulties in matching the measured values of the gauge couplings at the GUT scale, or have to make ad hoc assumptions to explain this. We propose that these difficulties can be avoided if the SUSY is broken in a hidden sector and mediated to the observable sector through strong SUSY breaking effects mediated by scalar supersymmetric partners of standard model fields. In this framework, the SUSY GUTs with a good GUT unification prediction for the strong coupling can naturally give rise to a light neutralino as the LSP which is a good DM candidate. In addition, we show that the correct value for the weak mixing angle can also be obtained. Moreover, we provide one concrete realisation of this framework in which the lightest scalar partner of the standard model Higgs field is the LSP and therefore also a good candidate for DM. This provides a very predictive DM framework which can be tested in the near future both at colliders and at indirect detection experiments such as Cherenkov telescopes.",
    "A description of a path integral approach for the dynamics of a random chain with constraints is presented. The constraints can be viewed as accounting for the fact that the bonds of the chain are “rigid”: the left and right hand sides of each bond are identically fixed. This fixed-bond disorder is introduced into a standard version of the zero-temperature transition point of a Hamiltonian system of equations for the Cartesian components of the chain’s end-to-end vector. The fixed-bond disorder is assumed to be Gaussian and the properties of the resulting random chain are examined in the limit of infinite spatial dimension. The resulting propagator can be computed analytically, and is found to lead to a radically altered scaling of various physical quantities with the chain’s length. In particular, the end-to-end distance scales as a positive power of the length instead of being logarithmically correlated. An interpretation of this result in terms of effective surface tension induced by the fixed bond disorder is proposed, and a simple approximation for the propagator is derived using a small-argument approximation for the inverse of the Green’s function of the constrained chain. The accuracy of the propagator obtained in this way is tested by means of a quantitative comparison with numerical simulations.",
    "We report the detection of six magnetically-driven explosions of rapidly-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) following accretion-induced collapse. The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA's Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions. We also determined the probable locations of the progenitor stars by cross-referencing our sample to Gaia Data Release 2 and found that four of the exploding WDs had most likely been observed in the field of view of their respective host galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs are more likely to be detectable from their host galaxies than explosions from low-mass WDs. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic fields have a critical impact on the explosion mechanisms and outcomes from this astrophysical scenario and that such explosions are a promising avenue for the retention of mass in rapidly-rotating WDs. We report the detection of six exploding white",
    "One of the surprising results from the early phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was the discovery of a population of close galaxy pairs, showing a substantial population of \"asymmetric\" galaxies (those with morphological disturbances). Given the apparent prominence of these disturbances in gas-rich galaxies, it has been hypothesized that the asymmetry observed could be associated with recent or ongoing galaxy mergers. In this paper, we test this hypothesis using a sample of 106 close pairs from the Million galaxy catalogue. We find that the close pairs show significant evidence of having undergone a recent merger, with the fraction of galaxies showing such disturbances correlating strongly with their separation. For separations of less than 5Mpc, 65% of galaxies show some form of disturbance (typically distorted isophotes and/or asymmetries), compared to only 29% for larger separations. The disturbed fraction for close pairs is consistent with that seen in strong lensing studies of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and suggests that the disturbance signal is not induced by the tidal forces experienced in mergers. Based on these results, we present a revised merger history for the Universe, finding a substantial increase in the merger rate at low redshift. We suggest that this high merger rate, and the accompanying perturbations in the dark matter potential, may help to explain the spatial distribution of galaxies in larger scale cosmological N-body simulations.",
    "In this paper, we propose and implement a method to control a flashing ratchet by using time-delayed feedback. In contrast to most previous realizations of flashing ratchets, our ratchet is fully deterministic, in the sense that all the particles of the ratchet follow the same trajectories. This is achieved using near-concentric circular tracks on which the particles, confined by a harmonic potential, undergo small amplitude fluctuations. These fluctuations are counteracted by a periodic modulation of the harmonic potential, causing the particles to perform small circular orbits with a superimposed motion along the circumference. By appropriately choosing the frequency and amplitude of these additional motions, we can arrange for a given particle to switch between a clockwise and a counterclockwise orbit with a time delay. In this way, we can implement control protocols that are formally equivalent to traditional feedback control systems. We analyze our ratchet both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical analysis provides design guidelines for the system parameters, while the experimental analysis verifies the expected equations of motion as well as the ability of the system to implement a variety of more complicated control protocols.",
    "A short abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. The article explores the X-ray properties of V2301 Oph, a binary system composed of a late-type main-sequence star and an unseen, highly magnetized hot-Jupiter exoplanet in a highly eccentric orbit. The X-rays are generated in the stellar magnetosphere, which is distorted by the planet's gravity. The distortion causes cyclotron resonance scattering of X-rays in the planet's magnetosphere, resulting in the appearance of a dark spot on the visible hemisphere and a bright spot on the other hemisphere of the planet. The observations were carried out in 2013 using the XMM-Newton observatory. The results confirm that the planet possesses a massive and highly magnetized magnetosphere, and that the global atmosphere of the planet is strongly dominated by molecular hydrogen. The article is accompanied by 8 high resolution figures and 1 table. The figures show the temporal and spatial variability of the X-ray flux, as well as distribution of elemental abundances. The table provides planet and star parameters, and a summary of the results.",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary computation (EC) are powerful and popular techniques that are broadly used to address complex optimization problems. Although traditionally thought of as distinct approaches, in this work we show that by carefully blending them, both global convergence speed and practicality can be greatly improved. More specifically, we develop a novel hybridization called evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL), which seamlessly integrates the key ideas behind RL and EC, leading to accelerated convergence, and better stability and diversity of the obtained solutions. Our approach is general and can be applied to a broad spectrum of problems that are difficult to solve by conventional techniques. We demonstrate this on several benchmark problems, including classical problem instances from the literature as well as new ones designed to highlight the versatility of the approach. Finally, we also test our approach on complex network dynamics problems, and show that it is highly effective in helping the system converge to better solutions with a much lower computation cost."
