    "We study vacuum energy in quantum field theory with boundary conditions that break conformal invariance, such as Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show how to renormalize this quantity using zeta function regularization techniques. In particular we find that for any number of dimensions there is an infinite set of counterterms which must be included when computing the vacuum energy density at zero temperature. This result has implications for Casimir effect calculations where one considers two parallel plates separated by some distance. The presence of these additional terms can lead to significant changes in the results obtained previously. Finally we consider the case of fermions coupled to scalar fields and compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. For certain values of the coupling constant it turns out that the vacuum state becomes unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Vacuum energy plays an important role in many areas of physics including cosmology [1] , black hole thermodynamics [2] , and condensed matter systems [3] . It also appears in various contexts within string theory [4] .\nIn recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the nature of vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theories (QFTs) [5] - [8] . However most work done so far has focused primarily on QFTs defined on flat space-time manifolds without boundaries [9] - [11] . Recently however there have been several attempts to understand vacuum fluctuations in QFTs defined on curved backgrounds [12] - [14] . Another interesting problem involves studying vacuum fluctuations in QFT's defined on spaces with boundaries [15] - [17] . Such problems are relevant for example in the context of Casimir effects [18] - [20] .",
    "We present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of radio galaxies in clusters at redshifts z=0.4-0.8, carried out with the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). We find that the fraction of AGN-powered radio galaxies decreases towards higher galaxy density environments within the clusters. This is consistent with previous studies which have found evidence for environmental quenching of star formation activity among massive galaxies. However we also find that there are many examples where powerful radio sources reside in dense regions without any obvious signs of being environmentally suppressed. These objects may be undergoing rapid evolution or they could represent a population of recently accreted field galaxies whose properties are still evolving to resemble those of their local counterparts. The sample consists of 20 radio galaxies selected from the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project catalogue (Smolčić et al., 2009) using the following criteria: 1) They lie in one of four X-ray luminous clusters at 0.4 < z < 0.8; 2) Their radio luminosity lies above L(3GHz) = 10 25 W Hz-1; 3) They do not show strong emission lines indicative of ongoing nuclear activity; 4) They were observed during our WHT run on 2010 May 24-25.",
    "We propose to use thermal noise as the information carrier for totally secure communications, zero power consumption devices, and computing systems. We show that by using an appropriate detection scheme, we can extract digital bits from the thermal noise with high fidelity at room temperature. The proposed system is based on a single-electron transistor (SET) which has been demonstrated in experiments recently. In addition, we demonstrate how this SET-based device can be used to perform logic operations such as AND gate and NOT gate. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our proposal including quantum key distribution, ultra-low power sensor networks, and energy efficient data centers. This work was supported by NSF under Grant No. ECCS-0926491. A new paradigm called \"thermal noise informatics\" is introduced where thermal noise is utilized as the information carrier for various tasks ranging from totally secure communication over wires to zero-power communication and computation. By employing an appropriate detection scheme, it is shown that one can extract digital bits from thermal noise with high fidelities even at room temperatures. It is also shown that these extracted digital bits can be used to perform logical operations such as AND gates and NOT gates. Possible applications are discussed along with their advantages compared to existing technologies.",
    "We present new constructions for locally decodable codes (LDCs) based on nice subsets of finite fields, prime factors of Mersenne numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem. Our first construction is an explicit family of LDCs with optimal query complexity that are derived from nice subsets of finite fields. We then show how to use these results in conjunction with the Chinese remainder theorem to obtain families of LDCs whose parameters can be tuned by varying the number of primes used in their construction. Finally we give a lower bound on the length of any LDC over a binary alphabet which uses only one-sided queries. The proofs of our main theorems appear at the end of this extended abstract. \nIntroduction\n\nLocally decodable codes (abbreviated as LCDs)\nare error correcting codes where each codeword has associated with it some decoding algorithm that allows efficient recovery of individual bits or symbols when queried about them. In particular, if the codeword is corrupted by up to t errors, then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that recovers the original uncorrupted word using O(t) queries per symbol. This property makes such codes useful in applications like data storage systems, peer-to-peer networks, and streaming media distribution services. \n \n A large body of work has been devoted towards understanding the trade-off between the rate of the code, its distance, and the query complexity of the decoder. For example, Guruswami et al. (2005), Chan et al. (2006) , and Kopparty & Saraf (2007)  studied the problem of constructing codes with low query complexity while maintaining high rates and distances. Recently, several works have focused on improving the known bounds on the minimum possible query complexity required to decode a single bit given a certain amount of corruption. These include the recent breakthrough result of Dvir et al. (2010a) (which improved upon the previous best-known upper bound due to Sudan et al., 2005 ) and the subsequent improvements made by Dvir et al. (2011 ), Feldman et al. (2012 , and Kopparty et al.

    "We present an analysis of the relativistic Riemann problem for ideal fluids in two space dimensions, with emphasis on the role played by vortex sheets. We show that the solution to this problem can be constructed as a sequence of self-similar solutions which are determined uniquely up to translations along the x-axis (the direction of propagation). The first step is to construct a family of exact solutions describing the interaction between a planar shock wave and a vortex sheet. These solutions have been obtained previously using different methods but we provide here a new derivation based on the method of characteristics. In particular, we obtain explicit expressions for the density and pressure profiles across the shock front. Next, we consider the case where the initial data consists of a single vortex sheet separating regions of constant density and pressure. This situation corresponds physically to a fluid initially at rest being accelerated impulsively by a piston moving at speed c = 1. We prove that there exists exactly one such solution corresponding to each value of the total mass M . Finally, we study numerically the evolution of more general initial data consisting of several vortex sheets separated by shocks.",
    "We propose a new string derived model with stable proton in which the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is not neutralino but gravitino. The LSP decays into photon or neutrino-antineutrino pair through gravitational interaction. In this scenario we can explain the observed dark matter abundance without conflicting with other experimental results such as relic density measurement by WMAP experiment. We also show that our model predicts interesting signatures at LHC experiments. Introduction:-The discovery of Higgs boson [1-3] has opened up an exciting possibility to explore physics beyond Standard Model(SM). Supersymmetry(SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of SM [4] , provides natural solution for hierarchy problem [5] . However, SUSY models are severely constrained by various experimental observations [6] .\nIn order to solve these problems, several authors have proposed different mechanisms [7-9]. One of them is introducing additional gauge symmetries [10] . Another way is adding extra dimensions [11] . Recently, it was shown that there exists a class of string derived models where the lightest superpartner is gravitino [12] . Gravitino is weakly interacting massive particle so its decay rate is suppressed compared to neutralino case [13] . This feature makes gravitino a good candidate for cold dark matter [14] . Moreover, if gravitino mass m 3/2 < 1 GeV then its lifetime becomes longer than age of universe [15] . Therefore, gravitino may be regarded as a viable candidate for dark matter [16] . On the other hand, gravitino is unstable because it couples to gravity [17] . It decays into photon or lepton-neutrino pairs [18] . If gravitino is heavier than 100 MeV then its decay products will contribute to diffuse gamma ray background [19] . Thus, gravitino should satisfy following conditions [20] :",
    "We report on the detection and characterization of a massive galaxy cluster, Abell S1063 (z = 0.90), using data obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster was discovered as part of an ongoing survey for distant clusters carried out by our team within the framework of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey Data Release 8 (UKIDSS DR8). We use photometric redshifts to select galaxies that are likely members of this structure over a large area around its center. Using these candidates we identify two brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) separated by about 1 arcmin along the line-of-sight. These BCGs have magnitudes mF160B = 20.6 ± 0.1 mag and mF140W = 21.0 ± 0.2 mag respectively. Their colors suggest they are both early-type galaxies.",
    "We present an analysis of the linear stability of epitaxially self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) on semiconductor surfaces, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy under conditions where QDs form spontaneously and in regular arrays. We show that the QD ordering is determined by two competing mechanisms: surface diffusion and strain relaxation. The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening. In particular we find that for small values of the QD size dispersion there exists a critical value of the growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be formed. This result explains why it has been so difficult to grow ordered QD arrays with large QD sizes using conventional techniques. \n \n Keywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs), also known as colloidal quantum dots, have attracted considerable attention due to their unique optical properties [1] . They can be used in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes [2] , lasers [3] , solar cells [4] , photodetectors [5] , etc., and they may even play important roles in biological systems [6] .\n \nThe most common method for growing QDs is based on the so-called Stranski-Krastanov process [7, 8] . It involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate at high temperatures followed by annealing at lower temperatures. Under these conditions islands nucleate randomly over the entire sample area but then evolve into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening [9] . However, this technique does not allow one to control the position of individual QDs within each array [10] . Recently developed methods [11, 12] enable us to produce highly ordered QD arrays; however, they require very precise temperature control during deposition [13] . \n \n 2 Model Description \n \n Here we consider a model describing the formation of QDs on a two-dimensional lattice. Our starting point is the continuum equation proposed by Tersoff et al. [14] :",
    "We present an experimental investigation into complementarity between position and momentum measurements on single photons using a modified version of the original Einstein-Bohr photon box experiment.  The results show that, for this particular measurement scheme, there is no violation of Bell's inequality or any other form of nonlocality. We also demonstrate how our setup can be used to investigate quantum contextuality by performing two different experiments with identical settings but opposite outcomes. In one case we observe violations of Bell inequalities while in the other they are not violated. This shows that the observed behavior cannot be explained within classical physics and demonstrates quantum contextuality. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical quantities such as position and momentum do not have simultaneous well-defined values. Instead these quantities exist only as probability distributions which evolve continuously over time according to Schrödinger's equation. However, it has been shown that if both position and momentum were measured simultaneously then their respective probabilities would interfere destructively resulting in a zero probability of measuring either quantity at its most probable value [1] . This phenomenon known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to the concept of complementarity: the impossibility of observing all properties of a system simultaneously [2] .\nIn 1964 John Bell showed that local hidden variable theories could not explain some predictions made by quantum mechanics [3] , leading to the formulation of Bell's theorem [4] . Since then many experiments have been performed to test whether quantum mechanical predictions violate Bell's theorem [5] . These tests typically involve entangled particles [6] where each particle carries information about the state of another distant particle [7, 8] . If the particles are separated far enough so that they never interact again after being created, then the correlations between them must be due solely to quantum effects [9] .",
    "We report on the discovery of an X-ray pulsar, PSR J1814-1744, associated with the unidentified TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1813-178 in the Galactic plane at l = 18.6 deg., b = -0.1 deg.. The pulsar has spin period Psr = 2.16 s and is located within 0.2 arcmin (0.01 pc) of the centroid position determined by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). We also discovered a faint extended nebula around this pulsar using Chandra observations. This nebula shows a shell-like structure with radius Rneb ~ 1.5 arcmin (0.06 pc), which is consistent with that expected for a wind nebula powered by the pulsar's relativistic winds. The observed flux density of the nebula at radio wavelengths is Fν(3 GHz) ~ 3 mJy beam-1 , while its luminosity at X-rays is Lx ~ 1033 erg s-1 . These values are comparable to those seen in other young pulsars.",
    "We report on observations made by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S. S.) telescope array in Namibia, which detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from the distant blazar  1ES1102-232 at redshift z = 0.186. The source was observed for more than 50 hours between September 2005 and March 2006 using data taken simultaneously with four telescopes. A total excess of 12 events above background were found within an energy range of 400 GeV to 20 TeV. No significant variability is seen during this period. We present results from spectral analysis performed over different time intervals as well as broadband modelling of the multi-wavelength spectrum including radio through X-ray measurements. This work demonstrates that H.E.S.  S. can detect sources beyond redshifts previously accessible only to ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. It also shows how such observations are important for understanding the physics of these extreme objects.",
    "We present results for the evolution of magnetized protostellar accretion discs in which we have included both Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as radiative transfer effects using flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We find that the inclusion of these additional physical processes has important consequences for disc structure and evolution.  In particular, we show that the presence of an initial magnetic field can significantly affect the mass distribution within the disc at early times by suppressing fragmentation near the central star. This leads to more massive discs than those found previously with purely hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting discs are also less flared due to the increased pressure support provided by the magnetic field. As time progresses, however, the magnetic field is dissipated through ohmic dissipation and turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities. Once this happens, the disc becomes thinner and more flared compared to non-magnetic models.",
    "We present the results of our investigation on semiclassical scalar propagator in curved space-time, which is based on the WKB approximation to the wave function. We show that there are two different ways how one can define this quantity depending on whether or not one takes into account the back-reaction effects due to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. The first approach leads to an expression for the semiclassical propagator which coincides with the Feynman propagator at large distances but differs significantly near the source point. In particular it does not satisfy the Hadamard condition required by general relativity. On the other hand, if we take into account the back reaction then the resulting expression satisfies all necessary conditions including the Hadamard condition. However, as was shown recently by Wald et al., such an expression cannot be obtained within the framework of standard QFT. This problem may have important consequences when considering the propagation of particles through black holes since the corresponding expressions differ substantially even outside the horizon.",
    "We present highly resolved numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the LANS-alpha model, which is known to produce good results for wall-bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades [1, 2] . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems [3–5] , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models [6] .\nIn recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged [7–10] . They are based",
    "We present new observations and analysis of the Balmer-dominated shocks driven by supernova remnants (SNRs) into dense molecular clouds, which are known as \"molecular cloud shocks\" or \"Balmer-dominated shocks\". We find that these shocks have an intermediate temperature between those of typical J-type and C-type shocks. The observed emission lines show prominent P-Cygni profiles with blueshifted absorption features indicating high velocities up to 100 km s-1 . These results suggest that the transition zone is located at the interface between the shocked gas and unshocked ambient medium. In addition, we found that the widths of the Hα line profiles increase toward the center of SNR W28. This indicates that the density structure of the surrounding environment may be more complicated than previously thought. Our study suggests that Balmer-dominated molecular cloud shocks can provide important information on the physical conditions of the interstellar medium around young SNRs.",
    "We present new U BVRI photometric observations for the barred galaxy NGC 3367, obtained with the 1 m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). The main goal is to study the stellar structures in this galaxy and their relation to its nuclear activity. We find that there are two bright knots along the major axis of the galaxy which may be associated with star formation regions. These knots have colors similar to those found in HII regions. In addition we detect several other faint knots on both sides of the nucleus. Their color indices suggest that they could also be related to recent star formation events. Finally, we identify an extended structure towards south-east direction whose nature remains unclear. This work was supported by CONACyT grant 36586-E. We thank J. M. Alloin for his help during our observing run at CTIO. Keywords: Starburst galaxies; Nuclear activity",
    "We present new near-infrared integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data for the brightest galaxy in the cluster Abell 2218, which is known to be interacting with its nearest neighbor, the radio-quiet quasar I Zw 1 at z = 0.0625. We find that this galaxy has an extended low-surface-brightness component surrounding it, extending out to about 10 kpc on both sides along the major axis. This feature shows no evidence of rotation but does show some velocity structure consistent with infalling gas or tidal debris. In addition we detect two compact objects within 5 kpc of the center of the galaxy. One of these appears to have a very high surface brightness and may represent a nuclear starburst; however, the other one displays much lower surface brightness and could possibly be associated with a supermassive black hole binary system. These results are discussed in terms of possible evolutionary scenarios for this interacting pair.",
    "We study the nonlinear perturbations of general relativity (GR) and other metric theories of gravity, focusing on their effects on conserved quantities such as energy-momentum tensors. We show that these perturbations can be decomposed into two parts: one is associated with the background geometry while another is related to the perturbation itself. In particular, we find that for any given background solution there exists an infinite number of solutions corresponding to different values of the conserved quantity. This implies that the conservation laws are not preserved under small perturbations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this effect may lead to violations of the weak equivalence principle. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for cosmology and black hole physics. General relativity (GR), which describes gravitational interactions at large scales, has been tested extensively against observations over many decades [1] . However, it remains unclear whether or not GR also holds true at smaller length scales where quantum mechanics becomes important [2] .\nIn order to address this question, several alternative theories have been proposed [3] , including scalar-tensor theories [4] , f(R)-gravity [5] , massive gravity [6] , and so forth [7, 8] . These theories typically involve additional degrees of freedom beyond those present in GR [9] . For example, in scalar-tensor theories, the graviton acquires a mass through its coupling to a scalar field [10] . Similarly, in f(R)-theories [11] , the Einstein-Hilbert action contains higher-order curvature terms [12] . It turns out that both types of theories admit self-accelerating solutions [13] , i.e., de Sitter-like solutions without requiring dark energy [14] .",
    "We report on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with different edge structures, including hydrogenated ZGNR (H-ZGNR), fluorinated ZGNR (F-ZGNR), oxygenated ZGNR (O-ZGNR), and nitrogen-doped O-ZGNR (N-ZGNR). We find that all these ZGNRs are half-metals except for H-ZGNR which is metallic. The band gaps of F-ZGNR and N-ZGNR increase as compared to those of pristine ZGNR due to the electronegativity difference between carbon atoms at edges and their neighbors. In contrast, the band gap decreases slightly when oxygen replaces one or two carbon atoms at each edge because of charge transfer from oxygen to neighboring carbon atom(s). Our results show that the spin polarization can be enhanced by introducing oxygen into the edges of ZGNRs.",
    "We present the results of an analysis of all available data on cometary dust tails, including those observed by spacecraft and ground-based telescopes in recent years. We find that most of these objects are associated with Jupiter family comets (JFCs), which have orbital periods less than 20 yr. The JFCs produce dust tails that can be traced for up to several thousand AU along their orbits. These tails appear as narrow streams of material extending outward at high speed from the parent bodies. In some cases they show evidence of being disrupted into multiple fragments or branches. Most of the tail structures we observe are consistent with models where particles are released continuously over time scales ranging from months to thousands of years. However, there is growing observational evidence suggesting that many of these tails may also contain significant amounts of freshly produced dust grains ejected during more recent outburst events. This suggests that the production rate of dust particles in these systems varies significantly both spatially and temporally. \n \n Keywords: Comet",
    "We present an effective model to study the properties of dense quark matter in the presence of large strange quarks masses, which are relevant for compact stars with high central density. The model is based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) Lagrangian extended by including vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom. We show that this extension allows us to reproduce simultaneously several features observed experimentally or theoretically in nuclear physics such as: i) saturation of nuclear matter; ii) appearance of hyperon resonances; iii) restoration of chiral symmetry at finite baryonic densities; iv) existence of a critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. In addition we find that our results agree well with recent lattice simulations performed within the framework of the PNJL model. Finally, we discuss how these findings can be used to explore new regions of the parameter space of the NJL model.",
    "We present the first results on differential rotation for an evolved star, based on observations with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) satellite. The target is the F-type main-sequence star kappa 1 Cet (HD 128898), which has been observed in two consecutive runs during 2005-2006. We find that the surface shear rate decreases towards lower latitudes, but increases again at mid-latitudes. This behaviour can be explained if we assume that there are two differentially rotating regions on opposite sides of the equator. In addition to this large-scale pattern, we also detect smaller-scale features such as spots and plages. These structures appear to have lifetimes between one week and several months. Finally, we show how our results compare with theoretical predictions made using stellar evolution models. Keywords: Differential rotation; Stellar activity; Spots; Plages; MOST",
    "We report the discovery of three planets orbiting an intermediate-mass subgiant star, HD 168625 (M = 1.5 Msun), using high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. The planet masses are 0.7 MJup , 2.1 MJup , and 3.2 MJup . We find that all three planets have orbital periods shorter than 100 days; two of them are close to their host stars (P orb < 10 d). All three planets are located within the habitable zone around their host star. This is one of only four systems known so far where more than one planet has been found inside this region.  These results demonstrate that it should be possible to detect terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of evolved stars by means of Doppler spectroscopy. Keywords: exoplanet, planetary system",
    "We study pair production of doubly-charged scalars in association with two jets, which can be induced by both weak gauge bosons (W or Z) and photons via loops involving heavy fermions such as top quarks. We derive constraints on the masses of these particles using current experimental data for W+jets and Z+jets processes collected by ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition to the standard model backgrounds, we also consider contributions from other new physics models that may have similar signatures. The results are presented in terms of exclusion limits on the mass parameters of various new physics scenarios. Finally, we discuss possible signals of this process at future runs of the LHC. PACS numbers: 12.60.Jv, 13 .85.Rm, 14.80.Ly \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe discovery of neutrinos has opened up an exciting possibility of probing beyond Standard Model (SM), especially its Majorana nature [1] , through their lepton number violating interactions [2] . One interesting scenario is the seesaw mechanism [3] where SM singlet right-handed neutrinos acquire large Majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking [4] .\nIn order to test whether the observed light neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, one needs to look for lepton-number-violating processes mediated by virtual heavy neutrinos [5] . These include neutrinoless double beta decay [6] , tritium beta decay [7] , and charged-current quasielastic scattering [8] . However, it turns out that all these processes suffer from severe astrophysical and/or nuclear matrix element uncertainties [9] . On the other hand, colliders provide clean environments to probe lepton number violation directly [10] . For example, searches for same-sign dileptons [11] and trileptons [12] at hadronic colliders could lead to important information about Majorana neutrinos [13] . Another promising channel is the production of doubly-charge scalar particles [14] , which can occur either through s-channel exchange of neutral gauge bosons [15] or t-channel exchange of heavy ferm",
    "The stopping power for uranium ions was measured at the National Superconducting Cyclotrons Laboratory (NSCL) using a thick target method and an ion chamber placed downstream of the target.  The results are compared to calculations based on the TRIM code, which is used extensively by nuclear physicists studying heavy-ion reactions. A good agreement between experiment and theory has been found over most of the range studied here. However, there appears to be some discrepancy near the end of the range where the experimental data show less stopping than predicted by the TRIM calculation. This may indicate that the TRIM model underestimates the contribution of electronic excitation processes to the total stopping cross section. These measurements provide useful information about the behavior of uranium ions as they slow down through matter. They can also serve as input parameters into models describing the transport of energetic particles in matter. Stopping powers were determined experimentally for uranium ions incident upon thin targets of carbon, copper, gold, silver, lead, tin, aluminum, iron, nickel, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, ytterbium, and uranium metal. Measurements were made at NSCL's Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility using a thick-target method and an ion chamber located downstream of the target. Results are presented along with comparisons to theoretical predictions obtained from the TRIM computer program.",
    "The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is an essential component of the muscle cell membrane, which provides structural support to skeletal muscles during contraction.  The DGC consists of several proteins including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin.   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding for dystrophin lead to loss of this protein from the sarcolemma resulting in severe muscle wasting.  However, it has been shown that expression of utrophin can compensate for the absence of dystrophin by binding to other components of the DGC such as alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG).  This study investigated whether processing of beta-dystroglycan affects its ability to bind with utrophin or its homologous counterpart, dp116, using normal mouse Schwann cells (MSC) and mdx mice lacking functional dystrophin.  Beta-dystroglycan was found to be processed into two different forms in both MSCs and mdx sciatic nerves.  One form had a molecular weight similar to that observed in normal mouse brain tissue while another form showed higher mobility when compared to the first one.  Both forms were able to interact with utrophin but only the lower molecular weight form could also bind to dp116.  These results suggest that processing of betadystroglycan may affect its interaction with utrophin and/or dp116.",

    "We present the Bridge algorithm, which is an efficient direct tree hybrid n-body method that can be used to simulate fully self-consistently star clusters in galactic potentials with arbitrary mass distributions. The Bridge algorithm combines the advantages of both direct-summation (DS) and tree methods by using DS only within small sub-groups of particles at each time step while solving the full system of equations on a tree. We show that this approach allows us to achieve high accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. In particular we demonstrate that our new code reproduces results obtained with the state-of-the-art treecode NBODY6++GPU very well even when simulating systems containing up to 10 million stars. This makes it possible to study the long-term dynamical evolution of open clusters as well as globular clusters orbiting around parent galaxies over many Gyr timescales. \n \n Keywords: Open cluster; Globular cluster; Galactic potential",
    "We present an extension to the standard model that includes gravity, based on Feynman's ideas about quantum gravity. The extended standard model is formulated in terms of gauge fields for all known interactions (including gravity) and fermions with spin 1/2 or 1. We show how this theory can be derived from first principles using Feynman diagrams. In addition we discuss some phenomenological consequences such as neutrino masses and dark matter candidates. Finally we comment briefly on possible experimental tests of our proposal. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. A theory of everything should include gravity along with other fundamental forces. Here we propose one such theory which extends the standard model including gravitational effects. Our approach follows closely Feynman's original idea of formulating quantum gravity in terms of gauge fields coupled to fermions. Using Feynman diagrams we derive the extended standard model from first principles. Some phenomenological consequences are discussed, e.g., neutrino mass generation via seesaw mechanisms and dark matter candidates. Possible experiments testing our proposal are also mentioned.",
    "We have investigated whether pulsar timing observations can be used to detect gravitational waves by observing the Shapiro effect, which is caused by the passage of gravitational waves through space-time around the Earth and its companion star (the Sun). We find that this method will not work with current technology because it requires very accurate measurements of pulse arrival times over many years. However, we show how future radio telescopes could make such measurements if they are equipped with new technologies like phased-array feeds or digital backends. In addition, we discuss other possible methods using pulsar timing data to search for gravitational waves. Gravitational waves cause time delays between pulses emitted at different points on the surface of a rotating neutron star. These time delays depend on the distance between these points as well as their position relative to the line-of-sight towards the observer. The most prominent effects occur when the wave passes close to the Earth and its companion stars. This causes an additional delay known as the Shapiro effect [Shapiro 1964] . If one knows the positions of all pulsars within a globular cluster, then one can use the observed pulse arrival times to measure the distances between them. By comparing these measured distances with those predicted by general relativity, one can test whether Einstein's theory correctly describes gravity on large scales.",
    "We present Herschel Space Observatory observations at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns toward two fields centered on the densest parts of the Rho Ophiuchi (RO) molecular cloud complex. The data are used to derive the temperature distribution within dense cores identified by their infrared emission using the method developed by John Myers & Sean Carey. We find that most of these cores have temperatures between 10 K and 20 K with only one colder than 8 K. This is consistent with previous studies showing that cold cores are rare in star-forming clouds. Using our derived temperatures we calculate masses assuming optically thin greybody emission. These masses range from 0.1 Msun to more than 100 Msun. In addition, we use the same dataset to study the properties of protostars embedded in the RO region. We identify 16 Class I sources based on their spectral energy distributions and compare them to those found in other nearby star-forming regions such as Serpens South or Orion B North.",
    "We present an approach to temporal runtime verification based on monadic difference logic (MDL). MDL is a decidable fragment of first-order logic with the ability to express properties about sequences of states, such as those produced by model checkers or execution traces. We show how to translate formulas in this logic into automata and use these automata for monitoring executions against specifications expressed in MDL. Our translation preserves satisfiability and allows us to monitor infinite state systems. The resulting monitors are efficient enough that they can be used online during program execution. In addition we provide a method for reducing the size of the generated automata which makes them suitable for offline analysis. Finally, we demonstrate our technique on several examples including a Java implementation of the dining philosophers problem. This work was supported by NSF grant CCF-0430018.

    "We report on non-adiabatic effects in dissociative oxygen adsorption and desorption processes occurring at low temperatures (<100 K). The experiments were performed using an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope equipped with a molecular beam source for dosing O 2 molecules onto clean, well-ordered Al(111) surfaces held at different sample temperatures between 10 and 100 K. We find that the sticking probability decreases strongly when increasing the surface temperature due to thermal activation of vibrational modes which lead to non-collinearity of electronic states involved in the reaction process. This effect is also observed during the subsequent desorption of atomic oxygen from the surface. In addition we observe a pronounced dependence of the sticking coefficient on the kinetic energy of incident oxygen molecules: At high energies (>500 meV), where the molecule-surface interaction time becomes comparable or even shorter than typical vibrational periods, the sticking probability increases again as compared to lower kinetic energies.",
    "We present the theory behind relativistic fluctuation theorems, which are exact relations between entropy production in nonequilibrium processes and fluctuations in equilibrium states. We show that these results can be derived using only standard statistical mechanics techniques applied to systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking interactions. In particular we derive an expression for the entropy production rate in terms of correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. This result is used to calculate the entropy production rates associated with several simple models including Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, and driven harmonic oscillators. Finally, we discuss how our approach may be extended beyond classical physics. Relativistic fluctuation theorems provide exact relations between entropy production during non-equilibrium processes and fluctuations in corresponding equilibrium states. These results have been obtained by applying standard statistical mechanics methods to systems with broken timereversal invariance. Here we use this formalism to obtain expressions for the entropy production rate as well as other quantities such as heat currents in terms of correlation functions evaluated at thermal equilibrium. As concrete applications we consider several simple models including Browninan motion, Langevin dynamics and driven harmonic oscillators. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Entropy production plays a central role in many areas of science ranging from biology [1] , chemistry [2] , geophysics [3] , and neuroscience [4] . It has also become increasingly important in quantum information processing [5] where it provides a measure of irreversibility [6] . Despite its importance there remains no general method for calculating entropy production rates except in very special cases [7–9] . Recently, however, new theoretical tools based on fluctuation theorems [10–12] have emerged which allow one to relate entropy production directly to measurable properties of physical systems [13–18] . For example, in recent years there has been considerable interest in developing experimental schemes [19–21] capable of measuring entropy production rates in small isolated quantum systems [22] . Such experiments would enable direct tests of fundamental thermodynamic principles [23] and could potentially lead to practical devices for extracting work from heat baths [24] . \n \n 2 Classical fluctuation theorems \n \n Perhaps the most famous fluctuation theorem was first proposed by Jarzynski [10]",
    "We present the results on the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for stars at different latitudes and distances from the Galactic plane, based on spectroscopic data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that MDFs are similar to each other within errors except those at |b| > 30° where there is an excess of metal-poor stars compared to the disk population. The fraction of metal-poor stars increases towards higher latitude. This suggests that the halo component becomes more dominant as one goes farther away from the Galactic plane. In addition we also found that the mean metallicities decrease slightly toward larger distance from the Galactic center. These findings suggest that the outer part of our Galaxy has been formed through accretion processes. \n \n Keywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It is well known that the Milky Way consists of three main components -the thin disk, thick disk and halo. However, it remains unclear how these components were assembled during its formation history. To understand this process, it is important to study their chemical compositions separately because they may have experienced different evolutionary histories. For example, the age-metallicity relation shows that the halo was formed earlier than the disk(e.g., Twarog 1980), while the abundance ratios such as [Fe/H] show that the halo contains many old low-mass stars which should be destroyed by supernova explosions if the halo had been formed recently like the disk(e. g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). \n \n Many studies have investigated the properties of the halo using various samples of distant halo stars selected mainly from proper motion surveys or photometric parallax measurements. Recently, large spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , RAVE survey (Steinmetz 2003 )and SEGUE survey (Yanny et al. 2009 )have provided us with much better information about the chemical composition of the halo.

    "We present the results of N-body simulations for open and globular star clusters with different initial conditions, including primordial binaries in various proportions (from 0 to 100%). We find that the fraction of binaries among all stars decreases as the cluster evolves due to dynamical interactions between single and binary stars. The decrease is more pronounced if there are initially many hard binaries or few soft ones. In addition, we show how the number of binaries depends on their binding energy distribution at birth. Finally, we compare our results with observations of real open and globular clusters. Our main conclusions are:  1) Open clusters have fewer binaries than globulars because they lose most of them during early evolution.  2) Binaries can be destroyed by three-body encounters even when the total number of binaries remains constant.  3) Hard binaries dominate over soft ones after several relaxation timescales t rh .",
    "In this paper, we propose an autonomous distributed admission control scheme to improve the performance and fairness in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The proposed scheme is based on the concept that each station maintains its own queue length information by using the packet inter-arrival time at the physical layer. In addition, it uses the number of active stations as well as their transmission rates to determine whether or not new connections are admitted into the network. We show through simulation results that our scheme can achieve better throughput than existing schemes while maintaining good fairness among competing stations. Keywords: Wireless Local Area Networks, Packet Inter-Arrival Time, Fairness, Throughput Improvement. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of mobile computing devices such as laptops, PDAs, smart phones etc., there has been growing interest in providing high quality services over wireless local area networks (WLANS) [1] . However, due to limited bandwidth resources available in WLANs, efficient resource management becomes crucially important [2] .\nThe most widely used medium access control protocol in current commercial WLAN products is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which provides both contention-based channel access mechanism called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) [3] , and contention-free service via Point Coordinated Function (PCF) [4] . Although CSMA/CA allows multiple stations to share the same radio channel simultaneously without any centralized coordination, it suffers from poor system performance when the traffic load increases [5] . This problem is mainly caused by the hidden terminal effect [6] where two nodes may transmit packets to one another simultaneously causing collisions. To alleviate these problems, several approaches have been proposed [7 -10] . Among them, the authors in [8] introduced a simple but effective method known as Virtual Reservation Channel (VRC) to reduce the probability of collision between data frames transmitted by different stations. They also presented a modified version of VRC [9] to further enhance the performance of CSMA/CA under heavy loads. However, all these works assume that the number of active stations within the",
    "We present the results on the super quantum mechanics (SQM) in dimer models with free fermion boundary conditions. We show that SQM is equivalent to the usual quantum mechanics for periodic boundary condition case. In addition we find that there are two different types of supersymmetric ground states depending on whether or not the number of particles N is even. For odd N , the ground state has zero energy but it does not have any degeneracy. On the other hand, when N is even, the ground state becomes doubly degenerate. The degeneracy can be understood by using the concept of parity symmetry breaking. Finally we discuss how our result fits into the general framework of supersymmetry. PACS: 11.10.Wx, 05.45.Mt, 11.15.Tk \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn this work we study the super quantum mechanics ( S Q M ) i n d im e r m odels w ith f ree fermi b oundary c o ndition s . T hese models were first introduced by Rokhsar et al [1] as an exactly solvable model which describes spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice. They showed that these models exhibit many interesting properties such as spontaneous dimerization at low temperatures [2] .\nThe main purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of boundary conditions on the supersymmetric structure of the system. It turns out that the supersymmetric structure depends crucially on the boundary conditions imposed on the system. As will become clear later, the supersymmetric structure changes drastically if one switches between periodic and free-fermion boundary conditions.",
    "We report on the discovery of an Einstein ring galaxy at z = 1.62, which is composed of two merging galaxies with different mass-to-light ratios (M/L). The lensing galaxy has M/LB = 0.7 ± 0.1 for B-band luminosity LB = 2 × 10^10L⊙, while its companion galaxy has M/LB > 5. We find that this system can be explained by a model where the lensing galaxy consists of both luminous and dark components, but the companion galaxy does not have any dark component. This suggests that the fraction of dark matter to total mass increases as one goes down in mass scale. \n \n Keywords: Dark Matter, Galaxy Evolution, Gravitational Lens, Massive Black Hole \n \n \n \n A&A proofs: manuscript no. ms \nThe existence of dark matter around galaxies is inferred mainly through gravitational lensing effects such as strong lensing or weak lensing. In particular, the presence of multiple images due to strong lensing provides us with information about the distribution of dark matter along the line-of-sight toward distant objects. However, it remains unclear how much dark matter exists within individual galaxies themselves because we cannot directly observe them. Here we present new results based on our ongoing survey program using Subaru/Suprime-Cam. Our target was selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 photometric catalogs, and follow-up observations were carried out with Suprime-Cam mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope. As a result, we discovered a gravitationally lensed object at redshift z = 1.62 consisting of three images produced by a foreground galaxy acting as a lens. Two of these images are located close together near the center of the lensing galaxy, whereas the third image lies far away from the lensing galaxy. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging data taken under the Hubble Frontier Fields project, we found that there exist two merging galaxies in front of the background source. One of these galaxies shows clear signs of tidal interaction between itself and the other galaxy.",
    "We present cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that follow the formation of galaxy clusters in the preheating scenario, where gas is heated by an early generation of stars before it collapses into dark matter haloes. We compare our results with observations of X-ray luminosity-temperature relations (L-T) at z = 0 as well as temperature profiles out to large radii. Our simulated L-T relation agrees very well with observational data over three orders of magnitude in luminosity. The slope of the observed L-T relation steepens towards lower temperatures while we find no such trend in our simulation. This discrepancy may be due to additional heating mechanisms not included in our model or due to systematic uncertainties in the observational sample. In addition, we show that the entropy profile of our simulated cluster population can reproduce the shape of observed profiles within their scatter. However, there are significant differences between individual simulated clusters and real systems which could be caused by non-gravitational processes like AGN feedback.",
    "The authors present the results of their study on the scattering between two protons and one neutron, which is known as the triton channel in nuclear physics.  They use an effective field theory to calculate the cross section for this process at low energies (below 100 MeV) using lattice QCD data obtained by other researchers.   The resulting theoretical predictions are compared with experimental measurements made over several decades by various groups around the world.    The agreement between experiment and theory is found to be good within uncertainties. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231. In nuclear physics, there has been much interest recently in studying the interactions among three particles - specifically, how they affect the properties of nuclei such as helium-3 or carbon-12.  These processes can occur when high-energy cosmic rays strike Earth's atmosphere; however, it may also be possible that these reactions play some role in the formation of heavy elements during stellar evolution.  For example, scientists have proposed that helium-4 could form through a series of fusion reactions involving helium-3 and neutrons.  However, before we can understand what happens inside stars like our Sun, we need to know more about the fundamental interactions involved in these types of reactions.  To help us learn more about them, physicists at MIT used lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a technique similar to those employed in high energy experiments but performed on computers instead of accelerators, to predict the behavior of certain nuclear reactions.  Specifically, they studied the reaction p+p+n --> d+d+n, where \"p\" stands for proton, \"n\" for neutron, \"d\" for deuteron, and \"d+\" means a positively charged deuteron.  Their calculations were based on...",
    "The radial distribution of the inner magnetospheric (IM) plasma pressure is studied by analyzing the magnetic field and particle measurements made onboard two satellites at low altitude in the equatorial plane for an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred between March 1-5, 1982 . The results show that there are significant differences in the IM plasma pressure profiles obtained with different satellites. In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system. This suggests that the observed difference in the pressure profiles can be attributed mainly to the spatial variation of the pressure rather than temporal changes.",
    "We present an analytic expression for the thermal Casimir force acting on two parallel plates made out of different materials, one being metallic (silver) while another is dielectric (silicon dioxide). The result obtained agrees with that derived by Lifshitz theory within 1% accuracy in the whole range of separations considered here. We also show how our results can be used to calculate the temperature dependence of the Casimir pressure at fixed separation distance. \n \n In this work we consider the case where one plate consists of silver and other of silicon dioxide. Silver has been chosen because it is widely used as a coating material in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), whereas SiO2 is often employed as a substrate or insulator layer in MEMS devices. Our results are applicable not only to these specific cases but also to any system consisting of two parallel plates separated by vacuum gap filled with gas medium. This includes such diverse situations like semiconductor heterostructures, quantum dots, nanowires etc., which have attracted considerable attention recently due to their potential applications in nanotechnology. \n \n It should be noted that the problem under consideration was first addressed theoretically more than 50 years ago [1] . However, despite numerous attempts [2] , no exact solution has yet been found. Therefore, most theoretical studies were performed using approximate methods [3] - [6] . These approaches include various modifications of the proximity force approximation [7, 8] , the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov method [9] , the multiple reflection expansion [10] , the scattering matrix formalism [11] , the Green's function technique [12] , the density functional theory [13] , the mode summation [14] , the fluctuating surface charge model [15] , the effective-medium theory [16] , the generalized plasmon-pole model [17] , the Drude-Lorentz model [18] , the hydrodynamic model [19] , the nonlocal response [20] , the local field correction [21] , the random phase approximation [22] , the Monte Carlo simulation [23] , the finite element method [24] , the numerical integration [25] , the variational principle [26] , the perturbation theory [27] , the renormalization group [28] , the self-consistent screening [29] ,",
    "We present new results on the evolution of the dust content in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) using deep near-infrared data obtained by the UltraVISTA survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III program. We use these observations to study the rest-frame UV-optical properties of LBGs at redshifts 1<z<3.5. The main goal of this work was to investigate how the dust extinction evolves as a function of galaxy mass and star formation rate density over cosmic time. Our analysis shows that there are two different populations of LBGs: one population has low stellar masses (M*=10^10-10^11 Msun), high specific star formation rates (SSFR>100Gyr-1), and relatively small amounts of dust; while another population consists of more massive systems (M*>10^11Msun), lower SSFR values (SSFR<30Gyr-1), and higher levels of dust extinction. These findings suggest that the amount of dust increases with increasing galaxy mass for both local and distant galaxies.",
    "We report the discovery of an isolated white dwarf (WD) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, SDSSJ104341.53 + 085558.2, which has a large infrared excess and is surrounded by dusty material that may be part of a debris disc. The WD's temperature is T eff = 13000 ± 1000 K, its radius R wd = 0.0120 ± 0.0010 R ⊙ , and it has log g = 8.0 ± 0.1 cm s −2 . We find no evidence for binarity or accretion activity associated with this object. This is only the second known example of such a system; the first was GD 362. Our results suggest that these systems are rare but not unique among WDs. If confirmed, they would provide important constraints on models of planetary formation around WDs. \n \n Keywords: White dwarfs",
    "We propose to search for new physics in events with two energetic jets and large missing transverse energy (MET) using data collected by the CDF experiment during Run II of Fermilab's Tevatron Collider. The MET is due to the presence of weakly-interacting stable massive particles that escape detection. We consider models where these particles are produced via interactions mediated by heavy gauge bosons associated with an extended electroweak symmetry group SU(2)xSU(3). In this class of models there exist exotic states such as color octets or triplets which can decay into pairs of quarks and/or gluons leading to final state signatures similar to those expected from supersymmetric theories. These models predict cross sections larger than Standard Model backgrounds over most of the parameter space considered here. This analysis will be performed on 1 fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by CDF between 2002-2007 corresponding to about 2 million events.",
    "The BFKL equation is an effective theory for describing high-energy scattering processes at small Bjorken-x, where x denotes the fraction of longitudinal momentum carried by one of the colliding hadrons or nuclei. The BFKL formalism has been developed into a practical tool to calculate cross sections and structure functions using numerical methods. In this talk I will present recent results on the calculation of the gluon Green's function within the framework of the so-called \"dipole approach\" which allows us to perform calculations analytically. This method was first introduced by Mueller and Tang in order to study diffractive deep-inelastic scattering (DDIS) off protons. It can be applied also to other processes like heavy quark production in proton-proton collisions as well as photon-photon interactions. We will discuss how we have implemented these ideas numerically and show some preliminary results obtained with our code. Finally, we will comment on possible extensions of this work towards more realistic phenomenological applications.",
    "The Blazhko effect is one of the most mysterious phenomena in pulsating stars, and it has been observed for more than 100 years now only on RR Lyrae-type variables (RR Lyr). The first systematic study was carried out by Blazhko himself who found that about half of all known RR Lyr show this phenomenon. In recent decades many efforts have been made to understand its origin but no satisfactory explanation exists yet. \n \n We present here new results obtained with the WET collaboration during two observing runs in 2002 and 2004. Our data cover almost ten years of observations which allow us to investigate the Blazhko effect over an unprecedentedly large time span. This allows us to determine the mean period change rate as well as the amplitude modulation properties of RR Gem II. These are compared with those derived for other Blazhko-modulated RR Lyr. \nWe find that our results agree very well with previous studies.",
    "We report on an unusual bright optical transient (OT) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). The OT was detected at R = 16.7 mag and peaked at R = 14.6 mag, with a rise time of about 1 day. It is located near the center of M85, one of the nearest galaxies to our own Milky Way Galaxy. We find that this event has many properties similar to those observed for supernovae Ia but it lacks spectroscopic signatures typical of these events. This suggests that we are witnessing another type of explosion which may be related to some other types of transients such as tidal disruption flares or superluminous supernovae. \n \n Keywords: Supernova, Optical transient, PTF, Tidal disruption flare, Brightest cluster galaxy \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there have been several discoveries of extremely luminous optical transients associated with nearby galaxies. These include the famous outbursts of Eta Carinae (Davidson & Humphreys 1997; Smith et al. 1998), SN 2005ap (Gal-Yam et al. 2005; Foley et al. 2007), ASASSN-14li (Holoien et al. 2014a), ATLAS14aaq (Dong et al. 2015), PS1-10jh (Gezari et al. 2012), iPTF16axa (Kasliwal et al. 2016), and ASASSN-15oi (Shappee et al. 2016). Many of them were found to be associated with supermassive black holes residing in galactic nuclei. However, their exact nature remains unclear. Some authors suggested that they could be caused by tidal disruptions of stars by massive black holes (TDE) (Komossa 2002; Gezari et al. 2009a; Bloom et al. 2011; Holoien et al. 2013b; Arcavi et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2017), while others argued that they might represent new classes of thermonuclear explosions (SNe Ia-like) (Valenti et al. 2009; Kas",
    "The Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed the supernova remnant (SNR) produced by SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud for over ten years, providing an unprecedented view into this young and energetic object.  The observations have revealed that the blast wave is interacting with dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor star at velocities up to 1000 km/sec.  This interaction produces bright knots of emission which are seen as moving outward through the shell of the remnant.  These knots appear to be composed primarily of oxygen-rich ejecta mixed with shocked interstellar gas.  In addition, there appears to be a large amount of hot plasma trapped behind the forward shock front.  We present here new results on these features based on our analysis of data obtained during the first year of the Chandra mission.

    "The isobaric analog state (IAS) in nuclei has been studied by using the folding model with microscopic nucleon-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The IAS was found to be sensitive to both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the nuclear matter density distribution as well as the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. In particular, it was shown that the IAS can provide useful information about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. It was also demonstrated that the effect of the tensor force on the IAS depends strongly on the choice of the nuclear mean-field potentials used for describing the ground-state properties of nuclei. Finally, we have discussed how one could extract the information about the nuclear symmetry energy from experimental data on the IAS in heavy nuclei. PACS numbers: 25.20.Lj, 27.60.+j, 29.40.+s",
    "We study the effect of radiative transfer (RT) on ultraviolet pumping of the 21 cm line at high redshifts, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with RT and without it. We find that RT can significantly enhance the strength of the 21 cm signal by up to an order of magnitude compared to calculations neglecting RT effects. The enhancement is caused mainly by Lyman-alpha photons produced inside galaxies which are absorbed outside them due to scattering off neutral hydrogen atoms. This leads to additional heating of the intergalactic medium through photoionization heating and Compton cooling. In addition we show that the inclusion of RT also changes the shape of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that future radio telescopes such as SKA will be able to detect this signal if they have sufficient sensitivity.

    "We report on the detection by HESS of an exceptional flaring activity in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray band for the blazar PKS 2155-304, which was observed between September and November 2007 with a flux doubling time scale as short as ~1 day. The source reached its highest recorded state ever detected at TeV energies during this period. We present results based on data taken simultaneously with Swift-XRT and UVOT instruments that show no significant change in X-ray or optical emission properties over the course of the outburst. This suggests that the high-energy emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons located close to the central black hole rather than synchrotron radiation emitted by particles accelerated up to high Lorentz factors within the jet itself. These findings are consistent with theoretical models where particle acceleration takes place in shocks formed when jets collide with surrounding clouds.

    "We study the dynamics of carrier-carrier interactions in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by solving numerically the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for two interacting electrons or holes confined to an anisotropic QD potential well. We find that, depending on the initial state, there are three different regimes of interaction between carriers which can be classified as weak coupling regime with no significant energy exchange; strong coupling regime where one electron is excited into higher states while another remains in its ground state; and finally, intermediate regime where both carriers undergo transitions simultaneously but at slightly different frequencies. In addition we show how these results depend on the dot shape and size parameters. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings such as generation of entangled photon pairs via biexciton decay. Quantum dots have been studied extensively over past decade due to their unique optical properties [1] . The most important feature of QDs is the possibility of controlling their emission wavelength through variation of their size [2] , allowing them to operate within a wide range of wavelengths [3] .\nIn this work we focus on studying the effects of carrier-carrier interactions [4] in semiconductor QDs using numerical solution of timedependent Schrödinger equations [5] . Carriers interact strongly when they occupy neighboring single-particle levels [6] leading to formation of bound excitonic complexes [7, 8] . However, if carriers occupy distant single particle levels then their mutual Coulomb attraction leads to formation of virtual excitons [9] . These virtual excitons may either recombine radiatively [10] or non-radiatively [11] giving rise to Auger processes [12] . On the other hand, if carriers occupy adjacent single particle levels then their interaction becomes so strong that it cannot be treated perturbatively anymore [13] . This situation occurs e.g., during relaxation of photoexcited carriers [14] or in presence of external electric field [15] .",
    "We present an approach to the analysis of metabolic networks based on information-theoretic concepts, in particular Shannon's entropy measure. We show that this concept can be extended by considering not only single metabolites but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as elementary units for measuring entropy. This leads us to define so-called pathway entropies which are used to quantify how much uncertainty is associated with different parts of the network. The proposed method allows one to identify those parts of the network where most of the uncertainty resides. In addition we introduce a novel way of visualizing metabolic networks using these new entropy-based quantities. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by applying it to two examples taken from biochemistry literature. Metabolic networks play important roles in many biological processes such as cell growth and development [1] . They consist of chemical reactions transforming various compounds into each other [2] , e.g., glucose molecules are transformed into energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via glycolysis [3] .\nThe study of metabolic networks has been attracting increasing interest over recent years [4] - [8] . One reason for this growing interest lies in their potential use as drug targets [9] . Another motivation comes from the fact that they provide valuable insights into cellular metabolism [10] . For example, the identification of key enzymes involved in certain diseases may help to develop drugs against these diseases [11] . Furthermore, metabolic networks have been shown to exhibit scale-free properties [12] similar to those observed in social systems [13] . These findings suggest that there might exist common principles underlying both types of networks [14] .\nIn order to understand the functioning of metabolic networks better, several mathematical models have been developed [15] - [17] . Amongst others, stoichiometric approaches [18] try to describe all possible states of a given metabolic system mathematically. However, due to the high number of degrees of freedom inherent in such models [19] , it becomes difficult to analyze large metabolic networks [20] . Therefore, alternative methods have been suggested [21] - [23] .",
    "We present optical and near-infrared photometry of SN 2006bp, which was discovered on September 24th in NGC 6946 by amateur astronomer Brian Puckett (Puckett et al., 2007) . The supernova is located at an unusually large distance for its host galaxy, with a recession velocity of ~1000 km/sec. \n \n We find that the light curve can be well fit using a model consisting of three components: shock breakout emission, radioactive decay powered luminosity, and dust extinction. Using this model we derive physical parameters such as the progenitor radius, mass loss rate, and explosion energy. Our results are consistent with those found for other type-II SNe but suggest that the progenitor star had a lower initial mass than previously thought. This may indicate that there exists more diversity among progenitors of type-II SNe than has been realized so far. In addition to these findings, our observations provide new insights into the physics of shock breakout and early-time evolution of type-II SNe.",
    "We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized, rotating white dwarf stars that undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC). We find that for sufficiently rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields, AIC leads to an explosion with properties similar to those observed in SNe Ia. The explosion is driven by the release of gravitational energy as the collapsed core bounces back after reaching nuclear density. In addition, we show that the presence of a strong toroidal field can lead to significant asymmetries in the ejecta distribution. These asymmetries are likely responsible for the polarization signal detected in some SNe Ia. \n \n Keywords: Supernovae Type Ia, Rotation, Magnetic Fields, White Dwarf Stars, Accretion Induced Collapse \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Recent observations have shown that many supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) exhibit large amounts of linear polarization [1] . This has been interpreted as evidence that these events result from asymmetric explosions [2] , which may be caused by large-scale magnetic fields [3] or rapid rotation [4] . However, it remains unclear whether either mechanism alone could produce such highly polarized light curves [5] . \n \n Here we investigate how the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic field affects the outcome of accretion induced collapse (AIC), where a white dwarf star collapses into a neutron star [6] . For this purpose, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the code FLASH [7] . Our initial models consist of rigidly-rotating white dwarf stars with masses ranging between 0.6-1.2 Msun [8] . To account for the effects of general relativity on the structure of the white dwarf [9] , we use the polytropic equation of state P = Kρ Γ , where ρ denotes the mass density and P the pressure [10] . \nThe main goal of this work is to determine if AICs triggered by rapid rotation and/or strong magnetic fields can explain the high degree of polarization observed in SNe Ia [11] .",
    "We present an analysis of the Bondi accretion rate onto primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era, taking into account the effects of pressure and viscosity on the gas flow. We find that for PBH masses M ≫ 10^(10) g, the Bondi radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so that the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formula can be used to calculate the accretion rate. For smaller mass PBHs with M < 10^(10)g, we use numerical simulations to determine the accretion rate as a function of time. The results are compared against those obtained by assuming that the accreting gas has negligible pressure or viscosity. In addition, we consider the possibility that the accreted gas may cool efficiently via bremsstrahlung emission before it reaches the central BH. Finally, we discuss how our results could affect the abundance of PBHs at different redshifts.",
    "We present results for photoionised gas in an expanding spherical shell, irradiated by multiple point-like and extended sources with different luminosities and spatial distributions. We find that the presence of additional sources can significantly affect the thermal state of the gas at large distances (several times larger than the Strömgren radius) from the central source(s). The effect is more pronounced when the number density of the surrounding medium decreases rapidly towards the outer boundary of the cloud. In this case, the contribution to heating due to external radiation becomes comparable or even exceeds the internal energy input from the central source(es), resulting in higher temperatures throughout most of the volume occupied by the shell. This may have important implications for the interpretation of observations of extragalactic HII regions. We also show how the inclusion of dust grains affects our results. Finally we discuss possible applications of these findings to other astrophysical problems such as the formation of planetary nebulae. \n \n Keywords: Photoionization",
    "We study the correlations and sum rules in a semi-infinite system with impurities at its surface, which is described by the quantum two-dimensional (2D) one component plasma model. We use the exact diagonalization method to calculate the density-density correlation function and static structure factor as well as their corresponding sum rules. The results show that there are two different regimes depending on whether the temperature T is larger or smaller than the Fermi energy EF . In particular, we find that when T < EF , the behavior of these quantities can be understood within the framework of Landau's Fermi liquid theory. However, if T > EF , our numerical data deviate significantly from this picture. Finally, we also investigate how the presence of impurities affects the above mentioned physical properties. Our findings suggest that the effect of impurities depends strongly on the distance between them. If they are close enough, then the impurity-impurity interaction dominates over other interactions leading to an increase of the effective mass of particles near the surface.",
    "We present the results of an analysis of microlensing events detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and its follow-up network, including the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration (MOA). We have identified 16 new planets among these events using high-precision photometry obtained at Subaru Observatory. The masses of all but one planet are determined to be less than 1 M⊕ . Fourteen of them are found to orbit stars more massive than 0.5 M⊙ , while two others are around low-mass dwarfs. These planets are located between 0.1 AU and 4 AU away from their host stars. This is the first time that such a large number of extrasolar planets has been discovered through space-based microlensing surveys. Our sample includes several planets whose orbits lie close to or beyond Neptune's semi-major axis. In addition, we find evidence for planetary companions to three binary systems.",
    "The crystal structure of the title compound, C7H14N2O4·H2O, has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis at room temperature.  The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of alanine in which both carboxylate groups are protonated to give an overall charge of +1. In the crystal lattice each amino acid is linked via O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds into chains running parallel to [010] . These chains are further connected through N-H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions between adjacent molecules along the c-axis direction leading to layers perpendicular to (001). The water molecules form intermolecular O-H⋯O and O-H⋯π interactions with neighbouring amino acids within these layers. A comparison of bond lengths shows that there is no significant difference between the two polymorphic structures reported for this compound. This suggests that the differences observed in their physical properties may be due to different packing arrangements rather than changes in molecular conformation.",
    "We show that, in addition to gravitational waves and neutrinos, there is an additional source of energy loss during the final stages of stellar evolution which has been largely ignored by previous authors. This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect. Finally, we discuss how our results could be tested observationally using current data on distant supernovae.",
    "We study the dynamics and mechanics of single microtubules in vitro, using optical tweezers to apply forces along their length. We find that microtubules are remarkably stiff against bending but soft against stretching. The elastic response is well described by an entropic spring model with persistence length p = 1.5 mm. Microtubules can be bent into shapes such as rings or helices without breaking. When we bend them back towards straightness they relax at rates which depend on the applied tension. This suggests that microtubules have internal stresses built up during bending. These results provide new insights into how microtubules may behave inside cells where they experience both external loads and internal tensions due to motor proteins pulling on them. Microtubules (MTs) play important roles in many cellular processes including cell division [1] , intracellular transport [2] and mechanosensing [3] . They consist of tubulin dimers arranged head-to-tail into protofilaments [4] . MTs grow out of centrosomes [5] and undergo dynamic instability [6] : they switch stochastically between phases of growth and shrinkage [7, 8] .\nMicrotubules also interact strongly with motors [9] . In particular kinesin-1 [10] walks processively along the MT [11] while dyneins [12] pull on it [13] . Motors generate forces which cause MTs to buckle [14, 15] and deform [16] . It has been suggested [17] that these interactions could lead to mechanical instabilities [18] and even catastrophe [19] . However, little is known about the mechanics of individual MTs under load [20] .\nIn this Letter we use optical tweezers [21] to measure the elastic properties of single MTs [22] . We show that MTs are very stiff against bending but soft when stretched. We demonstrate that MTs can be bent into ring-like structures [23] without breaking [24] . Finally, we observe relaxation after bending [25] suggesting that MTs contain internal stresses [26] . Our experiments reveal novel aspects of MT mechanics which will help us understand how MTs respond to forces generated by motors inside living cells. \nExperimental setup.

    "We study the circular and non-circular motion near the event horizons of rotating black holes by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, which is an extension of the standard geodesic approach to include higher-order corrections due to gravitational radiation reaction effects. We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family has smaller orbital frequency than the outer one; it corresponds to bound orbits while the outer solution describes unbound orbits. For circular orbits we show how these results can be obtained directly from the first law of black hole mechanics. In addition, we also present numerical evidence showing that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) moves inward as the spin parameter increases. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results on astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks around spinning black holes. Introduction -The discovery of the first binary pulsar PSR1913+16 [1] , together with its subsequent measurement of the mass ratio between the neutron star and its companion white dwarf [2] , led to the prediction [3] that most likely all massive stars end their lives as black holes surrounded by accretion disks [4] . Since then many other observations have been made confirming this picture [5] .\nIn order to understand the dynamics of matter falling into black holes, it is important to know where particles are trapped or scattered out [6] . This information is encoded in the location of the so-called Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), i.e., the smallest possible radius r ISCO of a particle's circular orbit [7, 8] . It turns out that the value of r ISCO depends sensitively on the spin angular momentum J = Ma 2 /(2r g ) of the black hole [9] : if J < M 2 , then r ISCO > 3M ; but when J approaches M 2 , r ISCO decreases rapidly until finally it reaches the Schwarzschild radius R s ≡ 2GM/c 2 [10] . Therefore, knowing the exact position of the ISCO will help us better understand the physics behind various processes taking place close to",
    "We present the results of an extensive multi-wavelength survey of two nearby (< 1 kpc) and well-studied star-forming regions, Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), NGC 2024, in order to investigate their physical properties as well as those of individual protostars embedded within them. We have obtained near-infrared images with Subaru/Suprime-Cam at JHKs bands for ONC region and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-8.0 micron data for both regions. In addition we used archival radio continuum observations made by VLA at 6 cm and 20 cm wavelengths. Using these datasets, we performed photometry on all point sources detected above 5 sigma level in each band. By comparing our infrared photometric measurements with theoretical evolutionary models, we found that most of the objects are likely to be Class I or flat-spectrum protostellar candidates. From the analysis of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using radiative transfer modeling code, we derived the mass accretion rates onto the central stars ranging between 10-700 x10-6 Msun yr-1 .",
    "The present work is devoted to the investigation of the photothermal properties and dynamics of the Cu2O/CuO nanocomposite films prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on Si(100). The PLD technique allows one to obtain high-quality thin films with controlled composition, structure and morphology. It was found that the temperature dependence of the resistance R(T), measured at different light intensities I0, exhibits two distinct regimes corresponding to low-temperature metallic-like behavior and high-temperature semiconducting-like behavior. In addition, it has been shown that the transition between these regimes occurs via an intermediate state characterized by pronounced hysteresis effect. This phenomenon can be explained within the framework of the theory developed for semiconductor-metal phase transitions induced by strong non-equilibrium heating. We have also demonstrated that this model describes well the observed nonlinear response of the investigated system to external periodic driving force.",
    "We present the results of our theoretical study on massive planet migration in protoplanetary disks, focusing on its dependence on disk properties such as viscosity and surface density profiles. We find that the type I migration rate is strongly dependent on the disk's viscosity profile; it decreases for higher viscosities at small radii but increases again beyond a certain radius (typically 1 AU). This behavior can be explained by considering the balance between corotation torques and Lindblad torques. In addition to this effect, we also found that the mass accretion onto planets changes significantly depending on their orbital distance due to the change in gas pressure gradient across the gap opened up by the planet. Finally, we compare these theoretical predictions with recent observational data obtained using direct imaging techniques. Our results suggest that there are two possible scenarios for explaining the observed distribution of exoplanets: either they formed very close to their host stars or they underwent significant inward migration after formation.",
    "We present the first detection and characterization of infrared extinction law (IRAL) toward an extremely dark cloud core, L183. The IRAL is derived by comparing near-infrared to mid-infrared colors between background stars and foreground objects projected on the same line-of-sight through the cloud. We find that the IRAL shows no significant variation with depth into the cloud down to A V = 1000 mag. This result suggests that dust grains are not significantly modified even under such extreme conditions as those found deep inside dense clouds. Our results also suggest that grain growth may be suppressed in these environments due to efficient shattering caused by collisions among large grains. These findings have important implications for understanding the formation process of planetesimals. \n \n Keywords: Infrared extinction law, Dust properties, Interstellar medium, Shock waves \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n It has been suggested that interstellar dust grains grow up to millimeter sizes or larger within dense molecular clouds because they can survive against destructive collisions with other particles (e.g., coagulation theory; Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). However, recent observations show that there exist many small dust grains in dense regions where the gas density exceeds 10^6 cm^{-3} (e.g., Stepnik et al. 2003; Pagani et al. 2003), which contradicts this scenario. To resolve this discrepancy, it was proposed that dust grains could be destroyed efficiently via collisional fragmentation when their size becomes comparable to the mean free path of hydrogen molecules (Ormel et al. 2007). \n \n Another possibility is that dust grains do not grow but rather fragment into smaller pieces during collisions (e.g., Blum & Wurm 2008). If so, then we would expect to see some evidence of grain destruction products like sub-micron-sized fragments in dense clouds. Indeed, several observational studies reported the presence of sub-millimeter emission features attributed to silicate and/or carbonaceous materials in dense clouds (e.g., Jones et al. 1993; Chiar et al. 1998; Kessler",
    "We present the results obtained by applying the semi-analytic code VESPA to model the evolution of galaxies in the Millennium Simulation, including chemical enrichment as well as dust extinction effects on their observed properties.  We show that our models reproduce many observational trends for different types of galaxies at z=0 (e.g., luminosity functions), but also predict some new ones which can be tested with future surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In particular we find that:  - The predicted number density of massive quiescent galaxies is too high compared to observations; this problem could be alleviated if AGN feedback were more efficient than assumed here. - Our predictions are consistent with current estimates of the cosmic SFRD out to redshifts of about 4.5, although they tend to overpredict it slightly beyond that redshift. - At low masses (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) there appears to be an excess of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies in both the real Universe and in our simulations. This may indicate that either our treatment of supernova feedback and/or reionization physics needs improvement, or else that these processes have been affected by baryonic effects not included in our simulation.",
    "We present here the rigorous mathematical formulation and complete proof of our previous results on the equivalence between Ising spin glasses (ISGs) and Ising models (IMs). We show that, in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ with fixed ratio J / T , ISG partition functions can be mapped to IM ones by means of a suitable transformation which preserves all relevant physical quantities such as free energy density f = −k B T ln Z/N . The main idea is to introduce a new set of variables {s} ≡ {s1, ..., sN } representing the local magnetizations of each site i ∈ {1, .., N }, and then to map the original problem onto one where spins are coupled only through their mutual interactions. This allows us to prove rigorously that the two systems have exactly the same statistical properties when the number of sites goes to infinity. \nThe manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. II we define the model under investigation and state some basic definitions and notations used throughout this work. In Sec. III we provide the exact definition of the transformation introduced above and derive its explicit form for any finite system size N . Then, in Sec. IV, we discuss how it can be extended to infinite-size lattices. Finally, in Sec. V we give the full proof of the theorem stating the equivalence between ISGs and IMs.",
    "We consider the possibility that dark matter is made up of bosonic particles, which can condense into a superfluid state at low temperatures. We show how this scenario could explain several puzzling observations in astrophysics and cosmology. In particular we argue that: (i) The observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are explained by the presence of a halo of cold dark matter surrounding each galaxy. (ii) The formation of large-scale structures such as clusters of galaxies proceeds through gravitational collapse of overdensities in the primordial density field seeded by quantum fluctuations during inflation. (iii) Dark energy may arise naturally if the universe contains a large number of weakly interacting massive particles with masses around $10^{22}$ GeV. This article is part of a series on Quantum Matter. For more information see http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604070 . \nIntroduction:  Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict new types of elementary particles whose existence has yet to be confirmed experimentally. One particularly interesting class of models involves so-called WIMPZILLAs [1] , i.e., stable relic particles with masses around $10^9$ GeV or higher [2] . These particles would have been produced thermally in the early Universe but their abundance today should still be determined by their annihilation cross section [3] .\nIn this Letter we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of dark matter based on the idea that it consists of self-gravitating bosons [4] . Boson stars [5] are gravitationally bound states of scalar fields [6] predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model [7, 8] . They were first studied in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories [9] where they play the role of solitonic solutions [10] . More recently, boson stars have also been considered within the framework of string theory [11] . If these objects exist then they will form a population of compact remnants [12] that might constitute all or some fraction of the dark matter [13] .",
    "We present the demographics and properties of transition objects in SDSS DR7, which are defined as galaxies with both emission lines (ELGs) and absorption features (AGNs). We find that there is an excess number of ELG-AGN pairs at small separations compared to random distributions. The fraction of AGNs among all ELGs increases towards lower luminosities. There appears to be no significant difference between the fractions of AGNs found within different types of ELGs. These results suggest that some ELGs may harbor hidden AGNs. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX10AD65G. We thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments on this manuscript. In recent years, it has been shown that many active galactic nuclei (AGNs), especially those with low luminosity or obscured by dusty torii, have strong emission line components (see e.g., Ho et al. (1997) , Hao et al. (2005) ), making them appear like normal star-forming galaxies when observed through optical spectroscopic surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. (2000) ) .\nIn order to identify these \"transition objects\", we use two criteria based on their spectral energy distribution (SED): 1) they must show both emission lines (ELGs; see Section 2.1 below) and absorption features (Section 2.2) simultaneously; and 2) they should not be classified as quasars according to the BPT diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981 , Kewley et al. 2001 . By applying these selection criteria to the entire sample of galaxies in the seventh data release (DR7; Abazajian et al. 2009 ) of the SDSS, we obtain a total of 16,082 transition objects out of a parent sample of 3,962,843 galaxies.",
    "We present an argument for why quantum mechanics is nonlocal, based on the fact that it allows one to predict with certainty whether or not a measurement will be made in any given experiment. We show how this can lead to superluminal communication between two parties sharing entangled particles by using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Finally we generalize the Born rule to allow for arbitrary measurements instead of just von Neumann ones. The usual formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are performed under ideal conditions where no errors occur during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in practice there always exist some experimental imperfections such as decoherence due to environmental noise, imprecision in state preparations, and inaccuracy in measurements. In order to account for these effects, several approaches have been proposed including stochastic Schrödinger equations [1] , open systems [2] , and generalized probabilistic theories [3] . Here we consider another approach known as Quantum Bayesianism [4] .\nIn Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function is regarded as representing our knowledge about the system rather than describing its physical properties. This means that when performing a measurement, the outcome is determined by updating our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem [5] . For example, if Alice performs a measurement of spin along the x-axis on her particle, she would update her knowledge accordingly depending on what value was obtained [6] . If Bob also measures his particle's spin along the same axis but obtains different results, then he must perform a new measurement since his knowledge has changed [7, 8] .",
    "We present results of our numerical simulations of the interaction between the fast stellar winds and the slow dense shell ejected during previous eruption in the recurrent nova RS Oph (T Sco). We find that the observed X-ray light curve can be reproduced by assuming an initial mass loss rate of ~10-6 Msun/yr for the red giant component, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.  The predicted temperature structure of the shocked region agrees well with the observationally inferred one. Our model also predicts that the optical depth to X-rays should increase as time goes on because of the increasing density of the ejecta. This prediction seems to be supported by recent Swift/XRT observations. In addition we show that the observed UV fluxes are not explained by the standard steady state photoionization model but require additional heating source such as shocks or magnetic reconnection. Finally we discuss possible scenarios for future evolution of this system based on our numerical results.",
    "We study the efficiency of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration by relativistic shocks using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. We find that, for strong shocks with Mach number M = 10 - 100, only about 1% CRs can be accelerated to ultra-high energy (UHE). This is because most particles are scattered back upstream before they gain enough energy to cross the shock front again. The low efficiency of UHE particle production leads to an upper limit on the maximum proton energy as well as the total CR luminosity produced by such shocks. Our results suggest that the observed fluxes of UHE protons cannot be explained solely by diffusive shock acceleration mechanism operating at cosmological shocks. However, our findings do not rule out other mechanisms proposed recently to explain the origin of UHE cosmic rays. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic Ray Acceleration, Diffusive Shock Acceleration, Relativistic Shocks",
    "The author presents an alternative approach to teaching special relativity by using the concept of transformation groups and their generators, which are used in physics for describing symmetry properties of physical systems.  The main idea is that students can learn about the foundations of special relativity without having to deal with complicated mathematical concepts such as tensors or spinor fields. This article describes how this method works on examples related to the Lorentz transformations. It also discusses some possible applications of these ideas in other areas of physics. In particular, it shows how one can use them to explain the origin of gauge symmetries in quantum field theory. Special relativity (SR) has been taught at many universities since its discovery in 1905 [1] . However, despite numerous attempts [2] , there still exists no generally accepted way of introducing SR into undergraduate courses [3] .\nIn recent years, several authors have proposed new approaches to teaching SR [4] - [8] . These methods usually involve presenting the basic principles of SR through simple experiments performed in different reference frames [9] - [11] . They often require only minimal knowledge of mathematics [12] - [14] . Some of these proposals were inspired by Feynman's lectures [15] . Other authors tried to develop similar techniques based on modern computer technology [16] - [18] .",
    "We present new observations with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer Space Telescope to study the galaxy population in the cluster Abell 2744 at z = 0.308. We find that most of the red sequence galaxies are located on the edges of the X-ray emission peaks, while blue cloud galaxies are found mostly inside these regions. The spatial distribution of star formation rate density is also consistent with this picture. These results suggest that ram pressure stripping may be responsible for quenching star formation activity in many central galaxies. In addition, we identify several flaring galaxies which show strong [O iii]λ5007 line emissions in their spectra taken by HST/ACS grism. They have high SFRs ranging between 100 - 400 M⊙ yr−1 , but they do not appear as AGNs based on their optical colors or mid-infrared properties. Their large velocity dispersions indicate that they might be undergoing mergers.",
    "We present an analysis of the distribution of planetary orbital parameters and masses for all known extrasolar planets with measured mass (N=73). We find that this sample can be divided into three distinct groups, which we call super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and hot Jupiters. The first two are characterized by low eccentricities and high mutual inclinations between their orbits; in contrast, hot Jupiters have small mutual inclinations but large eccentricities. Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes also appear to form separate sequences on the radius-mass diagram. These results suggest that these three populations may represent different formation mechanisms or evolutionary histories. In particular, our findings support previous suggestions that super-Earths formed via core accretion followed by significant inward migration while mini-Neptunes were likely assembled through gravitational instability. Finally, we show how these results can be used as priors when searching for additional exoplanets using transit surveys such as Kepler.",
    "We present the results of our study on the possible existence and stability of terrestrial planets around the star Gliese 581, which is located at about 20 light-years away from Earth. We have performed numerical simulations for different orbital configurations of three hypothetical terrestrial planets with masses ranging between 1 to 10 times that of Earth's mass (1-10 M⊕). Our calculations show that all these systems are dynamically stable over time scales longer than 100 Myr. The most massive planet has an eccentric orbit with e=0.2 and its periastron distance ranges between 0.05 AU and 0.15 AU depending on the initial conditions used. This planet can be considered as a hot Jupiter-like planet because it orbits very close to its host star. However, we find that there exists another region where two or more terrestrial planets may exist stably. In this region, one of them could be a super-Earth-type planet with a mass larger than 5M⊕ but smaller than 8M⊕.",
    "We present the results of numerical simulations of two-dimensional N = (2, 2)\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). We use an improved action and perform calculations at several values of the coupling constant g in the range 0.1 < g < 1.0. The lattice size is 16 x 32 for all our runs except one where we used 24 x 48 sites. In order to study finite-size effects we have also performed some runs using 12 x 24 and 20 x 40 lattices. \nThe main goal of this work was to check whether the phase transition between confinement and deconfinement phases observed previously by other authors persists when the continuum limit is approached. \n \n Our data show that there are no significant differences between the results obtained on different sizes of lattices within statistical errors. This indicates that the system does not undergo any phase transitions as it approaches the continuum limit.",
    "We present spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations for the central regions (r < 1 kpc) of six nearby, massive early-type galaxies in clusters or groups with Mvir > 1013M⊙. The data were obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini North telescope as part of our ongoing program to study the formation histories of these systems. We use the pPXF code to fit the observed spectra with single-single component models consisting of an old passively-evolving population plus a younger burst superimposed at different ages and metallicities. Our main results are summarized below:  - All objects show evidence for multiple components in their line-of-sight velocity distributions.  - In all cases we find that the best-fit model consists of two distinct components: one is dominated by older stars (age>8 Gyr), while the other has intermediate age (1-8 Gyr). - For four out of six targets, the second component shows higher metallicity than the first one.",
    "We study the relic density of dark matter (DM) produced by thermal freeze-out and freezein processes in Universal Extra Dimension (UED) model, where we include effects due to Majorana mass terms for the right handed neutrino fields. We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved. In particular, if the UED scale is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies. The results are presented in the context of LHC searches for new physics beyond Standard Model. Introduction:-The discovery of the Higgs-like resonance [1-3] at Large Hadron Collider (LHC), alongwith other experimental evidences [4] , have established the existence of a fundamental scalar field responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry. However, there still remain many open questions about the nature of this scalar sector such as: What is its spin? Is it CP-even or odd? Does it couple only to gauge bosons or also to fermions? Are there any additional scalars present in Nature ? These issues will be addressed once more data becomes available from ongoing experiments like ATLAS [5] and CMS [6] . On the theoretical front, one of the most interesting possibilities is to consider extensions of the Standard Model (SM). One possibility is to extend SM into higher dimensions [7-9], thereby introducing Kaluza-Klein excitations of all particles [10] .\nIn recent years, several authors [11-13] studied the phenomenology of these theories in detail. It was shown that the lightest KaluzaKlein excitation of the graviton may act as cold Dark Matter (CDM) [14-16]. This scenario is particularly appealing since CDM constitutes around 23% [17] of the energy content of our universe [18] . Moreover, the presence of an extra spatial dimension opens up the possibility of producing Kaluza-Klein states through various production mechanisms [19-21] including decay [22] and annihilation [23] . Recently, it has been pointed out [24]",
    "We present new results on the distribution of loop widths in active regions observed by TRACE at 171 Å, using data obtained during solar maximum (May-June 2001). We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions. This suggests that the apparent constancy of loop widths may be due to averaging effects rather than being intrinsic properties of coronal structures. In addition, we show that the widths derived from observations made under different viewing angles do not depend significantly on the position angle of the line-of-sight relative to the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field vector.",
    "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an ongoing project to map the distribution and motion of galaxies, quasars, stars, and other celestial objects in space. The fourth data release was made public on September 30th 2003. This fifth data release contains more than 100,000 new quasar candidates selected by color criteria from the SDSS imaging survey. These are supplemented with about 20,000 previously known quasars that were not included in previous releases because they did not meet the selection criteria for inclusion at that time. \n \n In addition to these newly discovered quasars, this catalog also includes all quasars found during the first four years of the survey as well as those found since then but which have yet to be released publicly. A total of over 250,000 quasars are now available through this catalog. All of them have been spectroscopically confirmed using observations obtained with the dedicated 2.5-meter telescope located at Apache Point Observatory near Sacramento, California.",
    "The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revolutionized our understanding of blazar jets by providing unprecedented sensitivity to gamma rays above 100 MeV. The LAT is now routinely detecting flaring activity at GeV energies that are not seen with previous instruments such as EGRET on CGRO or AGILE/GRID. This new data allows us to probe deeper into the physics of these objects than ever before. \n \n In this talk I will discuss how we can use the upcoming generation of space-based observatories - including GLAST and EXIST - to study blazars over an even broader energy range. These missions promise to provide detailed information about the physical processes occurring within relativistic jets through observations across many decades in photon energy. We will also explore some of the exciting science questions that could be addressed using these facilities. Finally, I will present preliminary results from my recent work studying the effects of intergalactic infrared background radiation on blazar spectra.",
    "The effect of adding small amounts (0.5-2%) of the light unsaturated hydrocarbons, allene or propyne to rich methane/air mixtures is investigated experimentally in this study using counterflow diffusion flames at atmospheric pressure. The flame structure is examined with OH* chemiluminescence imaging and laser induced fluorescence measurements for CH2O and CH3O radicals. It was found that both additives have similar effects on the flame structure; they increase the flame temperature slightly but decrease significantly the maximum mole fraction of OH radical. This leads to an increased soot formation rate as evidenced by the higher soot volume fractions measured downstream of the flame front. In addition, it has been observed that the presence of these additives increases the flame speed.  These results are discussed in terms of chemical kinetic mechanisms involving reactions between hydrocarbon species and oxygen atoms. Finally, the influence of the additive concentration on the flame structure is analyzed.",
    "The physical characteristics, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and atmospheric properties of late-type dwarfs are reviewed in this chapter.  The SEDs for these objects have been measured by many authors using ground-based telescopes as well as space observatories such as ISO, Spitzer Space Telescope, and AKARI.  These observations show that the infrared flux increases with decreasing effective temperature.  In addition to their red colors, they also exhibit strong water vapor absorption bands at wavelengths longer than 2 microns.   Their near-infrared spectra reveal features due to methane gas which is abundant in their atmospheres.  They also display prominent atomic lines of potassium and sodium in their optical spectra.  Finally, we discuss how the observed photometric data can be used to determine the fundamental parameters of these objects including mass, radius, luminosity, surface gravity, age, metallicity, and distance.   ... This chapter reviews the physical characteristics, spectral energy distribution (SED) measurements, and atmospheric properties of late type dwarfs.",
    "The magnetic properties of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes have been studied extensively, but the effect on their electronic structure is still not well understood. In this work we use density functional theory to investigate how the presence of an external magnetic field affects the electronic structure of single-wall zigzag (n = 3) and armchair (n = 4) nanographenes with different sizes. We find that for small n=3 or n=4 nanographenes there are no significant changes in the band gap when applying a magnetic field up to 10 T along the tube axis. However, as the size increases, the energy gaps decrease significantly under applied fields due to the formation of Landau levels. The results show that the magnetic response depends strongly on the chirality of the nanographene. For example, while the zigzag tubes exhibit diamagnetic behavior at low fields, they become paramagnetic above 1 T. On the other hand, the armchair tubes always display paramagnetic behavior even at very weak fields.",
    "The electronic structure and transport properties of intrinsic ripples on single-layered graphene are investigated by using the tight-binding model with first-principles hopping parameters, which is based on density-functional theory (DFT). The results show that the ripple-induced local strain can lead to an energy gap opening at Dirac point for both armchair and zigzag directions. In addition, it is found that the electron mobility decreases as the amplitude increases due to the increase of scattering centers induced by the ripple structures. These findings may be useful for understanding the physical mechanism behind the experimental observations of rippling effects on the electrical performance of graphene devices. Graphene has attracted great attention because its unique two-dimensional honeycomb lattice structure leads to many novel phenomena such as high carrier mobility [1] , Klein tunneling [2] , valley polarization [3] , etc.. However, recent experiments have shown that the pristine flat monolayer graphene sheets tend to form ripples spontaneously [4] . It was also reported that these ripples could affect the electrical performance of graphene-based devices [5] .\nIn this work we investigate the effect of ripples on the electronic structure and transport properties within the framework of the tight-binding model [6] . We find that the ripple-induced strains can open up an energy gap around the Fermi level for both armchair andzigzag directions. Moreover, the electron mobility decreases as increasing the amplitude of ripples since more scattering centers are introduced into the system.",
    "We present the results for hadron production in semiinclusive DIS off nuclei at large Bjorken x and low Q^2, obtained with the HERMES experiment using data taken between 1997 and 2002. The analysis is performed within the framework of collinear factorisation and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al.. We find that the observed suppression of leading neutron production relative to deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects alone without invoking any additional mechanism such as intrinsic charm or gluon saturation. In addition we observe an enhancement of strange particle production which cannot be described by conventional partonic models but may be attributed to the presence of intrinsic strangeness in the proton wave function. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semi-inclusive deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (SIDIS) has been studied extensively over many years both experimentally [1]-[6] and theoretically [7][8][9] . This process provides information about the quark structure of the target nucleus through measurements of final state particles produced in association with the scattered lepton. At high values of Bjorken-x, where the struck quarks are highly virtual, SIDIS probes the transition region between the non-perturbative regime governed by confinement physics and the perturbative domain dominated by short-distance interactions [10] . \nIn this kinematic range it becomes possible to study the properties of bound-state systems directly via their interaction with hard probe photons [11] , thereby providing insight into the dynamics underlying the formation of composite states [12] - [14] .\nTheoretical studies have shown that the cross section for SIDIS depends strongly on the transverse momentum k_T of the outgoing hadrons [15] - [17] . It was found that the dependence of the cross sections on k_T could be used to discriminate among different theoretical approaches [18] - [20] . For example, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism [21] predict a strong increase of the cross section with increasing k_T [22] while those employing the CCFM evolution equations [23] lead to much weaker dependences [24] . \n \n 2 Experimentally measured quantities",
    "We present the discovery of two gravitationally lensed quasars, QSO B1608+656A and QSO B1608+655B (hereafter A and B), which are separated by 1.5 arcsec in projection on to the sky but have very different redshifts z = 2.7 and z = 3.6 respectively. The lensing galaxy is identified with an elliptical galaxy at redshift 0.33 located between the quasar images. We find that this system has properties similar to those found for other known gravitational lenses produced by massive clusters of galaxies. However, we show that it can be explained as being due to the lensing effect of only one cluster member -the central globular cluster of the lensing galaxy-if its mass-to-light ratio M/LV ~ 100M⊙ /L⊙ V . This value agrees well with previous estimates based on observations of Galactic globular clusters.",
    "We present results on semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS), ep -> e' p X , with an emphasis on final state interaction effects for both proton and neutron targets. We use a model-independent approach to extract information about the transverse momentum dependence of partonic distributions by studying azimuthal correlations between hadrons produced in SIDIS events. The data were collected using the HERMES experiment at DESY during 1997-2000. Final state interactions are studied through their effect on the cross section as well as on various asymmetries. For example we show that the observed cos2#h correlation is consistent with rescattering contributions involving quarks carrying only a small fraction of the target nucleon's longitudinal momentum. This result indicates that the quark sea may be more asymmetric than previously thought. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the magnitude of the rescattering contribution depends strongly on the kinematics chosen. Finally, we study the influence of FSI on the extraction of transversity distribution functions.",
    "We study the dynamics of string cosmologies with nontrivial dilaton potentials, focusing on their chaotic behavior. We show that for certain classes of potentials there are regions where trajectories can be trapped by unstable fixed points or periodic orbits. In these cases we find that the system is not ergodic but has an infinite number of attractors which correspond to different values of the Hubble parameter H(t). The existence of such attractor solutions may have important consequences for the evolution of our universe. For example, it could explain why the present value of H(t) differs so much from its initial value at t = 0. It also provides a possible explanation for the observed flatness problem since the volume V (t) grows exponentially fast during inflation while the energy density decreases as 1/V (t).\nThe results presented here were obtained using numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm combined with Newton's method for finding roots.",
    "We present integral formulas for the steady-state distribution and current in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries, which is one of the most important models to describe non-equilibrium phenomena such as traffic flow on highways or biochemical reactions at molecular motors.  We derive these results by using an exact mapping between ASEP and the totally asymmetric zero-range process (TAZRP), which can be solved exactly via matrix product ansatz. The obtained formulae are expressed only in terms of elementary functions and thus provide explicit expressions for physical quantities that have been studied so far mainly numerically. In particular, we show that our result reproduces known results for the case where particles enter and exit at both ends of the system with equal rates. Furthermore, we obtain new results for the cases where particles enter and/or exit at either end of the system with unequal rates. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (AS EP)\nis one of the most fundamental models describing nonequilibrium phenomena [1] . It describes the dynamics of interacting particles hopping along a chain of L sites under the following rules: each site i = 1, ..., L contains at most one particle; if there is no particle at site i , then it hops rightward with rate p ; otherwise, it stays still. If there is already another particle at site i , however, this particle cannot move until the first particle moves away. This model has attracted much attention because its stationary state exhibits various interesting properties depending on boundary conditions [2] .\nIn recent years, several studies have focused on the so-called open-boundary condition [3] - [8] : Particles enter into the leftmost site of the chain with probability α per unit time and leave from the rightmost site with probability β per unit time. For example, when α = β = 1/2, the stationary state becomes uniform regardless of the initial configuration [9] . On the other hand, when α > β , the stationary state shows phase separation [10] . Moreover, when α < β , the stationary state displays shock profiles [11] . These features make the AS EP a powerful tool to",
    "We have recently shown that the one-range addition theorems derived in our previous work are valid not only for the Coulomb interaction potential but also its derivatives, such as the nuclear attraction potential or the exchange potential. \n \n In this comment we show how these results can be used to derive new addition theorems for the nuclear attraction potential and the exchange potential. These new addition theorems are useful when calculating matrix elements between atomic orbitals with different angular momenta. We illustrate their application using examples involving hydrogenic wave functions. Finally, we discuss some possible extensions of these results. DOI: 10.1063/1.2055316 \n \n This is an extended version of a comment published in ChemPhysChem. DOI: 10.1002/cphc.201500420 \n \n \n \n One-range addition theorems play important roles in many areas of physics including quantum chemistry [1-3], molecular physics [4], condensed matter physics [5], etc.. They provide simple expressions for evaluating matrix elements of various potentials between two arbitrary wavefunctions.

Recently, we showed that the same approach could be applied to other types of potentials [7-9].",
    "We have studied the dependence of growth rates for collisionless magnetic instabilities (CMIs) in nonrelativistic electron-ion plasmas with Maxwellian velocity distributions, using linear kinetic theory. We found that the growth rate is strongly dependent upon the shape of the distribution function at high velocities. In particular, we find that the fastest growing mode has its maximum growth rate when the distribution function peaks near the speed of light. This result suggests that CMIs may be excited more easily than previously thought under certain conditions. \n \n The effect of solitary waves on the growth rates was also investigated numerically. It was shown that the presence of solitary waves can significantly enhance or suppress the growth rates depending on their amplitudes relative to those of background fluctuations. These results are important because they show how nonlinear effects such as solitary wave generation affect the stability properties of plasma systems. They should therefore provide useful information about the evolution of unstable plasma systems.",
    "We study spin effects on the lattice QCD using recurrence lattices (RL) with multi-site exchanges, which are constructed by applying the RL transformation to the original fermion action. We show that the spin dependence is suppressed for large quark masses but not completely removed even at mq = 5 GeV. The residual spin dependence can be reduced further if we use larger number of sites in the exchange term. In this work, we adopt Ns = 4 as an example. We also find that the spin dependent part of the effective potential has no imaginary part up to O(a^4). This implies that there exists no spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry due to spin effects within our framework. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our method. PACS numbers: 11.15.Ha, 12.38.Gc, 13 .25.Hw \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years, it was found that the standard Wilson-type fermions suffer from severe problems such as the so-called species doubling problem [1] , the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [2] , and the Gribov copy problem [3] . These difficulties have been overcome by introducing new types of fermionic actions [4] - [8] .\nThe most popular one among them is probably the overlap-Dirac operator [9] , whose eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [10] . However, its numerical cost grows rapidly when the lattice volume becomes large because the inverse of the Dirac operator must be calculated exactly. To reduce the computational costs, several approximate methods were proposed [11] - [13] . Among these approaches, the Neuberger overlap operator [14] seems to be the best choice so far [15] .\nAnother promising approach is based on the idea of the exact renormalization group [16] . It was shown [17] that the fermion determinant detD(μ), where D(μ) denotes the fermion matrix defined through the fermion action Sf [U] ≡ ∑x Tr[γμD(μ)Ux], satisfies the following flow equation:",
    "We present new results on outflow properties in quasars based on observations with Chandra, XMM-Newton, Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based optical telescopes. We find that quasar winds are ubiquitous at all luminosities probed by our sample; they have high velocities (up to 0.26c) and mass loss rates (10-100 Msun/yr). The wind kinetic power is comparable or exceeds the bolometric luminosity for most objects studied here. Winds appear to be launched close to the central black hole but can extend up to several hundred parsecs away. They show evidence for both thermal and non-thermal emission components. In addition we report on the discovery of an X-ray absorber associated with one of these winds which has been previously detected only in absorption lines seen in UV spectra. This absorber shows significant variability over timescales as short as days.",
    "We have recently shown that the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations can be obtained by solving an initial value problem for a massless scalar field in deSitter space-time, which is known as the cosmological slingshot effect (CSE). In this work we show how to match the CSE predictions with those of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3-year data release (WMAP3) and compare them against other models. We find that our model fits well within 1-sigma error bars on all parameters except n_s, where it lies just outside 2-sigma limits. The best-fit values are given by:  H_0 = 72.6 +/- 0.9 km/s/Mpc,  Omega_m = 0.26 +/- 0.01,   Omega_Lambda = 0.74 +/- 0.02,    n_s = 0.96 +/- 0.06.   These results agree very well with recent measurements made using Type Ia supernovae.  Our analysis shows that the CSE provides a viable alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic structure formation.",
    "We study evolutionary games played by agents that are randomly distributed over the nodes of an unstructured network, and interact only with their immediate neighbors in this network. We show how to compute Nash equilibria for such games using local computations at each node. Our approach is based on computing best responses locally at every agent's neighborhood, which we then use as input to a global algorithm that computes all Nash equilibria. The main technical challenge lies in showing that our local algorithms terminate after polynomially many rounds (in terms of the number of players), even though they may be executed concurrently across different parts of the network. This result holds under mild assumptions about the underlying interaction graph. In particular, it applies to any undirected connected graph where there exists some constant upper bound on the degree of its vertices. As a consequence, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for finding Nash equilibria in several classes of games including congestion games, matching pennies games, and coordination games.",
    "In this work, we present an algorithm for the analysis and comparison of profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed method is based on the concept of Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM) which has been widely used in image processing to measure similarity between two images. We use SSIM as a distance metric to compare HMMs by measuring their similarities at different levels of granularity. In addition, our approach allows us to identify regions that are responsible for differences among models. Our experiments show that the proposed method can be effectively applied to analyze and compare HMMs generated using various algorithms such as PSI-BLAST or SAM-T2K.

    "We report on high-resolution spectroscopy of the lithium-like ions C VI, N VII, O VIII, Ne IX, Mg XI, Si XIII, S XV, Ar XVII, Ca XIX, Fe XXIII, Ni XXIX observed with Chandra HETGS during an outburst of the black hole candidate Cen X-4 (Nova Muscae 1991). The measured line fluxes are used to determine the abundance ratios between different elements as well as their relative abundances compared to solar values. We find that the Li-Be-B element abundances are enhanced by factors up to 100 times solar for some lines. This is consistent with previous results obtained using ASCA data taken at lower spectral resolution. In addition we detect strong emission features due to highly ionized iron which have not been seen before in this source. These new observations allow us to study the chemical composition of the accretion disk around the compact object more accurately than previously possible.",
    "We present an improved factorization formula for the fragmentation functions (FFs) of hadrons containing one heavy quark, which is valid in both leading order and next-to-leading order QCD perturbation theory. The new formula takes into account all possible contributions to the FFs at each perturbative order. We show that our results are consistent with those obtained by using other approaches such as the operator product expansion method or the renormalization group equation approach. Finally we give numerical predictions on some important quantities related to the charm-quark FFs. PACS numbers: 12.38.Qk, 13.25.Gv, 11.15.Tk \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe fragmentation function D(z), where z = Phadron/Pquark , describes how quarks fragment into hadrons when they are produced in hard processes like deep-inelastic scattering [1] .

    "We present near-infrared photometry for brown dwarfs (BDs) with masses below 0.075 Msun, members of the young open cluster Lambda Orionis. We find that these BDs have redder J-K colors than field objects at similar spectral types. This is consistent with previous studies showing that low mass stars and BDs are more dusty than higher mass counterparts. The observed color excesses can be explained by accretion disks around the BDs. Using our data we estimate disk fractions between 20-50% among the lowest mass BDs in this sample. These results suggest that most BDs form via core accretion as do high-mass stars. However, it remains unclear whether or not all BDs accrete material to become fully fledged planets. In addition, we show that there may exist two populations of very-low mass BDs: one population which has been affected by accretion processes during its formation; another population whose properties resemble those of older field BDs.",
    "We report on the detection and analysis of an optical shock front in the supernova remnant (SNR) Tycho using data obtained with Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS). The observed spectrum shows strong emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, argon, calcium, magnesium, silicon, iron ions at wavelengths between 3200Å and 9400Å. We find that these line emissions are well reproduced by a model consisting of two components; one is a photoionized plasma component which emits forbidden lines such as [O III] λλ4959, 5007 and [S II]λλ6716, 6731, while another is a collisionally ionized plasma component which produces prominent Balmer series lines including Hα. From this result we conclude that the detected shock front is dominated by collisional ionization rather than photo-ionization. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnants",

    "We demonstrate that it is possible to generate all four Bell states in one single nonlinear crystal by using two pump beams with orthogonal polarizations and slightly different wavelengths, which are generated via second-harmonic generation (SHG) inside an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO consists of a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal as nonlinear medium and a concave mirror for cavity feedback. We show experimentally that this approach allows us to obtain high-visibility quantum interference between photons emitted at degenerate wavelength pairs across the entire PPLN acceptance bandwidth. This method can be used to simplify future experiments on continuous-variable entanglement distribution over large distances. \n \n Quantum information processing requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of light. In particular, the Bell state measurement plays a key role in many applications such as teleportation or quantum repeaters [1] . However, generating these highly nonclassical states is challenging because they require indistinguishable photon pairs [2] , which cannot be produced deterministically [3] .\nIn recent years, several approaches have been developed to overcome this problem [4] . One possibility is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), where a pump beam creates correlated pairs of signal and idler photons [5] . By adjusting the relative phases of the pump fields [6] , it has become possible to produce any desired superposition of the four Bell states [7, 8] . Another option uses squeezed vacuum states [9] or displaced number states [10] instead of coherent laser pulses [11] . These methods allow for efficient generation of entangled states but usually suffer from low visibility due to imperfections [12] .",
    "We present the first detection and characterization of polarized foreground emission at microwave frequencies using three years of data from WMAP. We find that this emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation, with an amplitude consistent with previous measurements in the literature. The polarization fraction for this component ranges between 0.5% to 2% across the sky. In addition we detect significant levels of polarized dust emission over much of the sky. This emission has a lower fractional polarization than previously reported but its total intensity is comparable or higher. Finally, we report on the detection of polarized thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect associated with galaxy clusters. These results are important as they provide new information about Galactic foregrounds which will be used to extract cosmological signals such as primordial gravitational waves. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic microwave background anisotropies, Galaxy cluster, Synchrotron Radiation, Dust Emission, Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovitch Effect",
    "The thermal Casimir force is the quantum mechanical effect that arises when two objects are separated by vacuum, which causes them to attract each other due to zero-point fluctuations in their electromagnetic fields.  In this talk I will present some recent results for the thermal Casimir force between dielectrics as well as related problems such as the van der Waals interaction between polarizable atoms or molecules at finite temperature. The first part of my talk will be devoted to an overview of our work on the subject published recently in Physical Review Letters (PRL) [1] . This includes new exact expressions for the thermal Casimir energy density and pressure valid for arbitrary temperatures and dielectric functions. These formulas can also be used to calculate the leading order corrections to Lifshitz theory [2] , which has been widely applied to describe the Casimir force between real materials [3] .\nIn the second part of my talk I will discuss how these results have been extended to include retardation effects [4] . We find that retardation leads to additional contributions to both the energy density and pressure that depend strongly on the distance between the bodies. Finally, we will show how these results can be used to study the van der Waals interactions between polarizable atoms or molecules; i.e., systems where retardation plays no role but where the dispersion forces still give rise to non-trivial behavior [5] .  For example, we will demonstrate how one can use our formalism to obtain accurate predictions for the critical point of the liquid-vapor phase transition in water [6] .",
    "The growth in stellar mass is driven by star formation, which occurs when dense gas collapses to form stars.  The rate at which this happens depends on how much gas there is available for collapse.   In turn, the amount of gas available for collapse depends on the balance between inflow (from larger scales) and outflow (from smaller scales).   This talk will discuss recent work that has been done using numerical simulations to understand these processes better. It will also present some new results on the role played by magnetic fields during star formation. Star formation takes place when dense gas clouds collapse under their own gravity into bound objects called protostars.  These protostars then grow through accretion until they reach the main sequence stage where nuclear fusion begins.  During this process, gravitational energy is released as radiation and kinetic energy, heating up surrounding material and driving powerful winds and jets.  As such, understanding what controls the rate at which stars are formed requires an understanding of how gas flows onto forming stars.  Gas can flow towards forming stars either directly or indirectly via filaments.  Directly flowing gas may be channeled along magnetic field lines while indirectly flowing gas may be transported along with turbulent motions.  Both types of flows have been observed around young stars but it remains unclear whether one type dominates over another.  Recent observations suggest that both direct and indirect flows play important roles depending on the environment.  For example, observations show that most low-mass stars accrete...",
    "The formation and characterization of bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles formed by electrostatic interaction between anionic graft copolymer poly(acrylic acid-co-methacrylamide) (PAM-g-PAA) and protein in aqueous solution are reported here. The size, shape, surface charge density distribution, zeta potential, and stability of these particles were investigated as functions of polymer concentration, ionic strength, temperature, and pH value. It was found that PAM-g-PAA/BSA nanoparticles could be prepared over wide ranges of conditions. At low pH values, the particle sizes increased slightly with increasing polymer concentrations due to the increase in intermolecular interactions among proteins. However, when the pH value reached 7.0, the particle sizes decreased significantly because of the decrease in net charges on both polymers and proteins. In addition, it is shown that the shapes of PAM-g-PAA/protein nanoparticles changed from spherical to ellipsoidal or rod-like structures depending upon the pH values.",
    "We present an explicit, physically sound formulation for the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in terms of a time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian effective potential that is derived directly from first principles and has no free parameters.  The resulting expression agrees exactly with previous results obtained by other authors using different methods but it also provides new insights into this fascinating quantum phenomenon. In particular we show how to calculate the energy spectrum of the system as well as its decay rates and lifetimes. We demonstrate our approach on two examples - one involving a single harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath at finite temperature and another where the oscillators are replaced by fermions. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of these ideas beyond the standard model of particle physics. The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE), predicted more than twenty years ago [1-3], refers to the generation of photons due to vacuum fluctuations when macroscopic objects move or change shape [4] . This intriguing prediction was confirmed experimentally only recently [5-7] , although there have been earlier suggestions [8] .\nThe original theoretical description of the DCE relied heavily on phenomenological models which were not always easy to interpret physically [9] . More recent attempts [10-12] used microscopic approaches based on non-relativistic QED [13-15] or relativistic field theory [16] . However, all such treatments involve some ad-hoc assumptions about the form of the interaction between the moving object(s) and the electromagnetic fields [17] . Here we propose a completely different method that avoids any such approximations and leads to a simple, transparent physical picture of the process.

The experiments were performed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which allows for direct observation of atomic-scale processes at surfaces. We find that, during current-induced mass transport along steps, the step edges fluctuate strongly with time. These fluctuations are characterized by an exponential growth followed by saturation after about 1 hour. In addition to this general behavior we observe different types of fluctuations depending on the applied voltage and temperature. For low voltages and temperatures below 300 K, the fluctuations show a sawtooth-like shape indicating periodic changes between two states. At higher voltages or temperatures above 400 K, the fluctuations become more irregular but still exhibit some periodicity. Finally, at high voltages and temperatures around 500 K, no regular pattern is observed anymore. Our results suggest that these fluctuations can be explained as a result of competition between diffusion and drift currents.",
    "The problem of finding the energy levels of an electron bound to a nucleus is one of the most important problems in physics, which has been studied for many years. In this article we consider the case where there are two electrons with opposite spins that can occupy different orbitals around the same nucleus. We show how to compute these states using only polynomial time computations on classical computers. This result was obtained by applying some techniques developed recently in computational complexity theory such as the PCP theorem (the probabilistic checkable proof) and the local testability of CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems). The results presented here have applications not only in theoretical physics but also in computer science. For example they provide new insights into the structure of NP-complete problems. Quantum mechanical systems play an essential role in modern physics. One of their main features is that particles may be found in superposition of several states at once. A famous example is Schrödinger's cat experiment [1] . Another feature is entanglement [2] , i.e., correlations between particles that cannot be explained classically [3] .\nIn this work we study the following problem: given a system consisting of N spin-1/2 particles, what is the ground state? That means, if all particles were measured simultaneously, what would be the probability distribution over the possible outcomes?\nWe will focus our attention on the simplest non-trivial case: two spin-½ particles occupying different orbitals around the nucleus [4] . It turns out that it is sufficient to solve this problem in order to find the ground state of any number of particles [5] .",
    "We report on the detection and analysis of radio emission associated with an impulsive solar flare that occurred in active region NOAA 10486 (SOL2010-07-20T17:48) at 17:48 UT on July 20, 2010 using the Nançay Decameter Array (NDA). The event was accompanied by a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME), which reached Earth at 18:20 UT on July 21. We find that the radio source is located near the center of the CME front as seen in white light images taken by STEREO-Ahead/EUVI 195 Å . The radio flux density shows rapid evolution during the first hour after the onset of the flare, followed by gradual decay over several hours. The radio spectrum has a power-law shape between 1 MHz to 5 GHz. The spectral index decreases rapidly below 100 MHz but remains nearly constant above this frequency.",
    "We study statistics of conductance oscillations in open quantum dots with electron-phonon interaction and dephasing time saturation at high temperatures. We show that this effect leads to appearance of new peaks in the distribution function of conductance fluctuations, which are absent for noninteracting electrons or when the dephasing time is not saturated. The positions of these peaks depend on temperature and dot size. This dependence can be used as an experimental tool for studying phonons in open quantum dots. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in transport through mesoscopic systems such as semiconductor nanowires [1] , carbon nanotubes [2] , graphene [3] . These structures have unique properties due to their small dimensions (of order 10 nm) [4] . For example, they exhibit ballistic [5] and coherent [6] transport regimes [7, 8] .\n \nIn particular, it was shown experimentally [9] that the amplitude of conductance fluctuations in open quantum dots depends strongly on temperature T and dot size L. It decreases rapidly with increasing T and decreasing L [10] . At low temperatures, the main contribution to conductance fluctuations comes from interference effects [11] . However, at higher temperatures, thermal averaging destroys phase coherence between different paths [12] . As a result, the amplitude of conductance fluctuation decreases exponentially with temperature [13] :",
    "We present measurements of galaxy clustering on scales between 1 and 100 h-1 Mpc, using data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We use photometric redshifts to select samples with different luminosities at z = 0.5-0.8. The correlation function is measured for each sample by counting pairs as a function of separation angle. We find that the amplitude of the correlation function increases strongly with luminosity over this range. This trend can be explained if we assume that more luminous galaxies are biased towards higher density regions than less luminous ones. In addition, we measure the evolution of the bias factor with redshift. Our results show that the bias factor evolves rapidly out to z ~1 but then flattens off beyond this point. These findings suggest that the growth rate of dark matter haloes decreases significantly after z ~1. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained from numerical simulations.",
    "We present an analysis of the time variation in the supernova neutrino signal observed by KamLAND, based on the results obtained with the latest version (v5) of the numerical simulation code for core-collapse supernovae developed at Garching.  We find that the simulated time variations are consistent with those observed by KamLAND within statistical errors when we take into account the uncertainties associated with the nuclear reaction rates used to calculate the energy generation rate inside the supernova envelope as well as the uncertainty in the initial conditions assumed for the simulations. The agreement between theory and experiment is improved if we assume that the central density of the progenitor star was higher than previously thought. This result suggests that future observations of gravitational waves emitted during the collapse phase may be able to provide information about the structure of the progenitor stars prior to their explosion. In addition, our study shows that the effect of convection plays only a minor role in determining the temporal behavior of the neutrino fluxes detected by KamLAND.",
    "In this work, we introduce the higher order Schwarzian derivative (HOSD) to study chaotic behavior in dynamical systems. The HOSD is defined as the second-order differential operator with respect to time variable t acting on the first-order derivatives of the state variables x(t). We show that the HOSD can be used to construct new invariant sufficient conditions of chaos by using its properties such as non-negativity and monotonicity under some suitable assumptions. In addition, it also provides an alternative way to investigate the existence of periodic orbits in nonlinear autonomous systems. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate our results. Keywords: Dynamical systems; Chaos; Periodic orbit; Nonlinearity; Higher order Schwarzian derivative. 1 Introduction Let us consider the following nonautonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nx = f(t; x; u), where f: R × Rn × Rm → Rn, (1.1) which describes many physical phenomena arising in engineering fields [1] . Here, t ∈ [0, T] denotes time; x ∈ Rn represents the state vector; and u ∈ Rm stands for control input or parameter vector. It should be noted that the function f may depend explicitly on both time t and control parameters u. For example, if one considers the motion of a particle moving along a straight line at constant speed v, then the position of the particle at any instant of time t is described by the equation x = vt + x0, where x0 is the initial position of the particle [2] .\nThe main goal of this article is to present a novel approach based on the higher order Schwarzian",
    "We study the effect of confinement on the structure and dynamics of a simple model system, namely an ensemble of N identical particles interacting via repulsive pair potentials confined in a volume V by two parallel impenetrable walls at distance L apart.  We use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the density profiles for different values of the wall separation L and particle number N . The results show that the density profile is not affected significantly when increasing the wall separation beyond a certain value which depends on both the temperature T and the particle number N .  In addition we find that the self-diffusion coefficient D decreases with decreasing wall separation but increases again if one further reduces the wall separation below some critical value depending on the temperature T .\nThe observed behavior can be explained within the framework of mode-coupling theory (MCT) using a generalized version of MCT developed recently by us [Physica A, vol. 315, no. 1, pp. 39-48, (2003), Physica A, vol. 320, no. 3, pp. 633-646, (2004)].",
    "We present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2005hj (PTF10ygu), an apparently normal-bright Type Ia supernova discovered by PTF in late March 2005 at z = 0.084. The light curve shows two distinct peaks separated by about one month with no evidence for interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. We find that this object is consistent with being a member of the class of \"normal-bright\" SNe Ia defined by Phillips et al. (1999) but has a higher peak luminosity than most members of this class. Using our own data as well as published results we estimate the distance to SN 2005hj using three different methods. All three give distances which are inconsistent with each other within their uncertainties. This may be due to systematic errors or it could indicate that there exists more than one subclass of \"normal-bright\" objects. If confirmed, these findings have important implications for cosmological studies based on SNe Ia. \n \n Keywords: Supernovae",
    "We present multimodal nested sampling (MNS), a novel algorithm that is able to efficiently explore the posterior distribution in high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those encountered when fitting complex models to observational data sets. MNS combines ideas from simulated annealing with importance sampling techniques to find the global maximum likelihood solution within a given tolerance level. We demonstrate how this method can be used on real-world problems by applying it to two different astrophysics applications: modelling the observed fluxes of gamma-ray bursts using a time-dependent model; and determining the parameters of a binary black hole merger event detected by gravitational waves. In both cases we show that our new approach outperforms existing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The code implementing these examples will be made publicly available at https://github.com/mns-method/mns-method/tree/master/examples. Multimodal nested sampling (M NS) is a novel algorithm that is capable of exploring the posterior distribution in high dimensional parameter spaces, such as are found when fitting complex models to large observational datasets. It combines ideas from simulated annealling with importance sampling techniques to locate the global maximum likelihood solution to any problem within some specified tolerance.

    "We report on the detection of an extremely rare supersoft X-ray outburst event in the transient source 1E0102. 2-7219 (=GX 354-0) with the Suzaku satellite, which was triggered by a large increase in its hard Xray flux. The duration and peak luminosity are estimated to be about 100 s and 2×1036 erg/s at 6 kpc distance, respectively. This is one of only two such events ever detected for this object. We discuss possible origins of these events based on their observed properties. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnant, Soft gamma-ray repeater, Transient source, Supersoft X-ray emission, Hard X-ray bursts \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years, several new classes of transients have been discovered through systematic searches using satellites like RXTE/ASM or Swift/BAT. These include soft-gamma repeaters (SGRs; e.g., Hurley et al. 2005), anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs; e.g., Kaspi & Beloborodov 2017) , and magnetar candidates (e.g., Rea et al. 2012) . Among them, SGRs show repeated short-duration bursts of high-energy radiation ranging from radio waves to gammarays. AXPs are characterized by persistent X-ray emissions that often exhibit periodic pulsations. Magnetar candidates also show similar characteristics as those of AXPs but lack clear evidence of periodicity. All three types of sources occasionally emit giant flares accompanied by energetic particle acceleration phenomena (e.g., Palmer 2014; Kashiyama et al. 2013 ). On the other hand, some of these objects sometimes undergo very faint outbursts lasting for hours to days. For example, SGR 0526-66 showed a series of such outbursts between 1979 and 1989 (Mazets et al. 1981; Cline et al. 1982; Kulkarni et al. 1993; Kouveliotou et al. 1998 ) while SGR 1900+14 exhibited another series of fainter ones between 1997 and 2001 .

    "We present new constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models by combining the results of two recent surveys for gravitationally lensed quasars, SDSS and CFHTLS Wide. We find that the observed number density of lenses is consistent with predictions based on cold dark matter simulations but inconsistent at more than 3 sigma confidence level if we assume a standard thermal relic WDM model with mass mX = 1 keV. This result suggests either that the current WDM scenario needs to be modified or that there are other systematic effects which have not been taken into account in our analysis. The full text can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604070v1.pdf . \nThe existence of dark matter has now been established beyond reasonable doubt through its gravitational influence on visible matter. However, despite decades of research, little else about this mysterious substance is known. In particular, it remains unclear whether dark matter consists of one particle species only - as assumed in most theoretical studies -or whether it comprises several different particles. One possibility is that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), such as neutralinos predicted within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model [1] .\nIn order to test these scenarios observationally, astronomers look for signatures of dark matter in astrophysical objects like galaxies [2] , clusters [3] and quasars [4] . A particularly promising method involves searching for gravitationally lensed systems [5] where light rays emitted by distant sources bend around intervening dark matter halos [6] . If dark matter consists of WIMPs then their masses should lie between 10 GeV/c 2 and 100 TeV/c 2 [7, 8] . For example, the recently discovered galaxy cluster Abell 2218 [9] may contain a halo made up entirely of WIMPs [10] .",
    "The zeta-function is the main object in number theory and algebraic geometry.  In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial topology.   The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.    This leads naturally to the concept of a \"quantum torus\" whose zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the corresponding QFT.   We will also discuss some recent results concerning the relation between the zeta functions of certain families of quantum tori and their associated modular forms. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been developed into a powerful tool for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level. However, many interesting questions remain open due to the difficulty of performing calculations beyond perturbation theory. One way out of these difficulties is to use ideas from mathematics such as those coming from number theory or algebraic geometry. In particular, we are interested in using the so-called \"zeta-functions\" of algebraic varieties to obtain new insights into QFTs. These objects encode important information about the underlying physics but they are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly. In my talk I'll give examples where explicit computations have been performed successfully and show how these techniques could lead to further progress in our understanding of QFTs.",
    "We study the stability properties of planar streamers in air, which are ionized regions that propagate into un-ionized gas under the influence of an applied electric field. We show how to use the so-called \"pulled front approach\" to derive a nonlinear evolution equation for the shape of such fronts and then analyze this equation using standard techniques from dynamical systems theory. In particular we find that there is a critical value of the applied voltage beyond which the planar solution becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations. This result explains why it has been so difficult to observe stable propagation of streamers at high voltages experimentally. The results presented here should be relevant not only to atmospheric discharges but also to other physical situations where similar phenomena occur, e.g., combustion flames or chemical waves on catalytic surfaces. Streamers are thin channels filled with highly conducting plasma that can form when strong electric fields are present between two electrodes immersed in non-conducting gases [1] . They have attracted considerable interest over many years because they play important roles in various applications including lightning [2] , sprites [3] , and high-voltage switches [4] .\nIn recent years much progress has been made towards understanding their formation mechanisms [5, 6, 7, 8] as well as their dynamics [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96,",

    "We report on new spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binary system HAT-TR-205-1013, which was discovered by the Hungarian Automated Telescope (HAT) survey for transiting exoplanets. The light curve shows two partial eclipses with an orbital period of 1.8 days. We find that this is most likely caused by reflection effects rather than occultation events due to the presence of a third body. Using our radial velocity measurements we determine the mass function f(m) = 0.0027 ± 0.0007M⊙, where m is the mass of the unseen companion star. Assuming circular orbits, we derive the minimum masses of both components as M1 sin i = 0.84 ± 0.04M⊙ and M2 sin i = 0.16 ± 0.02M⊙. From these values we estimate the radius ratio between the primary and secondary component as q = 0.53 ± 0.06.",
    "We present the first direct determination of the stellar radius in an interacting binary system, using interferometric observations obtained with the VLTI and AMBER instrument. We resolve for the first time the components of the close binary system SS Leporis (separation ~0.3 arcsec), which consists of two main sequence stars that are both filling their respective Roche lobes. By fitting theoretical models to our data we find that one component is slightly larger than expected by theory while the other has a radius consistent with predictions based on evolutionary tracks. This result suggests that tidal interactions have modified the radii of these stars during their evolution towards contact. Our results also show that the orbital inclination angle i = 60 ± 5 degrees, as determined previously through radial velocity measurements, agrees well with our new estimate derived directly from the observed separation between the two stars.

    "We report on the observation of ground state magneto optical resonance (GMOR) in cesium vapor confined to a sub-micron thickness layer inside a glass micro-cell. The GMOR is observed by measuring the transmission spectrum through the cell as it is rotated about its normal axis with respect to the direction of propagation of circularly polarized light. We show that this effect can be explained using simple classical electrodynamics and we present experimental results which demonstrate the dependence of the GMOR signal strength on various parameters such as the intensity, frequency detuning and polarization angle of the incident laser beam. This work opens up new possibilities for studying quantum optics phenomena at the single atom level. \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing techniques for trapping atoms or molecules within microscopic volumes [1] . Such confinement offers several advantages over conventional atomic beams experiments including increased interaction times between the trapped particles and the applied fields [2] , improved spatial resolution [3] and reduced Doppler broadening [4] . These features are particularly important when considering applications involving high precision measurements [5] .\nIn addition to these practical benefits, confining neutral matter to small dimensions also provides opportunities for exploring fundamental physics [6] . For example, the study of Bose-Einstein condensates [7, 8] requires cooling and trapping of large numbers of atoms into very tight traps [9] . Similarly, investigations into the properties of individual atoms [10] require their isolation from other sources of decoherence [11] . Finally, studies of macroscopic quantum effects [12] may benefit from the ability to control the number of particles involved [13] . \n \n Here we describe our efforts towards achieving controlled confinement of neutral matter to extremely small dimensions. Specifically, we have developed a technique for producing a thin film of cesium gas inside a glass micro-cell [14] . By exploiting the strong magnetic dipole moment associated with the cesium ground state [15] , we observe a novel form of magneto-optical resonance [16] known as ground state magneto-optical resonance [17] .

    "The WiFeS instrument is an integral field spectrograph for the Australian National University 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia.  It has been in operation since 2005 and was designed to provide high quality optical spectroscopy over a wide range of wavelengths with minimal overheads.   The WiFeS instrument consists of two cameras that are mounted on a common baseplate which sits inside a vacuum chamber attached to the Cassegrain focus of the ANU 2.3m telescope.    Each camera contains a lenslet array that produces a set of images across its focal plane.  These images can be combined into a single data cube using software developed by Dopita et al. (2007).    This data cube provides information about both spatial position and wavelength along each line-of-sight through the object being observed.  In addition to this capability, WiFeS also offers several other advantages including:  - High throughput due to the use of dichroic beam splitters and fibre optic coupling between the lenses and detectors.  - Flexible observing modes ranging from fully automated observations to manual control via remote desktop interface.  - Fast readout times allowing multiple targets to be observed simultaneously or rapid cycling between different targets during a night's observation run.  - Low maintenance requirements as it does not require any moving parts within the vacuum enclosure.  - Excellent stability thanks to the design of the optics bench and the thermal isolation provided by the vacuum enclosure.  - Large format detector arrays providing excellent signal-to-noise ratio even under poor seeing conditions.  - Robust mechanical design ensuring long-term reliability...",
    "We present an overview of the state-of-the-art methods for spectral analysis on spherical data, with emphasis on their applications to problems arising in geophysical sciences (e.g., global seismological tomography) and astrophysics (e.g., cosmic microwave background).

The main focus is on the development of new algorithms for computing accurate estimates of the power spectrum of signals defined over the surface of the unit sphere using only partial information about these signals. In particular, we consider two classes of methods: those based on the use of spherical harmonic expansions and those based on wavelet transforms. Finally, we briefly describe several open research questions related to the topic discussed here. Spherical data arise naturally in many areas of science including astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, geodesy, and medicine. For example, astronomers routinely collect large amounts of data describing the positions of celestial objects such as stars or galaxies; similarly, weather forecasters gather measurements of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., at various locations around the globe.

However, many open questions remain regarding the properties of this newly discovered state [4] , including whether it is part of a larger multiplet [5] .\nIn supersymmetry [6] , each SM field has a superpartner differing only in spin statistics [7, 8] . If R-parity [9] is conserved, then all superpartners must be produced in pairs [10] . One consequence of this scenario is that there can exist more than one Higgs doublet [11] . In particular, if the lighter scalar Higgs boson observed at the LHC [12–18] corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate h0 of such a model [19, 20] , then the next-to-lightest CP-eigenstates H0 and A0 could both couple strongly to fermions [21] . Such scenarios would lead to enhanced rates for decays of these states into final states containing photons [22] . \n \n In order to explore possible deviations from the SM predictions [23] , precise measurements of the masses and couplings of the Higgs bosons predicted by",
    "Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic devices due to their unique electronic properties and high carrier mobility at room temperature. However, the scaling behaviors of GNRFETs have not been fully understood yet because of the difficulty in simulating realistic device structures with atomistic details using conventional approaches such as density functional theory or tight-binding method. In this work, we perform large-scale quantum transport simulations on GNR-FETs by solving the nonequilibrium Green's function equations within an effective mass approximation. We find that the subthreshold swing decreases rapidly when the channel length is reduced below 10 nm while it increases slowly beyond 20 nm. The ON/OFF current ratio also shows similar trends but its value becomes saturated around 100 nm. These results suggest that the optimal channel length should be between 10-20 nm depending on the required performance parameters. Our findings can provide useful guidelines for designing practical graphene-based transistors.",

These include searches for sterile neutrinos, lepton flavor violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay, CP violation effects in leptonic sector, and exotic Higgs bosons that can couple to both quarks and leptons. We also discuss possible improvements in sensitivity which may be achieved if we combine the data taken at T2K and NOvA experiments.

    "The statistical mechanics of time-independent non-dissipative nonequilibrium states is studied in the framework of generalized entropy production and fluctuation theorem. The main results are formulated for systems with discrete energy levels, but they can be extended to continuous spectrum as well. It is shown that the probability distribution function (PDF) of the total entropy production has an exponential tail at large values of entropy production. This result agrees with recent experimental data on PDFs of heat fluxes between two reservoirs connected by a single molecule junction. In addition it is demonstrated how this approach allows one to calculate the average value of the total entropy production and its fluctuations. Finally we discuss possible applications of these results to transport phenomena in molecular junctions. We show that our theory predicts correctly the dependence of the current-voltage characteristics on temperature difference between the leads. Statistical mechanics of time independent non-dissipative non-equilibrium states is studied within the framework of generalized entropy-production and fluctuation theorem. Main results are formulated for systems having discrete energy-levels, however extension to continuum spectra is also discussed.

    "Spin echoes are observed when the spin system is subjected to two successive radio-frequency (RF) pulses separated by an interval, known as the pulse separation time Tsep. The first RF pulse creates a macroscopic magnetization vector M0 that precesses around the external magnetic field Bext at Larmor frequency fL = γBext where γ is gyromagnetic ratio for nuclear spins. After the second RF pulse with flip angle θ2 and phase shift φ2 relative to the first one, the transverse component of the magnetization vector M2(t) decays exponentially due to dephasing caused by local magnetic fields created by neighboring nuclei. In this work we show how strong π-pulses can be used to generate spin echoes even if there is no net initial magnetization present before applying these pulses. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that such spin echoes originate intrinsically from the dipolar interactions between nuclear spins.",
    "We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetorotational collapse (MRC) in primordial stars with initial masses between 100 and 1000 M⊙, which are formed at redshifts z = 20 − 30. We find that for all models considered here, magnetic fields play an important role during the formation process of black holes. The final mass of the central object is determined by the strength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields (B < 10^10 G), we obtain stellar-mass black holes; while for stronger fields (B > 10^{10}G), supermassive black holes form. In addition to this effect on the final mass, magnetic fields also affect the angular momentum distribution inside the collapsing star. This leads to different spin parameters of the resulting black hole depending on its progenitor's initial mass. \n \n Keywords: Black Hole, Primordial Star Formation, Magnetohydrodynamics",
    "We study the decay amplitudes for charmless hadronic B decays into a scalar meson and an axial-vector or tensor meson in the framework of QCD factorization with generalized form factors at large recoil.  We find that, although the branching fractions are small due to the helicity suppression, these processes can be used as probes of new physics beyond the Standard Model through their CP asymmetries. \nPACS numbers: 11.15.Tk, 12.38.Qk, 13 .25.Hw \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nIn this work we will consider the following two types of charmless hadronic:  B → S V (S = P , A 0 ;V = T 1 )andB → SV(S=P;V=A1). The first type is characterized by one light quark in the final state while the second has no light quarks in it. In both cases there is only one spectator quark which leads to a helicity suppression of the corresponding decay rates. However, they may still serve as useful probes of new physics since their CP-violating asymmetries could be enhanced significantly compared to those of other modes [1] .\nTheoretically, such decays have been studied within various approaches including naive factorization [2] , perturbative QCD [3] , soft-collinear effective theory [4] , and QCD factorization [5] - [8] . It was found that the predictions based on different methods differ substantially among themselves. For example, using naive factorization, Ref. [2] predicted Br(B − →K * 0 π − )/Br(B − →Kπ)=0.27 ±0.04, whereas Refs. [6, 7] obtained values around 0.1−0.2. This discrepancy indicates that more theoretical efforts should be made before drawing any definite conclusion about these decays.",
    "We study the phenomenology of string compactifications with large extra dimensions, focusing on supersymmetric particles in the mass range accessible to current experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider two classes of models that are motivated by recent developments in string theory: weakly coupled heterotic orbifolds and strongly coupled Type IIB orientifold constructions. In both cases we find that there is an interesting interplay between the Kaluza-Klein excitations associated with the extra dimensions and the lightest Standard Model superpartners. For example, in some regions of parameter space it may be possible to produce gluinos or squarks directly via Drell-Yan processes; alternatively, these states can decay into lighter Standard Model superpartners which then cascade down to the LSP neutralino. The resulting collider signatures depend sensitively on the details of the underlying model parameters as well as the number of extra dimensions.",
    "We present an algorithm for consistent hypothesis testing in which we consider all possible hypotheses that are compatible with some given set of observations, and select those that maximize their posterior probability according to Bayes' theorem.  We show how this can be done efficiently by using dynamic programming techniques. The resulting algorithm is optimal up to constant factors under certain conditions. Our approach also allows us to reason consistently over multiple experiments performed sequentially or simultaneously. This problem has been studied extensively in statistics but only recently in artificial intelligence (AI). In AI it was first considered as part of the PAC learning framework where one seeks algorithms that learn concepts from examples while making few mistakes. However, these approaches do not provide any guarantees when there exists more than one concept that fits the data equally well. In contrast our method provides provable guarantees even if several hypotheses fit the data equally well. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through two applications:  1) A new algorithm for finding explanations in probabilistic databases; 2) An improved algorithm for identifying protein families based on sequence alignment.",
    "We present the catalog of host galaxies used by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) to search for gravitational waves associated with compact binary coalescences, including black hole-neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries.  The catalog contains information on all known host galaxies within the sensitivity volume of the first-generation Advanced LIGO detectors during their initial science runs between September 2005 and January 2010. We provide positions, redshifts, distances, and references for each galaxy. This is an update to our previous publication [1] . \nThe data are available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5481.

    "We study the quantum noise properties of gravitational wave detectors with signal recycling mirror (SRM). We show that, for an interferometer with SRM, there is no fundamental limit on its sensitivity at high frequencies due to vacuum fluctuations. The shot-noise limited sensitivity can be improved by increasing the circulating power inside the cavity formed between the two arms of the detector. This improvement comes at the expense of increased thermal noise associated with the mirrors forming this cavity. In addition we find that the effect of radiation pressure noise depends strongly on whether or not the input test mass is suspended. Finally, we discuss how these results may be used to improve existing designs of advanced LIGO-like detectors. PACS numbers: 04.80.Nn, 95.35.+d, 98.80.Cq Quantum noise limits the performance of current generation ground-based gravitationalwave detectors such as Advanced LIGO [1] . These detectors are based on Michelson-interferometric configurations which use Fabry-Perot cavities to enhance their sensitivity [2] . However, it has been shown recently [3] , using semi-classical analysis, that the shot-noise limited sensitivity of these detectors cannot be further improved beyond certain frequency range without introducing additional technical noise sources into the system. It was also suggested [4] that one way to overcome this problem could be to introduce another mirror called \"signal recycling\" mirror (SRM) into the optical path of the interferometer. Using this approach, it should be possible to increase the circulating power within the interferometer while keeping the same level of shot-noise limited sensitivity achieved before adding the SRM.",
    "We study non-commutative Donaldson–Thomas invariants for Calabi-Yau threefolds in terms of their crepant resolutions, which are called conifolds. We show that these invariants can be computed by counting holomorphic curves on the resolved spaces with suitable boundary conditions. As an application we compute the Donaldson–Thomas invariant of the quintic threefold using its crepant resolution as well as the mirror quintic. The results agree with those obtained previously via other methods. This work is motivated by the recent progresses made in understanding Gromov-Witten theories through the use of symplectic field theories (SFTs). In particular, it has been shown recently that SFTs provide a natural framework to define Gromov-Witten invariants of singular varieties such as orbifolds or Deligne-Mumford stacks. However, there have not yet been any attempts to generalize this approach beyond Gromov-Witten theory.",
    "We present new observations and analysis of the neutral hydrogen (HI) disks surrounding isolated galaxies, using data obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA). We have observed 12 nearby galaxies at 21 cm wavelength to determine their total HI mass and distribution within the optical disk. The sample includes both late-type spirals and dwarf irregulars. Our results show that all but one galaxy has an extended HI halo beyond its optical radius; this is true even for the most gas-rich systems such as NGC 4254 and NGC 5253. In addition, we find evidence for significant amounts of atomic gas outside our detection limits which may be associated with tidal features or other interactions between these galaxies and neighboring companions. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that many isolated spiral galaxies contain large quantities of cold interstellar medium distributed over several kiloparsecs. \n \n Keywords: Atomic Hydrogen, Galaxy Evolution, Spiral Structure",
    "The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an alternative approach for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, which has been widely used due to its advantages over traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element approaches.  In this work we present a new LBM scheme that can be applied to high-speed compressible flows with high Reynolds number by using multiple relaxation times (MRT). The MRT-LBM solves the discrete velocity model (DVM), where each distribution function represents one component of the macroscopic variables at different velocities on a regular grid. We use the D2Q9 DVM to solve the two-dimensional incompressible flow problems. To validate our proposed algorithm, several benchmark tests are performed including lid-driven cavity flow, Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, Taylor-Green vortex flow, and shock wave propagation through a channel. Our results show good agreement between the numerical solutions obtained by the MRT-LBM and those reported previously in literature.",
    "We present new observations of the distant galaxy cluster RX J1117.4+07431, which was discovered in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey data by Voges et al. (1999) . The cluster is located at redshift z = 0.485 ± 0.001 with an estimated mass M500 = 1.7 × 1013 h-1M⊙ within r500 = 2.1h-1Mpc . We have obtained deep optical images using Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope to study its member galaxies. In addition we observed this cluster with Chandra ACIS-I for about 50 ks. Our results are as follows:  -The color-magnitude diagram shows that there exists a red sequence of early-type galaxies down to our limiting magnitude RAB=25 mag.  -From the photometric redshift analysis, we find that the number density profile of the member galaxies follows well the NFW model prediction up to 3 virial radii. -The temperature map derived from the Chandra observation reveals two hot spots near the center of the cluster. These features may be associated with shock heating due to merging activity between sub-clusters or groups.",
    "We present new spectroscopic data for the galaxy cluster Abell115 (z=0.084) obtained with the VLT/FORS2 instrument in order to study its dynamics and mass distribution. We have observed 23 galaxies within an aperture radius of 1 Mpc centered on the brightest cluster member, which is also the central dominant galaxy. The velocity dispersion profile shows no significant variation across the whole region covered by our observations. This result suggests that Abell115 has not experienced any major merger event since z=1.5-2.0. Using Jeans models we find evidence for a dark matter halo extending out to at least 3 times the virial radius. From this analysis we derive a total mass of 2.1(+0.7-0.6)x10^14M_sun inside a sphere of radius R200=850kpc. Finally, using weak lensing measurements we estimate a mass-to-light ratio of about 400h/M_luminosity_Solar_Unit.",
    "In this thesis, we study power control problems in cellular mobile radio systems with code division multiple access (CDMA). We consider the uplink scenario where each user transmits to its base station using an orthogonal spreading sequence and all users share the same frequency band. The objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual quality-of-service constraints at each user's receiver. In order to obtain tractable results, we make use of tools from stochastic geometry which allow us to model the locations of both mobiles and interferers as point processes. Our main contributions are summarized below.  First, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability when the number of active users grows without bound. These expressions can be used to determine how many users can simultaneously communicate reliably over the network. Second, we propose distributed power control schemes that achieve these limits asymptotically under certain conditions. Third, we develop centralized power control algorithms that guarantee performance close to optimality even if only partial information about the channel gains or interference levels is available. Finally, we present simulation results illustrating our theoretical findings.",
    "We study the statistical properties of simulated dark matter halos in cosmological N-body simulations, focusing on their shapes and orientations with respect to each other. We find that these quantities are strongly correlated for pairs of halos separated by less than one virial radius (the region within which the density is roughly constant). This correlation persists even when we consider only those pairs whose mutual separation lies along the line-of-sight between them. The correlations can be understood as arising due to tidal forces exerted by neighboring halos. In particular, we show that the distribution of halo shapes depends sensitively upon whether or not they lie close to an axis of symmetry of the local gravitational potential field. Finally, we compare our results against observations of galaxy clusters obtained using weak lensing techniques. Our analysis suggests that the observed cluster morphologies may provide useful constraints on the nature of primordial fluctuations responsible for structure formation in the universe.",
    "We investigate whether we can detect anisotropy in quasar H II regions during reionization through their small-scale redshifted 21 cm power spectrum (21-cm PS). In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Strömgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field. By performing numerical simulations for different values of the spin temperature T S , we find that the 21-cm PS has a characteristic peak structure which reflects the shapes of individual H II regions. This peak structure becomes more prominent as T S decreases because the number of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the decrease in the brightness temperature difference between the CMB and the 21-cm emission line. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use this peak structure to constrain the value of T S . However, since there exist many other factors affecting the 21-cm PS besides T S , further studies will be needed before drawing any conclusions on its detectability.",
    "We study the dynamics of two interacting bosonic species confined to an optical lattice, with one species being initially prepared as a coherent state at each site while the other is initially prepared as a thermal cloud. We show that this system supports both symmetric and asymmetric soliton solutions which are stable against small perturbations for certain values of the chemical potentials. The stability properties of these solitons can be understood by studying their linearization spectrum around the stationary states. In particular we find that the presence of a finite temperature leads to additional unstable modes associated with phonon-like excitations. Finally, we demonstrate how our results may be used to describe experiments on spinor condensates loaded into optical lattices. Introduction:-Recent experimental advances have made it possible to create quantum degenerate gases consisting of several different atomic species [1] . These systems provide new opportunities to explore novel phenomena such as supersolids [2] , phase separation [3] or spin-orbit coupling [4] .\nIn this work we consider a particularly interesting example where there exist two distinct types of particles (e.g., atoms) which interact via s-wave scattering but differ in mass and/or internal structure [5] . This situation arises naturally when considering mixtures of hyperfine states [6] or isotopes [7, 8] within the same atom type [9] . For instance, recent experiments involving 87 Rb and 41 K [10] have demonstrated the formation of a mixture of two different hyperfine states after evaporative cooling [11] . Another possibility would involve using 40 K and 6 Li [12] . Here, the lighter species could be considered as impurities immersed in a background gas of heavier fermions [13] . Alternatively, if the masses were reversed then the heavy species could act as impurities [14] .",
    "We consider an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with multiple paths, each having different delay and gain coefficients. We assume that these channels are sparse; i.e., there is only one path whose gain coefficient exceeds some threshold value. The capacity region for this class of channels has been studied by several authors under various assumptions on the number of paths and their gains.  In particular, it was shown recently that if all the paths have equal power then the capacity region can be achieved using superposition coding at transmitter and successive decoding at receiver. However, when the powers of the paths vary widely, the optimality of such schemes remains unknown. In this work we show that even though the optimal scheme may not use superposition coding or successive decoding, its performance cannot differ significantly from those schemes. More specifically, we prove upper bounds on the gap between the achievable rates using any scheme and the sum-capacity of the channel.",
    "We study one-way permutation families with respect to their ability to resist certain attacks by adversaries that are computationally restricted in the sense that they can only perform limited number of queries to the permutation family. We show how this notion relates to computational complexity theory and present several new results on the topic. In particular we prove that any one-way permutation family is resistant against an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack if it resists a non-adaptive one. This result implies that for every one-way permutation there exists another one-way permutation which is secure under both types of attacks simultaneously. Finally, we introduce a novel concept called distortion measure between two one-way permutation families and use it to derive lower bounds on the security parameters required to achieve resistance against different classes of attacks.

    "We present the results on galaxy population in the most massive supercluster, SCl 126 (Abell 1689), based on spectroscopic data obtained with VLT/VIMOS and Keck/DEIMOS telescopes. We find that galaxies are distributed along filaments which connect clusters at different redshifts. The fraction of blue galaxies increases towards lower redshift, while the fraction of early-type galaxies decreases. This trend is more pronounced for bright galaxies than faint ones. In addition to this general picture we also detect some interesting features such as an excess of late-type galaxies around Abell 1689A cluster or a lack of bright galaxies between Abell 1689B and C clusters. These findings suggest that there may be significant differences among galaxy properties within individual clusters depending on their location relative to other structures. Our analysis shows that the observed trends can not be explained by simple passive evolution of stellar populations but require additional mechanisms like mergers and/or interactions.",
    "We present the discovery and characterization of two \"hot Jupiter\" planets orbiting stars that are members of wide binaries, HD 196885AB (a = 1.8 AU) and HD 208598AB (a = 3.6 AU). The planet around HD 196885A is an inflated gas giant with M sin i = 0.88 MJup and P = 4.3 days; it orbits its primary at a distance of only 0.04 AU. We find no evidence for additional companions to either host star down to masses as low as 5 MJup within separations of 10 AU. Both systems have orbital eccentricities consistent with zero. These results suggest that hot Jupiters can survive close encounters with other stars during their formation or early evolution.  - Introduction \n \n Hot Jupiters are massive gaseous planets on short-period orbits about solar-type stars. They represent one of the most extreme environments in our Solar System, but they may be common among nearby Sun-like stars. In fact, recent surveys indicate that roughly 20% of sun-like stars harbor such planets . However, these planets are thought to form beyond several AU before migrating inward through interactions with the protoplanetary disk and/or gravitational scattering by other bodies. This raises questions regarding how these planets manage to avoid being ejected into interstellar space after undergoing strong dynamical interactions with other objects while still retaining sufficient angular momentum to reach their current locations near their parent stars .\n\nIn this Letter we report the detection of two new \"hot Jupiter\" planets using high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained over more than eight years with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher instrument (HARPS), which is installed on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-m telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. One of these planets has an extremely small semi-major axis of just 0.04 AU, making it one of the closest known exoplanets to its parent star.",
    "We study the evolution of magnetized, rotating flows in the presence of strong magnetic fields and rotation using 3D numerical simulations with ideal MHD equations. We find that when the initial flow is dominated by toroidal field lines (Btor/Bp = 0.5), it becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations at t ~ 1.2P0/c where P0 is the initial pressure scale height. The instability leads to the formation of helical structures which are similar to those observed in many astrophysical systems such as protostellar disks or AGN accretion disks. In addition we also observe another type of instability for initially poloidal-dominated flows (Btor/Bp < 0.1) which develops into an axisymmetric spiral structure. This instability can be understood as a Rossby wave instability driven by differential rotation between the disk and the corona. Finally, we show that these two types of instabilities lead to different observational signatures.",
    "The article is devoted to the problem of possible existence of dark matter particles in our Galaxy, which are not detected by other methods than their gravitational effects on visible objects (stars). The author considers the possibility that these hypothetical particles can be described as celestial mechanics daemons with certain properties. In particular, it is shown how such daemons could explain some features observed recently for the DAMA experiment at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. It should be noted that this explanation does not contradict any known experimental data. However, there are also serious difficulties associated with the proposed model. These problems will require further study. This work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant No 14-50-00040. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5189 . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK .\nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most important mysteries of modern physics [1] - [4] . Its presence has been established only indirectly through its gravitational influence on visible stars [5] , galaxies [6] , clusters [7] etc., but direct detection experiments have so far failed [8] - [10] . There exist many theoretical models describing DM [11] - [13] ; however, none of them has yet been confirmed experimentally [14] . One of the possibilities is that DM consists of new elementary particles [15] - [17] . If they interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter then they would escape detection even if they were produced in large quantities [18] . On the other hand, if they interact strongly enough with normal matter, then they may be detectable directly [19] - [21] . A number of experiments searching for DM particles have been carried out [22] - [26] . Recently, the results obtained by the DAMA collaboration [27] attracted considerable attention [28] - [30] . According to these results, the annual modulation effect [31] - [33] caused by the motion of Earth around Sun [34] - [36] leads to an increase in the rate of nuclear recoils registered by detectors during June-October period [37] compared to December-February period. Such behavior cannot be explained within Standard Model of particle interactions [38] - [41] . Several authors suggested different explanations based on",
    "The following is an excerpt from the author's thesis, which can be downloaded at http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5189. \n \n The formula evaluation problem for propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has been studied extensively and many efficient algorithms have been developed. However, most existing approaches are not suitable for evaluating large CNFs with millions or even billions of clauses due to their high computational complexity. In this work we present two novel techniques that significantly improve the efficiency of CNF formula evaluators: one based on parallelization using GPUs and another based on data compression by representing each clause as a bit vector instead of a set of literals. We implemented these techniques into our new software package called CLEVER-CNF, which outperforms state-of-the-art solvers such as SATzilla and Lingeling when evaluated against several benchmark sets including those used in recent SAT competitions.",
    "The composition of cosmic rays is studied by measuring their energy spectrum and mass distribution at Earth. The most precise measurements are obtained using ground-based detectors, which measure extensive air showers produced in interactions between cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei. In this work we present results on the measurement of shower depth profiles as well as several composition sensitive observables derived from them. These include the number of muons per meter water equivalent (N_m), the fraction of muons to electrons at 1000 m above sea level (f_1000) and the average logarithmic mass ln(A). We compare these results for different zenith angles and energies. For primary particles heavier than protons, f_1000 increases while N_m decreases with increasing zenith angle. This effect can be explained by the fact that heavy primaries interact higher up in the atmosphere where they produce more muons but fewer electrons compared to lighter primaries. At lower energies there seems to be an excess of events with low values of N_m and high values of f_1000 indicating a possible contribution from light primaries such as helium or nitrogen.",
    "The spin transistor is an important device for future quantum information processing and communication technologies, but its realization in practice has been challenging due to the lack of suitable materials with large spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we propose that graphene can be used as such material by exploiting its unique electronic structure. We show how this leads to a novel type of spin transistor which operates at room temperature without external magnetic fields or applied gate voltages. The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic contacts connected via a single layer of graphene. By applying a voltage between these contacts one can control the SOC strength in the graphene channel leading to a change in the transmission probability through it. This results in a switching behavior similar to conventional transistors. In addition, our analysis shows that the proposed device exhibits high on/off ratios even when operating under realistic conditions. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of the proposed device. Graphene is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics because of its unique electronic properties [1] . It offers the possibility to realize devices based on pure spin currents [2] , which are not limited by Joule heating effects [3] .\nIn particular, the spin Hall effect [4] allows for efficient generation [5] and detection [6] of spin currents using only electric fields [7, 8] . However, despite many theoretical proposals [9] , there have so far been very few successful attempts to experimentally demonstrate spintronic devices based on graphene [10] . One reason might be the difficulty to find appropriate materials with sufficiently strong spin-orbit interaction [11] . Another problem is related to the fact that most experiments were performed at low temperatures [12] where thermal fluctuations limit the performance of spintronic devices [13] .",
    "The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is an accelerator complex located in Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. The main goal of this facility is to study nuclear matter under extreme conditions by colliding heavy ions with high energies and studying their properties after the collision. In addition, it also provides opportunities for other experiments using different beams such as protons or photons. This talk will present recent results on the measurement of spin structure functions g_1(x) and g1p(x), longitudinal double-spin asymmetries A_L, transverse single-spin asymmetry A_T, and transversity distributions h_1/T(x).

    "We present new results on thermal inertia measurements of NEAs based on infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). We use these data to derive an improved estimate of the mean value of the surface thermal inertia, I = 100 ± 50 J m-2 s-1/2 K-1, which is in good agreement with previous estimates obtained by other authors using different methods. The derived values are also consistent with laboratory experiments performed at high temperatures that show how the thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. Using our measured range of thermal inertias we calculate the expected range of magnitudes of the Yarkovsky force acting upon NEAs. Our calculations suggest that this force may be responsible for driving some NEAs into orbits crossing Earth's orbit. This would have important consequences for future space missions aimed at deflecting potentially hazardous objects away from Earth. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) represent a significant threat to human civilization because they can impact the Earth within one million years. In order to mitigate such threats it will be necessary to develop technologies capable of deflecting or redirecting NEAs out of their current orbits before they hit the Earth. One possible method involves applying a small impulse to the asteroid's trajectory through the action of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends critically on the ability to predict accurately the strength of the YORP effect.",
    "We present the results obtained with a new approach to nuclear fusion, which combines the advantages of both microscopic and macroscopic models. The method is based on an extension of the statistical Hauser-Feshbach theory that includes the effects of nuclear structure in the form of single-particle level densities and transmission coefficients calculated within the framework of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. We apply this formalism to calculate cross sections for neutron-induced reactions on nuclei near the doubly-magic 132Sn nucleus. In particular we study the influence of pairing correlations on the fusion process by comparing our results with those obtained using the standard HFB+BCS approach. Our calculations show that the inclusion of pairing correlations leads to significant changes in the predicted fusion probabilities as well as in the corresponding astrophysical S-factors. These differences are particularly pronounced when considering heavy-ion collisions at low incident energies below the Coulomb barrier. \n \n Keywords: Nuclear fusion, Statistical model",
    "We report on the first simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) during an active state of the Galactic black hole candidate GRS 1915+105, which is known to show strong variability at all wavelengths. We find that there are two parallel tracks in the evolution of the source's luminosity between the near-infrared (NIR), optical/UV, soft/hard X-ray bands as well as radio wavebands. The NIR-optical track follows closely the hard X-ray light curve but lags behind by about 20 days; while the UV-X-ray track shows no lag compared to the hard X-ray light curve. This suggests that different physical processes may be responsible for these two tracks. In addition, we also found evidence for a hysteresis effect in both tracks. These results provide new insights into the physics of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes.",

    "We present an algorithm for obtaining the spacetime metric from observational data, such as those obtained by the Planck satellite and other experiments. The method is based on the fact that in general relativity (GR) the Einstein field equations are equivalent to the geodesic equation for test particles. We use this equivalence to obtain the metric tensor components directly from the observed trajectories of photons emitted at different redshifts. This approach allows us to reconstruct the full four-dimensional geometry of space-time without assuming any particular model or parametrization. In order to demonstrate our technique we apply it to simulated data generated using the publicly available code CAMB. Our results show that the recovered metric agrees well with the original one used to generate the mock data. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our method to real astrophysical datasets. Cosmology has entered into precision era thanks to recent advances in experimental techniques which have allowed astronomers to measure many important quantities related to the evolution of the universe. Among these measurements there are the temperature anisotropy power spectrum measured by WMAP [1] , PLANCK [2] and SPT [3] satellites; the baryon acoustic oscillations detected through galaxy surveys [4] ; and the luminosity distance-redshift relation inferred from type Ia supernovae [5] . These new data provide unprecedented opportunities to study fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model [6] .\nIn addition to providing accurate measurements of various physical parameters describing the state of the universe today, modern cosmological experiments also allow us to probe its large-scale structure over time [7, 8] . For example, the measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation provides information about the early stages of the universe's history when the energy density was dominated by dark matter and radiation [9] .

We find that the fraction of X-ray luminous AGNs increases with redshift, but decreases with cluster mass. The LF of AGNs is well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff above Lx = 1043 erg s-1 Hz-1 . The best-fit parameters are consistent with those found for field AGNs within their uncertainties. These results suggest that AGNs play important roles in heating intracluster gas as well as regulating star formation activities in clusters.

    "In this work, we propose an efficient direct-voting scheme to provide data fusion assurance (DFA) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed DFA scheme is based on the concept that each node can directly vote its local decision with other nodes' decisions and then obtain final global decision by majority voting rule. In order to reduce communication overheads caused by direct voting process, our scheme adopts two novel techniques: 1) only one-hop neighbors are allowed to cast their votes at any time instant; 2) all nodes use different time slots to transmit their votes simultaneously. We also present theoretical analysis to show how much energy consumption will be saved compared with existing schemes. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and power efficiency.

    "The missing satellites problem (MSP) is one of the most important problems in space science and technology, with applications ranging from satellite navigation to space debris removal.  The MSP asks for all orbits that are stable under gravitational perturbations by known bodies such as planets or asteroids.   In this work we present an algorithm which solves the MSP exactly on any number of dimensions d >= 2 using only O(n log n + m log n) time where n = |S| is the total number of objects in S and m = |E| is the number of edges in E.   Our approach uses a novel combination of techniques including fast matrix multiplication algorithms, data structures based on interval trees, and efficient graph traversal methods. We also show how our results can be used to solve related problems like finding the minimum distance between two given sets of points in R^d. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our method through experiments performed on real-world datasets.",
    "We report on the polarization dependent photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering spectra of CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots in solution at room temperature. The PL spectrum shows that the emission is polarized along the direction perpendicular to the excitation light, which can be explained by the selection rules for dipole transitions between electronic states with different angular momenta. In addition we observe an anisotropic broadening of the Stokes linewidths as well as a splitting into two components when exciting circularly polarized light. These effects are attributed to the presence of exciton fine structure due to spin-orbit coupling. We also find evidence for a strong electron-phonon interaction leading to phonon sidebands in both the Stokes and anti-Stokes parts of the Raman spectrum. Finally, we show how these results can be used to determine the orientation of individual QDs embedded in a polymer matrix. Polarized luminescence measurements have been performed on single QD emitters using confocal microscopy.",
    "We report on deep near-infrared observations with VLT/VISIR, which reveal that the X-ray source NGC 300 X-1 is associated with an infrared point-like object (X-ray counterpart) at RA = 03h45m55s.6 DEC = -27d19'59.9\" (J2000), located in the central part of the galaxy's spiral arm. The observed fluxes are compatible with those expected for a WR star with T eff ~ 50 kK and log g ~ 5.5-6.0. We also find evidence for extended emission around this source, possibly due to dust heated by the stellar wind or radiation field. Using our VISIR data we estimate the total number of WR stars in NGC 300 as NWR = 1.1 x 10^7 ± 0.3 x 10^7 per M_sun. This value agrees well with previous estimates based on HST/ACS imaging and spectroscopy. \n \n \n \n Keywords: Wolf-Rayet stars",
    "We present new models for non-abelian string networks, which are based on the idea that the network is composed by many entangled strings with different velocities and orientations. We show how to construct such velocity-dependent models in terms of Feynman diagrams. In particular we consider two types of diagrams: (i) ladder-like diagrams corresponding to the exchange of gluons between pairs of strings, (ii) cross-ladder like-diagrams describing interactions among three or more strings. The latter type of diagrams can be interpreted as representing junctions where several strings meet at one point. We discuss some properties of these models and compare them with previous results obtained within the framework of Abelian-Higgs model. Finally, we study numerically the evolution of an initial configuration consisting of a single straight string into a complicated tangle of interacting strings using Monte Carlo simulations.

    "We present the results of an investigation into the properties and evolution of transients that arise when initial conditions are generated using Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) for cosmological N-body simulations. We find that LPT-based initial conditions produce spurious large-scale power at late times, which is not suppressed by increasing the number of particles used to generate these initial conditions. This effect can be mitigated by applying a low-pass filter to the evolved density field prior to generating new initial conditions with higher-order LPT. However, this approach does not completely remove all unwanted effects associated with the use of LPT-generated initial conditions. In addition, we show how the choice of time step used to evolve the initial conditions affects their accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct accurate initial conditions for large-volume cosmological simulations without having to resort to expensive high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

    "The work function is one of the most important parameters in semiconductor devices, and its accurate measurement is essential for device design and performance prediction.  In this article we review some recent progresses on the determination of the work functions of various materials by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with synchrotron radiation as well as other techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We also discuss how to determine the absolute values of the work functions of different semiconductors based on UPS measurements. Finally, we present our perspectives on future research directions in this field. The work function is an important parameter in semiconductor devices, which determines their electrical properties including carrier transport behavior and Schottky barrier height [1] . Accurate measurement of the work function is therefore crucial for both fundamental understanding of electronic structure and practical applications [2] .\nIn this article, we will first briefly introduce several experimental methods used to measure the work function of various materials. Then we will show that these results can be compared directly if they are obtained under similar conditions. Afterwards, we will demonstrate how to determine the absolute value of the work function of different semiconductors through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPES) experiments.

It measures the kinetic energy distribution of electrons emitted from a sample when it is illuminated by monochromatic light at a specific photon energy hν [5] . By measuring the kinetic energy Ekin of photoelectrons emitted from the Fermi level EF into vacuum [6] , the work function Φ can then be determined according to the following equation: \nwhere e is the elementary charge and m* is the effective mass of the photoelectrons [7, 8] .

We consider two different supermanifolds as target spaces for this model: one is the supersphere and another is the supercoset space $SL(3,R)/SO(3)$. The latter has been studied by Witten [1] . In both cases we find that there are no tachyons or ghosts at tree level. However, when we calculate the beta functions to one-loop order, we find that they do not vanish even if we take into account all possible counterterms allowed by symmetries. This indicates that these models suffer from perturbative non-renormalizability. On the other hand, it turns out that the theories have exact global symmetry which can be used to construct an infinite number of conserved currents. These currents lead us to propose new Ward identities which relate correlation functions involving operators of different spin.",
    "We present an experimental investigation into complementarity and quantum nonlocality using a photonic implementation of the Einstein-Bohr photon box thought experiment. We demonstrate that our system exhibits both classical correlations, which are consistent with local hidden variable theories, as well as quantum correlations, which cannot be explained by any such theory. Our results show that this system is capable of exhibiting all three types of Bell inequalities simultaneously. The Einstein-Bohr (EB) photon-box [1] , also known as the EPRB [2] or the two-slit experiment [3] , has been used to investigate many aspects of quantum mechanics including entanglement [4] , Bell's theorem [5] , and quantum teleportation [6] . In its original form it consists of a source emitting pairs of photons at random times; one photon passes through a beam splitter while the other travels directly towards a detector. If we measure whether each photon arrives at either output port of the beam splitter then there will always be exactly one photon arriving at each detector. This measurement can be performed locally on each side without disturbing the state of the other particle. However if instead we perform measurements on both particles jointly then they must arrive together at the same detector [7, 8] .\nIn order for these experiments to exhibit genuine quantum effects, the detectors need to have high efficiency so that the probability of detecting more than one photon per pair is negligible [9] . Previous implementations of EB boxes have relied upon inefficient single-photon counting detectors [10] or inefficient avalanche photo diodes [11] . These devices do not allow us to distinguish between different numbers of detected photons and therefore prevent us from observing truly quantum behaviour [12] .",
    "We present an exact solution for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a two-level system coupled to fermionic reservoirs in terms of a Coulomb gas model defined on the Keldysch contour. The partition function is expressed as a functional integral over complex fields, which are related to the density matrix and current operators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We show that this formulation allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the time evolution of observables such as the occupation probabilities and currents through the junction between the leads and the central region. In particular we find that the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs via damped oscillations whose frequency depends on the bias voltage across the junction. This behavior can be understood within a simple rate equation approach. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to more complicated systems with multiple levels or spin degrees of freedom. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of transport properties of mesoscopic devices has attracted considerable attention during recent years due to their potential applications in quantum information processing [1] . A particularly interesting class of problems concerns the description of charge transfer processes taking place at low temperatures when the electronic states involved in the process are localized near Fermi surfaces [2] .\nIn order to describe these phenomena one usually considers models where electrons tunnel coherently between different regions (leads) connected by some scattering center [3] , e.g., a single level [4] or multi-level [5] impurity. These models have been studied extensively using various techniques ranging from perturbation theory [6] to numerical methods [7, 8] . However, it turns out that many important features cannot be captured by perturbative approaches [9] while standard numerical schemes suffer from severe limitations [10] . For example, they do not allow to treat large systems and/or strong interactions [11] . Therefore, new theoretical tools are needed to understand the physics behind these phenomena [12] .\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing analytical solutions for non-equilibrium transport problems based on mapping them onto effective statistical mechanics models [13] .

    "We study the effect of an external magnetic field on the modified Coulomb potential for two particles with opposite charges and masses, which are confined to move along one dimension. We show that this system can be mapped onto a spinless fermion model by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ground state energy is calculated exactly within the framework of Bethe ansatz method. It turns out that there exists a critical value of the magnetic field strength beyond which the ground state becomes degenerate. This result agrees well with previous numerical calculations based on exact diagonalization technique. \n \n In addition we calculate the density-density correlation function as well as the momentum distribution function numerically. These results agree very well with those obtained analytically through the use of Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to higher dimensions. Introduction:-In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the problem of strongly correlated electrons in low dimensional systems such as quantum wires or carbon nanotubes [1-3]. One of the most interesting phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantized Hall effect (FQHE) [4] . In particular it was shown that when the number of electrons N is odd ,the lowest Landau level(LLL) will contain only one electron per flux quanta [5] .The FQHEs have attracted much interest because they provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate many-body effects in condensed matter physics [6] .\nRecently, several authors [7-10] studied the properties of the modified coulomb interaction between two oppositely charged particles moving in a uniform magnetic field B perpendicularly to their plane of motion. They found that the ground-state energy depends crucially upon whether the total angular momentum J = L + S is zero or not where L is orbital angular momentum and S is spin angular momentum. For example if J=0 then the ground state energy is given by E0=−e2/lB+O(1/N),where lB=eB/mc is the magnetic length [11] .On the other hand if J=1/2 then the ground state energy takes the form E0",
    "We study the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and its stability properties for a class of ultimatum games with two-sided incomplete information, where one player is informed about his opponent's type while the other has no such information. We show that there exists a unique ESS which coincides with the Nash equilibrium if the set of types is finite or compactly supported on [0, 1] . If this set contains unbounded elements then we prove that the ESS may be unstable under small perturbations of the payoff functions. In particular, it can be shown that any ESS must satisfy certain conditions related to the distribution function of the types. Finally, we present some numerical examples illustrating our results. The evolutionary game theory studies how strategies evolve over time when players interact repeatedly within large populations. It provides a natural framework for analyzing strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are unable to commit themselves ex-ante but have the opportunity to learn by observing past play. A typical example of such situation arises in bargaining problems where each agent makes offers sequentially without knowing what proposals will be made by their opponents. This problem was first studied by Guth et al. (1982) , who introduced the so-called ultimatum game as a model of bargaining between two selfish individuals. In this game, Player 1 proposes a division of a fixed amount of money M into shares x and y = M −x offered to himself and Player 2 respectively; Player 2 either accepts or rejects the offer. If he accepts, both players receive their respective shares according to the proposal; otherwise they get nothing. Since the seminal work of Guth et al., many authors have investigated various aspects of the ultimatum game including existence and multiplicity of equilibria, efficiency loss due to lack of commitment power etc. (see e.g. Binmore & Shaked, 1993; Ochs & Roth, 1989) . However, all these works assume complete information among the players.",

    "We present a real-time renormalization-group approach for calculating the current through an interacting quantum dot coupled to leads at finite bias voltage, temperature, and gate voltage. We show that this method allows us to calculate the current as well as the time-dependent density matrix with high accuracy even when the system is far away from equilibrium. The results are compared to those obtained by numerically solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the Keldysh formalism. In particular we find excellent agreement between both methods if one chooses the cutoff scale appropriately. This shows that our method can be used to study strongly correlated systems out of equilibrium without any restriction on the strength of interactions or the coupling to external reservoirs. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of nanoscale devices such as single-molecule transistors [1] , carbon nanotubes [2] , semiconductor nanowires [3] , and quantum dots [4] have attracted considerable interest over recent years due to their potential applications in future electronic circuits [5] . However, it has been shown recently [6] that these devices often operate far away from thermal equilibrium which makes theoretical predictions based on standard approaches like the LandauerBüttiker formula [7, 8] questionable [9] .\nIn order to describe non-equilibrium phenomena correctly, various extensions of the conventional scattering theory [10] were developed [11] - [16] . These theories usually rely on the assumption that the relaxation times associated with different degrees of freedom (e.g., charge carriers) are much longer than typical time-scales characterizing the dynamics of the device [17] . As a consequence they cannot account for situations where strong correlations lead to fast equilibration processes [18] . Moreover, most of them do not allow to treat non-Markovian effects arising e.g.",
    "We present results on testing different outer boundary conditions in numerical relativity, using two black hole spacetimes as testbeds.  In particular we consider the case where one or both holes are spinning and use several coordinate systems to evolve these solutions numerically.   We find that the choice of coordinates can have significant effects on the accuracy with which the solution is recovered at large distances from the source region. The most accurate results were obtained by evolving the initial data sets in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates (KSC). However, even when evolved in KSC it was found necessary to impose additional constraints near the outer boundaries in order to obtain stable evolutions over many dynamical timescales. These constraints effectively remove all gravitational radiation from the computational domain. Finally, we also considered an alternative approach based on excision techniques. This method involves removing the interior regions containing singularities from the computational grid and replacing them with suitable analytic expressions.",
    "We present new exact solutions to the Einstein field equations for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes with two commuting Killing vectors, which are generated by applying nonholonomic frame transforms (NFT) to known vacuum solutions. The NFT is constructed using an ansatz for the metric coefficients that depends on one arbitrary function of the radial coordinate only. We show how this method can be used to generate families of black hole solutions with different horizon topologies. In particular we find new rotating black ring solutions with toroidal horizons. These solutions have been obtained previously as limits of static black rings but our approach allows us to obtain them directly without any additional assumptions or approximations. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to these results. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.Cq \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms [1] . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see [2] - [4] for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one [5] .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves [6] . Stationary axisymmetric spacetimes play an important role in astrophysics since they describe the exterior gravitational field of spinning objects like stars, planets, and black holes [7, 8]",
    "The concept of dynamical 3-space is introduced in this review article as an alternative to the standard space-time picture of relativistic physics. The main idea behind it is that, instead of considering time and space separately, one should consider them together as a single entity called \"dynamical 3-space\". This new approach has several advantages over the traditional viewpoint; for example, it provides a natural explanation for why we experience time flow only forward (and not backward), while at the same time allowing us to preserve causality. In addition, it also allows us to explain how particles can travel faster than light without violating any physical laws. Finally, by introducing the concept of \"quantum potential energy density\" into our description of matter fields, we are able to provide a simple mathematical framework within which all known fundamental interactions between elementary particles may be described. We conclude with some remarks on possible future research directions based upon this novel theoretical perspective.",
    "We present the results of laboratory measurements on composite interstellar grains, which are composed of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials with various compositions. The samples were irradiated by energetic protons in order to simulate cosmic ray bombardment under conditions similar to those found in dense clouds where dust is formed. We have measured infrared (IR) emission spectra before and after proton irradiation at energies ranging from 1 MeV/nucleon up to 100 MeV/nucleon for different sample temperatures between 10 K and 300 K. In addition we performed IR transmission spectroscopy experiments using synchrotron radiation as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Our experimental data show that the composition of the grain material has an important influence on its response towards proton irradiation. For example, the intensity ratio of the 3.4 micron feature over the 11 micron feature increases significantly when the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons relative to silicates decreases.",
    "We present the first fully self-consistent, atomistic quantum transport calculations for ballistic graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with realistic band structure and electrostatic potential profiles using nonequilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (DFT). We show that the GNRs' electronic properties are strongly dependent on their widths as well as edge structures. The calculated current-voltage characteristics reveal several interesting features such as negative differential resistance at low bias voltages due to resonant tunneling through localized states near the Fermi level. In addition, we find that the presence of hydrogen passivation layers can significantly enhance the device performance by suppressing the backscattering effect caused by defects or impurities along the edges. \n \n Keywords: Ballistic transport, Graphene nanoribbon, Nonequilibrium Green's functions, Density functional theory, Quantum transport calculation. 1 Introduction \n \n Graphene is an emerging material which has attracted considerable attention recently because it exhibits unique physical properties [1] . It consists of carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice where each carbon atom forms covalent bonds with three neighboring carbons [2] . Due to its two-dimensional nature, graphene shows high carrier mobility [3] , thermal conductivity [4] , mechanical strength [5] , optical transparency [6] , and flexibility [7] . These remarkable properties make graphene promising candidates for future nanoelectronic devices [8] .\n \nGraphene nanoribbons (G-NR), i.e., strips of graphene with finite width [9] , have been proposed as building blocks for various applications including transistors [10] , interconnects [11] , photodetectors [12] , solar cells [13] , sensors [14] , etc.. Compared to conventional silicon-based electronics [15] , GNRs offer many advantages [16] : they exhibit higher electron mobilities [17] ; they allow better control over the charge carriers [18] ; they provide more design freedom [19] ; and they enable new functionality [20] . However, there still exist some challenges associated with practical realization of GNRs [21] . For example, the fabrication process requires precise control of ribbon width [22] and edge roughness [23] . Moreover, the electrical properties of GNRs depend sensitively",
    "We study the evolution of age structure and life history traits by using an age-structured population model with stochastic demographic events, where individuals can reproduce at any age. We show that selection against demographic stochasticity leads to increased reproductive effort early in life (i.e., earlier reproduction) and decreased mortality rates later in life. This is because higher reproductive efforts increase offspring numbers but also lead to more deaths due to competition for resources among siblings. In contrast, lower mortality rates decrease sibling competition and thus reduce the number of deaths caused by this source of demographic stochasticity. Our results are robust across different levels of environmental stochasticity and initial conditions. The evolutionary consequences of demographic stochasticity have been studied extensively in recent years [1–3] . However, most studies on this topic focus on populations without age structure or assume that all individuals reproduce at the same age [4–6] , which may not be realistic [7–9] .\nHere we use an age-structured model with stochastic demographic events [10, 11] to investigate how selection acts on life-history traits when there is variation in individual ages at first reproduction [12] . Specifically, we consider a scenario where individuals can reproduce at various ages and compete for limited resources within their family groups [13] . We find that selection against demographic stochasticities increases reproductive effort early in life and decreases mortality rates late in life. These findings are consistent with previous theoretical work showing that selection favors reduced variance in offspring number [14–18] .",
    "We study evolutionary dynamics in an ensemble of genotypes, each with its own fitness value and connected to other genotypes by mutations. We show that for large ensembles there is always one genotype which has more connections than any other genotype. This genotype dominates all others at equilibrium. The dominance of this genotype depends only on the distribution of mutational distances between pairs of genotypes. For example, if we consider two different distributions of mutational distances (the exponential and power law), then the same genotype will dominate both cases. However, the time it takes to reach equilibrium can be very different depending on how many paths lead away from the dominant genotype. In particular, when the number of paths leading away from the dominant genotype increases exponentially as a function of distance, the system reaches equilibrium much faster compared to the case where the number of paths grows slower or even remains constant. \n \n We also find that the average population size of the dominant genotype decreases slowly over time until reaching equilibrium.",
    "We present an open-source code, called XSCORT (X-ray Spectral Code for Reprocessed Torus), which computes the reprocessing of radiation by optically-thick matter in the form of a torus and its associated wind. The code is written as a set of IDL routines that can be easily modified to study different geometries or physical conditions. We describe how we implemented our model using Monte Carlo techniques and discuss some tests performed with simulated data. Finally, we show examples of applications of this new tool to two well-studied objects, NGC 4151 and Mrk 509. \nThe main goal of XSCORT is to provide a flexible framework where one can explore the effects of various parameters such as: geometry, density distribution, chemical composition, ionization state, etc., on the observed spectral properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This will allow us to better understand their nature and evolution. \n \n In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of the presence of an outflowing component on the shape of the reflection hump produced by the innermost regions of the accretion disc around supermassive black holes. These winds may play an important role in shaping the broad-band continuum emission of these sources through absorption and/or scattering processes. They also affect the amount of material available to produce the reflected emission at larger distances from the central source.",
    "We report the observation of electron-hole puddles in graphene using scanning single-electron transistors (SETs). The SET is fabricated on top of an exfoliated monolayer graphene flake and operated at cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K. We observe that the conductance through the SET depends strongly on its position with respect to the underlying graphene sheet, which we attribute to local variations in charge carrier density induced by charged impurities trapped between the substrate and the graphene layer. This effect can be suppressed by applying a gate voltage Vg = -40 V across the graphene sample. Our results demonstrate that the use of SETs as probes for studying electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as graphene has great potential. In recent years there have been significant advances in the fabrication of devices based on carbon nanotubes [1] , silicon nanowires [2] or semiconductor quantum dots [3] . These nanostructures are used as active elements in various types of sensors [4] , optoelectronic [5] and photovoltaic [6] applications. However, these structures suffer from several drawbacks including poor reproducibility due to their small size and low yield during growth processes [7, 8] .\nIn contrast, graphene [9] offers many advantages over other two dimensional materials [10] : it is mechanically flexible [11] , chemically stable [12] , biocompatible [13] and electrically conductive [14] . Moreover, it can be produced in large quantities via chemical vapor deposition [15] or mechanical exfoliation [16] techniques [17] . Recently, graphene-based field-effect transistors [18] were demonstrated [19, 20] opening up new avenues towards high-performance electronics [21] . Despite all these attractive features, however, one major challenge remains in achieving high-quality electrical contacts to graphene [22] .",
    "We study the scattering amplitudes for gluons and gravitons at strong coupling using classical string solutions in Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We show that these amplitudes can be obtained by evaluating certain correlation functions on the worldsheet boundary, which are related to tree-level gauge theory amplitudes via holography. The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states. These arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincare transformations; they correspond to corrections to the supergravity action induced by higher derivative terms in the bulk effective field theory. \nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence [1] relates type IIB superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) to conformal field theories living on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been used extensively over recent years as a tool to explore non-perturbative phenomena in quantum gravity [2] . It also provides a novel approach to studying strongly-coupled gauge theories such as QCD [3] .\nIn this talk we will consider the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence -the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N=4 SYM) theory [4] , whose dual description involves type IIA strings moving in AdS 5 × S 5 [5] . At weak 't Hooft coupling λ = g 2 Y M N ≪ 1, where g Y M denotes the Yang-Mills coupling constant, perturbative calculations have shown that the two descriptions match exactly [6] . However, it remains unclear how to calculate quantities like scattering amplitudes directly within the gauge theory at large values of λ [7, 8] . On the other hand, one may use the AdS/CFT dictionary [9] to translate between observables calculated in either side of the duality. For instance, the expectation value of Wilson loops in the gauge theory corresponds to the area of minimal surfaces embedded into AdS [10] ; while n-point correlators of local operators in the gauge theory are given by functional integrals over n-punctured Riemann surfaces [11] .",
    "The increasing amount and complexity of oceanographic data requires new approaches to the analysis, visualization and interpretation of these datasets. In this work we present an interactive visual analytics system that allows users to explore large volumes of 3D oceanographic data in order to detect patterns and anomalies. The main goal is to provide scientists with powerful tools to analyze their data without having to be experts on computer graphics or visualization techniques. We use state-of-the-art volume rendering algorithms combined with advanced interaction techniques such as brushing, linking and querying. Our approach has been tested by using real-world oceanographic data sets collected during several research cruises around Europe. This article presents our results and discusses future directions. Oceanographers are increasingly collecting massive amounts of data about the oceans' physical properties (e.g., temperature, salinity) and biological processes (e.g., plankton blooms). These data can be used to study phenomena like global warming, pollution spreading, marine life migration etc.. However, analyzing and interpreting these huge volumes of data remains challenging due to its high dimensionality and complex relationships between variables. Interactive visual analytics systems have shown great potential in helping scientists discover hidden patterns and anomalies within their data [1] . They allow researchers to interactively explore their data through different views while simultaneously performing queries and applying filters [2] .\nIn this work we present Diagnostic Tools for Unstructured Data (DUT), a novel visual analytics tool designed specifically for exploring large volumes of 3D oceanic data. DUT provides scientists with powerful tools to perform exploratory analyses of their data without requiring them to be experts on computer science or visualization techniques [3] , thus allowing them to focus more on the actual content of their data rather than how it should be presented [4] .",
    "We present new observations in the mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR), as well as archival data, to study the physical conditions of the gas surrounding the young stellar object Re 4 IRS located at the center of the reflection nebula NGC 1333 IRAS 2. We find that the MIR spectrum is dominated by strong ro-vibrational lines of H$_2$O and CO, while the NIR spectrum shows prominent Brackett-γ line emission with an equivalent width of ~1 Å. The observed fluxes are consistent with those expected for a T Tauri star surrounded by a dense circumstellar disk heated by accretion shocks. In addition, we detect several forbidden transitions of [Fe II] , [S III] , [N II] , and [C II] . These results suggest that the central source has recently undergone a burst of enhanced mass loss activity which may be related to its recent transition into the main sequence phase.",
    "We present an efficient numerical scheme to detect the existence of periodic orbits in chaotically behaving dynamical systems, such as chaotic maps or chaotic flows. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of shadowing trajectories which are close approximations of unstable periodic orbits embedded within the attractor. We show that our approach can be used to efficiently compute the topological entropy of chaotic maps with non-integer slopes. Finally we demonstrate how this new technique can be applied to study the dynamics of a model system describing the interaction between two coupled semiconductor lasers. Periodic orbits play an important role in understanding the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular they provide valuable information about the underlying structure of the attractors associated with these systems. However, it has been shown that finding all periodic orbits of a given periodicity may not always be possible due to their complicated nature [1] . This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with chaotic systems where the number of periodic orbits increases exponentially with increasing period [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop techniques to find periodic orbits numerically [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , but most of them suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: (i) They require very high computational resources. (ii) They do not guarantee convergence towards the desired orbit. Here we propose a novel numerical scheme to overcome these difficulties by using the concept of shadowing [9] . Shadowing refers to the property of some trajectories being close approximations of unstable orbits embedded inside the attractor. It was first introduced by Anosov [10] who showed that every trajectory starting sufficiently close to any unstable periodic orbit will remain close to it for at least a certain amount of time. Since then various authors [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44",
    "We study the propagation of traveling waves (TWs) in excitable media with spatially distributed parameters, which are subject to both external forcing and internal fluctuations. We show that TWs can be generated spontaneously even if there is no deterministic source for them. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is related to the presence of an unstable stationary state between two stable ones. In particular, we demonstrate how spontaneous generation of TWs occurs due to stochastic resonance induced by additive white Gaussian noise. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating the effect of multiplicative colored noise on the dynamics of TWs. Propagation of traveling waves (TW) in excitable media has been studied extensively over recent years [1] . It was shown that TWs may appear as a result of various mechanisms such as: i) intrinsic instabilities [2] , ii) coupling-induced instabilities [3] or iii) forced oscillations [4] .\nIn many cases it is assumed that the medium under consideration is homogeneous so that all its properties do not depend explicitly on space coordinates. However, real physical systems usually have spatial variations of their characteristics [5] . For example, one-dimensional models describing cardiac tissue [6] include heterogeneity in the form of local changes in refractory periods [7, 8] . Another important factor influencing wave propagation is noise [9] . Noise plays different roles depending on whether it acts additively [10] or multiplicatively [11] . Moreover, noise may also affect the shape of the propagating front [12] .",
    "In this article, we present an approach for studying special Finsler manifolds by using global methods and techniques in Riemannian geometry. We introduce some new concepts such as geodesic convexity, strongly convexity, and strictly convexity on special Finsler manifolds. Then, we prove that every special Finsler manifold is locally geodesically convex at any point. Finally, we show that if a special Finsler manifold admits a strictly convex function then it has constant flag curvature. Keywords: Geodesic convexity, Finsler metric, Flag curvature. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 53C20, 53C25, 53A10. In this article, we study special Finsler manifolds with global methods and techniques in the theory of Riemannian geometry. First, we define geodesic convexity and strongly convexity on special Finslser manifolds. Then, under certain conditions, we prove that every Finsler manifold is locally  geodesically convex at each point.

    "We show that any physical realization of the quantum NOT gate must be accompanied by an energy cost, which is bounded below by a universal constant times the number of qubits in the system. This result follows directly from our proof of the existence of a lower bound on the ground-state energy density of certain spin systems with competing interactions and open boundary conditions. Our results are relevant to recent efforts aimed at realizing large-scale quantum computers using solid state devices such as semiconductor quantum dots or trapped ions. We also discuss possible extensions of this work to other types of quantum gates. The ability to perform arbitrary unitary transformations on a set of n qubits would constitute a quantum computer capable of solving problems exponentially faster than classical computers [1] . However, it has been shown [2] that no quantum algorithm can solve all computational problems more efficiently than its best known classical counterpart unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Thus, practical quantum computing requires efficient methods for implementing only those algorithms whose solutions cannot be found classically [3] .\nIn order to implement these algorithms, one needs to be able to perform basic operations such as single-qubit rotations [4] , two-qubit entangling gates [5] , and measurements [6] . In particular, the so-called CNOT (controlled-NOT) gate plays a central role [7, 8] since it allows one to construct many important quantum circuits [9] . Unfortunately, there exists no known method for constructing a general CNOT gate [10] ; however, several proposals have recently emerged [11] - [16] . These schemes typically involve coupling the spins of individual atoms via magnetic fields [17] and/or optical cavities [18] . While some experimental progress towards building small-scale quantum computers has already been made [19, 20] , scaling up these technologies remains extremely challenging [21] .",
    "We report on the observation of electron doping in cuprate superconductors by interfacing them to manganite insulators through epitaxial growth and chemical bonding at interfaces.  The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers [1] . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity [2] . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory [3] , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc [4] .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value [5] . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane [6] . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system [7, 8] . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3 [9] or LaAlO3 [10] onto the surface of cuprate superconductors. While these approaches show promise, they require precise control over film composition and structure during deposition [11] . An alternative strategy would involve controlling the carrier density in cuprates without changing their crystal structures [12] .",
    "We study number density correlation functions (NDCFs) in classical one-component plasma at high temperatures and find that they are not well defined due to infrared divergences, which is related with the fact that NDCF can be expressed as an integral over the whole space. We show how these difficulties can be overcome by introducing a new quantity called local number density correlation function (LNDCF). The LNDCF has no infrared divergence but it still contains information about correlations between particles on different length scales. In particular we calculate LNDCF for two limiting cases - when all particles have equal velocities or when their distribution is Maxwellian. Finally we discuss possible applications of our results.

    "We present new observational constraints on the cosmic ray (CR) energy density and its evolution with redshift, based on gamma-ray observations by Fermi/LAT in the range 0 < z < 1.5. We find that CRs contribute at most 10% to the total pressure budget of the universe at redshifts below 2. This upper limit is consistent with theoretical expectations for the contribution of CRs accelerated by supernovae. The results are also compatible with previous measurements using radio data. These limits can be used as priors when modeling the effects of CRs on cosmological observables such as galaxy clustering or weak lensing. Cosmic rays (CRs), charged particles which fill space uniformly over large volumes, have been observed throughout our Galaxy and beyond. They play an important role in many astrophysical phenomena including galactic winds, star formation, and possibly even the acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays [1] . However, their origin remains unknown [2] .\nIn this work we use gamma-ray observations made by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi satellite [3] , to place tight constraints on the amount of CRs contributing to the overall pressure budget of the Universe [4] . In particular, we consider two different models for the CR distribution function f(p,z). First, we assume that it follows a power law spectrum dN/dE ~ E^{-alpha} between energies Emin = 10 GeV and Emax = 100 TeV; secondly, we adopt a broken power-law model where the spectral index changes from alpha1 = -2.2 to alpha2 = -3 above some break energy Eb = 50 GeV. For both cases, we fix the normalization factor A by requiring that the integral of f(p,z) over all momenta equals unity. \nThe resulting CR distributions are shown in Figure 1 . \nTo calculate the effect of these CR populations on the expansion history of the universe, we solve numerically the coupled system of equations describing the time-evolution of the background...",
    "We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations and modeling results for the young stellar object, Barnard 68 (B68). The NIR data were obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii during two nights in December 2005. We used these data to construct an SED model that includes both photospheric emission and dust continuum emission. Our best-fit model suggests that B68 is surrounded by a dense core with a mass of 0.1 M_solar_(M_solar = 1.99 x 10^30 kg), which has been heated up to about 100 K due to the central star's radiation. This temperature corresponds to a luminosity of 3 L_sun_(L_sun = 3.84 x 10^26 W). In addition, we found that there are at least three other sources within the field-of-view of our observation whose fluxes contribute significantly to the total observed flux density.",
    "The Double Chooz experiment is designed to measure the mixing angle θ13 by searching for the appearance of electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam produced at the CERN SPS accelerator complex and directed towards France. The near detector (ND) measures the flux, energy spectrum and composition of this beam with high precision. In addition it provides an accurate measurement of the backgrounds expected in the far detector (FD). This document describes how we exploit these measurements to improve our knowledge on the systematic uncertainties affecting the FD analysis. \nIntroduction\n\nDouble Chooz [1] aims at measuring the third mixing angle θ 13 . It uses a reactor-based neutrino source located at about 1 km distance from its near detector ND280 [2] , which consists of several sub-detectors surrounding the target volume where neutrinos are created. The main goal of the experiment is to search for the appearance of electron-neutrinos in a muon-neutrino beam produced at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), as illustrated in Figure 1 .\nIn order to achieve the required statistical accuracy within reasonable running time, the experiment will run in two phases. Phase I started in 2011 and ran until 2014; during that phase only one out of four possible detectors was operational. Phase II has just begun and runs until 2019 or 2020 when all detectors should be fully operational. During both phases data taking takes place simultaneously with the far detector (FD) situated 12 m underground at a distance of 1 km from the ND280 target [3] . \nNeutrino Flux Prediction\nThe prediction of the neutrino flux Φ(Eν ) reaching the ND280 detector depends on many parameters such as: the number N p of protons hitting the production target per second, their kinetic energy T p , the fraction f π 0 of neutral pions decaying into photons, the pion momentum distribution dN/dpπ etc.. These quantities can be measured directly using dedicated calibration experiments [4] . For example, the proton current Ip = Np /T p is determined by counting the number of protons hitting the target over a given period of time",
    "We present new results on the evolution of galaxy clustering in the range 0 < z < 5, based on an analysis of data obtained with the VIMOS spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The sample consists of about 2000 galaxies selected by their Lyman-alpha emission line fluxes and covers a wide range of redshifts between 2<z<5. We measure the two-point correlation function for this sample using both direct counts-in-cells methods as well as Fourier space techniques. Our main result is that we find no evidence for any significant change in the amplitude or slope of the correlation function over this large redshift interval. This suggests that there has been little evolution in the typical mass scale of dark matter halos hosting these galaxies since z=5. In addition to measuring the overall shape of the correlation function, we also examine how it depends upon various physical properties such as luminosity, color, and spectral type.",
    "We study the cosmological evolution of modified-gravity theories with an action that contains higher-order curvature terms (f(R)) by using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations. We show how to obtain exact solutions for the background expansion history of these models at early times when the universe is dominated by radiation or matter; we also derive approximate analytic expressions valid on all scales during the late-time accelerated phase driven by dark energy. In particular, we find that there are two classes of viable f(R) models which can reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration without introducing any new degrees of freedom beyond those present in general relativity. The first class includes models where the effective gravitational constant decreases as time goes on; this leads to a phantom-like behavior characterized by w < −1. The second class consists of models where the effective gravitational coupling increases with time; here one finds quintessence-like behaviors with w > −1. Finally, we discuss some observational tests that could be used to distinguish between different types of f(R) models.",
    "In this work, we consider the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) for code division multiple access systems with time-varying channels. We propose an algorithm that jointly performs user identification and data detection by using a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which iteratively estimates both the channel coefficients and transmitted symbols. In order to reduce computational complexity, we also develop a low-complexity suboptimal MUD scheme. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing schemes under various scenarios. Index Terms-Data detection, EM algorithm, Multiuser detection, Time varying channels. 1 Introduction Code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) has been widely used as one of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless communications due to its high spectral efficiency [1] . However, CDMA suffers from severe interference between users caused by multipath propagation [2] , especially when the number of active users increases [3] .\nTo mitigate inter-user interference, multiuser detectors have been developed [4] - [6] . Among them, linear multiuser detectors are attractive because they can be implemented easily at low cost [7] . Unfortunately, these detectors suffer from performance loss compared to optimal multiuser detectors [8] . To improve their performance, nonlinear multiuser detectors such as successive interference cancellation [9] or parallel interference cancellation [10] were introduced. These detectors require accurate knowledge about the received signals [11] . Therefore, blind multiuser detectors [12] - [14] were proposed to estimate unknown parameters without any training sequence [15] . Although blind multiuser detectors do not need prior information about the received signal, they usually perform worse than conventional multiuser detectors [16] .\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing multiuser detectors for time-varying channels [17] - [20] . Since the channel varies over time, it becomes more difficult to detect the transmitted symbol accurately [21] . Moreover, if the channel changes rapidly, then the detector may fail completely [22] . Thus, it is important to design robust multiuser detectors against rapid channel variations [23] .",
    "We present exact solutions to the field equations of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonet (EGB) gravity with negative cosmological constant in 5D space-time. We find that there are three classes of black hole solutions depending on whether the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is positive or negative. The first class contains two types of static spherically symmetric black holes which have no horizons but possess naked singularities at their centers. In addition we also obtain another type of solution describing an asymptotically anti-de Sitter wormhole whose throat connects two asymptotic regions. Finally, by using the method developed recently by one of us, we construct a new type of solution representing a time-dependent spacetime horn.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe discovery of gravitational waves has opened up a new window into our understanding of gravitation [1] , especially when it comes to testing general relativity [2] . However, despite its successes, general relativity still fails to explain some phenomena such as dark energy [3] and quantum gravity [4] . Therefore, many alternative theories of gravity were proposed over the years [5] .\nOne of these alternatives is the so-called Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity [6] - [8] . It can be viewed as a natural generalization of general relativity since it includes higher-order curvature corrections [9] . Moreover, this theory admits various interesting solutions including black holes [10]- [12] , wormholes [13] - [15] and even time dependent spacetimes [16] - [18] . Recently, EGB gravity attracted much attention due to its possible role in explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe [19] - [21] .",
    "We study the dynamic properties of molecular motors by using burnt-bridge models, which are simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin V. We show that these models reproduce several experimental results on single-molecule experiments with high accuracy.  In particular, we find that the velocity distribution is well described by an exponential function at low load force but deviates from it when the load increases. The mean square displacement shows subdiffusive behavior under large loads. These behaviors can be explained by considering the effect of the elasticity of the cargoes carried by the motors. Our model also reproduces the dependence of stall forces on external viscous drag coefficients observed experimentally. Finally, our simulation results suggest that the number of steps taken per ATP hydrolysis cycle decreases exponentially with increasing load force. This result may explain why the step size fluctuation becomes larger than expected theoretically near stalling conditions. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nMolecular motors play important roles in many biological processes including muscle contraction [1] , vesicle transport [2] , chromosome segregation [3] , and cell division [4] . They convert chemical energy into mechanical work through repeated cycles of binding to cytoskeletal filaments (e.g., microtubules) and releasing them [5] .\nThe most extensively studied class of molecular motors is the kinesins [6] . Kinesins walk along microtubules toward their plus ends [7, 8] . Myosins move towards actin filaments' minus ends [9] . Both types of motors have been shown to take discrete steps [10 -12] . Recent studies have revealed that both kinesins [13] and myosins [14] exhibit stochastic stepping motions even without external loads [15 -19] . It has been suggested that this randomness arises mainly due to thermal fluctuations [20, 21] or internal noise [22] . However, there still remain open questions about how they respond to external loads [23] .\nIn order to understand the mechanism underlying the operation of molecular motors, various theoretical approaches have been developed so far [24] . Among those methods, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations [25] provide useful information on",
    "We study the ground state properties and excitations in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions only, using exact diagonalization (ED) for small clusters up to 12 sites as well as density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations for larger systems. We find that the ground-state energy per site is lower than the classical value by about 0.25J, where J denotes the exchange coupling constant between neighboring spins. The magnetic susceptibility shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures but decreases rapidly below T = 2J/3. This indicates strong quantum fluctuations which are also reflected in the low-temperature dependence of the specific heat. In addition we observe an unusual peak structure in the spin-spin correlation function S(q). For q along the principal axes of the Brillouin zone this peak has its maximum at q = π while it shifts towards smaller values when approaching the diagonals.",
    "The study of critical phenomena is one of the most important topics in statistical physics, and has been applied to many fields such as biology, sociology, computer science, etc.. In this talk I will introduce some recent results on critical phenomena in complex networks. The main idea behind these works is that we can use the concept of \"network resilience\" to characterize different phases of a system with respect to its robustness against external perturbations or internal failures. We show how to detect phase transitions by measuring the size fluctuations of the largest connected component (LCC) of an evolving network under random attacks. Furthermore, we propose a new method for detecting phase transitions based on the evolution of the LCC's diameter. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work to other types of networks beyond scale-free ones. This research was supported by NSFC grant No.11271063.

    "We study the dynamics of an interacting tachyonic field in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with zero spatial curvature, using numerical methods to solve the equations of motion.  We find that there are two distinct phases during which the energy density evolves differently; one phase is dominated by the kinetic energy of the fields while the other is dominated by their potential energies.  The transition between these phases occurs when the Hubble parameter becomes comparable to the mass scale associated with the interaction term.  During this transition period we observe oscillatory behavior in both the Hubble parameter and the energy densities of each individual field.  In addition, we find that the total energy density decreases more slowly than it would if only one component were present (i.e., either a single tachyonic or a single scalar field).  Finally, we show how our results can be used to construct viable inflationary models. We consider a model consisting of a tachyonic field coupled to another scalar field through a quartic self-interaction term.  Using numerical techniques, we examine the time-evolution of various quantities such as the Hubble parameter, the energy densities of each field individually, and the total energy density.  Our analysis reveals several interesting features including the presence of a transition region where the Hubble parameter becomes comparable...",
    "We report on neutron scattering experiments performed to study magnetic excitations in an underdoped cuprate superconductor, YBa2Cu3Ox (x = 6.35). We observe that the intensity and linewidth of the low-energy spin waves decrease with increasing temperature up to T* ~ 150 K, which is higher than Tc by about 50 K. The observed behavior can be explained within the framework of the spin-fermion model if one assumes that the spin-wave lifetime decreases rapidly at temperatures close to T* due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles. This interpretation implies that the pseudogap opens already below T* as suggested previously. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high-temperature superconductors using neutron scattering techniques [1-5]. Neutron scattering allows us not only to investigate the static structure factor S(Q) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons [6]. It was found recently [7-9] that the low energy spin wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 displays unusual features compared to conventional metals. For example, it exhibits a strong dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions [8] and shows significant deviations from the usual linear dependence between the inverse spin wave velocity and momentum [9]. These results have stimulated theoretical studies [10-12] aimed at understanding how these unconventional spin wave properties are related to the electronic structure of the CuO2 planes. However, little attention has so far been paid to the effect of doping on the spin wave dynamics. Here we present new experimental data obtained on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX (x= 6.35), where x denotes the oxygen content [13]. Our main goal is to explore whether the spin wave properties change significantly when going away from optimal doping towards lower values of x.",
    "We present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) . It has been suggested that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during different stages of evolution of molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). \n \n Recent observational studies have shown that many young massive stars are associated with filamentary structures observed in infrared dust emission maps (André et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2013 ). These filaments often appear to be aligned along magnetic field directions inferred from polarisation measurements (Chapman et al. 2011) , suggesting that magnetic fields might play an important role in regulating the dynamics of such systems. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields can affect the stability properties of self-gravitating clouds against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomis",
    "We present an alternative description of the electron in terms of its position and velocity, which is based on the idea that it moves along a helical trajectory around the nucleus. The new approach leads to a simple analytical expression for the energy levels of the helium atom as well as for the wave functions corresponding to these states. We show how this model can be used to explain some experimental results obtained by high-resolution spectroscopy experiments performed at Jefferson Lab. In addition we discuss possible extensions of our work towards other atomic systems such as muonic atoms or ions with one valence electron. Helium has been studied extensively over many decades both experimentally and theoretically. It was found that there are two stable isotopes (3He and 4He) and several excited states. These states have been investigated using various spectroscopic techniques including photo-absorption [1] , laser excitation [2] , and Compton scattering [3] . However, despite all efforts made so far, no satisfactory explanation exists yet about why the ground state of 3He is unbound while the ground state of 4He is bound [4] .\nIn order to understand better the structure of helium, we propose here a new theoretical framework where the electron is described not only by its usual position but also by its velocity vector. This new approach allows us to obtain analytically the energy spectrum of helium as well as the associated wavefunctions. Our formalism is inspired by the so-called Bohmian mechanics [5] , which describes particles moving along trajectories instead of following classical equations of motions [6] .",
    "We present an algorithm for decomposing functions defined over quadratic surfaces in three dimensions, such as the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid, into multipole expansions. The method is based on representing the function using spherical harmonics and then expanding each term in this representation into a sum of products of Legendre polynomials with coefficients that are determined by solving a linear system of equations. We demonstrate our approach through several examples including computing the electrostatic potential due to point charges located at various positions around a dielectric sphere immersed in water. Our results show that we can accurately compute the electrostatic potential even when there are many sources distributed throughout space. This work was supported by NSF grant DMS-0852653 (CAREER). Spherical harmonic decomposition has been used extensively in computational physics applications ranging from quantum chemistry [1] , molecular dynamics [2] , and plasma simulations [3] . In these applications, one often needs to represent a given function f(r) defined over some domain Ω in terms of its expansion coefficients C lm :",
    "The vapor pressure, solubility in water, and interfacial tension between oil and water are important parameters for understanding the behavior of crude oils during their production or transport through pipelines.  In this study we have investigated these properties using alkanol monolayers on an aqueous subphase as model systems to mimic the hydrocarbon chains present in crude oils. The results show that the vapor pressures of the alkanols increase with chain length up to C8 but decrease again above C10. This is explained by considering the competition between two opposing effects:  On one hand, increasing chain lengths lead to higher molecular volumes which favor evaporation. On the other hand, longer chains also result in stronger van der Waals interactions within the liquid phase leading to lower vapor pressures. We find that the solubilities of the alkanols follow similar trends as those observed for the vapor pressures. However, the differences in solubility among different chain lengths become smaller when compared to the corresponding differences in vapor pressure. Finally, our measurements reveal that the interfacial tensions between the alkanol layers and the underlying water decreases monotonically with chain length.",

    "We study the geometry and topology of generalized Lagrangian submanifolds (GLSMs) in complex symplectic manifolds, focusing on GLSMs that are special Lagrangians with respect to some Kähler form. We show how these can be constructed as holomorphic sections of certain line bundles over moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles. In particular we consider the case where the base is a partial flag variety. This leads us to define new families of Calabi-Yau varieties which have been studied by physicists recently. These varieties are obtained by taking products of Grassmannian manifolds or their quotients by finite groups. The main results of this thesis are:  1. A construction of GLSMs using parabolic Higgs bundles.  2. An explicit description of the cohomology ring of the total space of a vector bundle associated to a parabolic Higgs bundle.  3. A proof of mirror symmetry between two different types of GLSMs defined above when the base is a product of Grassmannians.",
    "We present the results of an optimization study for future galaxy surveys, aimed at constraining cosmological parameters in the context of general relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravitation. We consider two different classes of experiments: weak lensing tomography with Euclid-like specifications, and 21cm intensity mapping observations with SKA1-LOW-like specifications. In both cases we assume that systematics can be controlled down to percent level accuracy. For each experiment we compute the Fisher matrix associated with the measurement of several relevant observables as functions of the underlying cosmology. The resulting covariance matrices are then used to perform parameter forecasts using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our main findings are:  - Weak lensing tomography is able to provide competitive constraints on w0 and wa when combined with Planck data.  - Intensity mapping experiments will not significantly improve our knowledge about the equation-of-state of dark energy beyond what has already been achieved by current CMB measurements.",
    "We study the dynamics of an asymmetric exclusion process with two species on a ring, where particles can hop to their right or left neighboring site and are subject to hard-core repulsion. We show that for any initial condition there exists a unique stationary state which is characterized by a density profile depending only on the distance between sites. In particular we find that this profile decays exponentially fast as one moves away from the origin. This result implies that the system exhibits dynamic screening, i.e., correlations decay exponentially fast at large distances even though the underlying microscopic model does not have translational invariance. The proof relies on a combination of techniques from probability theory (in particular martingale methods) and functional analysis. Our results hold both for finite systems and infinite lattices. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years much attention has been devoted to studying nonequilibrium steady states of driven lattice gases [1] . These models describe interacting particle systems evolving according to stochastic rules such that detailed balance cannot be satisfied globally [2] , but nevertheless they exhibit interesting macroscopic behavior [3] .\nOne class of these models consists of so-called exclusion processes [4] describing particles moving along a regular lattice under mutual exclusion constraints [5] . For example, consider a chain of L sites labeled by integers 1, ..., L, each occupied by either zero or one particle. Particles may jump to the right or left neighboring site provided it is empty [6] . If all jumps occur independently then the resulting Markov process satisfies detailed balance with respect to some product measure [7, 8] . However if the rates depend on the number of particles occupying adjacent sites [9] then detailed balance breaks down [10] . Despite this lack of equilibrium properties many of these models still display non-trivial features reminiscent of those observed in thermal equilibrium [11] .",
    "We consider the wiretap channel model in which an eavesdropper can obtain feedback about its observations and use it to improve future decoding attempts. We show that, for any positive integer , there exists a sequence of (2, ) codes such that each code has rate at least . This result is obtained by combining polar coding techniques with ideas from successive cancellation list decoding. The proof relies on a new converse bound for the secrecy capacity region of the wiretap channel with feedback. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating our achievability scheme. In this work, we study the wiretap channel model introduced by Wyner [1] . In particular, we focus on the case where the legitimate receiver obtains feedback about his past observations and uses it to improve his future decoding attempts. Our main contribution consists in showing that polar codes [2] combined with successive cancellation list decoding [3] achieve rates close to the secrecy capacity when used over channels with feedback. More specifically, we prove that if the number of messages grows exponentially fast as a function of the blocklength then every message can be transmitted reliably using a code whose length scales linearly with the number of messages .\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces some notation and definitions. Section III presents our main theorem. Section IV provides a sketch of the proof of Theorem 3.1. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.",
    "We present new observations of intervening metal systems at z ~ 1.5-2.0 towards the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050525A, which is one of only two GRBs with spectroscopic redshifts known to date. We detect absorption lines due to Mg ii λλ2796, 2803, Feii λ2382, 2344+2600, Ciii λ977, Siiv λ1394, 1403, Ovi λ1032, 1038, Nv λ1239, 1243, Lyα, and Lyβ associated with an absorber at z = 2.01 ± 0.02. This system has log NHI/cm−2 = 19.6 +0.2 −0.1 , corresponding to a total hydrogen column density of 5 × 1020 cm−2 . It also shows strong low-ionization transitions such as Al iii λ1854, 1854 + 1862, and S iv λ1063, 1073 that are not seen in typical high-redshift absorbers. These features suggest that this absorber may be similar to those found along quasar sightlines.",
    "Glutamatergic synapses are the most abundant excitatory connections in the brain, but how they form is not well understood. Here we show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) can be delivered directly to synaptic sites by lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane or indirectly via endocytosis followed by recycling endosomes. We used single-particle tracking with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to follow GluR2-containing AMPA receptors tagged with quantum dots at hippocampal neuron dendrites. The results reveal two distinct trafficking routes for receptor delivery to synapses. First, receptors diffuse laterally along the surface until encountering an existing synapse where they become trapped. Second, receptors enter endosomal vesicles after endocytosis and then recycle back to the cell surface through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes before being targeted to new synapses. These findings provide insights into mechanisms underlying formation of functional neuronal circuits during development as well as plasticity of mature neurons.",
    "We present the results on the unique type Ib supernova (SN) 2005bf in NGC 6946, which is one of only two SNe with an unambiguous association to a gamma-ray burst (GRB). The light curve and spectral evolution are compared with those of other GRB-associated SNe as well as normal SNe Ia and IIb. We find that SN 2005bf shows several unusual features among these objects. In particular, it has a very slow decline rate during its nebular phase, indicating that the ejecta mass may be much larger than expected for ordinary core-collapse SNe. This suggests that the progenitor star was massive enough to form a black hole directly without going through a neutron-star stage. If this is true, we expect that the central engine of the associated GRB would have been powered by accretion onto such a black hole rather than by radioactive decay energy. Our analysis also indicates that the explosion site should be located close to the center of the host galaxy, suggesting that the progenitor system might have experienced significant natal kick before the explosion. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray bursts",
    "We study how classical and quantum uncertainty affect the price dynamics in an incomplete information setting, where agents have access to different sources of information about the underlying state variable. We show that when there is no common knowledge among traders on the true value of the state variable, they may disagree on its expected future evolution even if all are rational and risk-neutral. This disagreement leads to fluctuations in prices which can be amplified by the presence of noise traders who trade based solely on their private signals. In this case, we find that the stock returns exhibit volatility clustering and fat tails similar to those observed empirically. Finally, we demonstrate that these effects persist for both classical and quantum states with non-Gaussian statistics. The results presented here provide new insights into the role played by uncertainty in shaping the statistical properties of asset returns. They also suggest possible avenues for further research aimed at understanding the origin of such phenomena within more realistic models of trading behavior.",
    "We present an algorithm to solve numerically the time-dependent equations describing the growth of ionized regions in the early universe, based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. The numerical solution is obtained by solving simultaneously two coupled partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the ionization fraction and temperature fields inside each cell of a grid covering the computational domain. We show how this method can be used to study the reionization process driven by UV photons emitted by galaxies. In particular we compare our results with those obtained using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics technique. Our tests indicate that both methods are able to reproduce qualitatively similar results but there are some quantitative differences between them which may have important consequences when studying the statistical properties of the IGM during the reionization epoch. \n \n Keywords: Numerical Methods, Computational Science, Cosmology, Reionization",
    "In this work, we propose an approach to human identification based on the analysis of image attributes and their relationships with each other. We use a set of visual features that are extracted by applying state-of-the-art computer vision techniques over images in order to represent them as vectors of numerical values. These feature vectors can be used to train machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random Forests (RF). In addition, we also consider the relationship between these features using Graphical Models (GM), which allow us to learn how they interact with one another. The proposed method is evaluated against two different datasets containing face images captured under controlled conditions. Our results show that our system outperforms existing approaches when identifying individuals across multiple sessions. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation through awards IIS-1253153 and CNS-1527225. In this work, we propose a novel approach to identify humans based on the analysis of their facial appearance. To do so, we extract several visual features from faces using state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Then, we model the interactions among those features using graphical models. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method against two publicly available databases.",
    "We revisit the slow relaxation in a model glass-forming system, namely a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles interacting via a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential with an additional repulsive shoulder at short distances. The main goal is to investigate whether this simple model can reproduce some of the features observed experimentally for silicate melts and glasses such as the stretched exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function or the presence of two distinct time scales in the structural relaxation process. To that end we perform molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations on systems containing up to N = 1000 particles. In particular, by means of MC simulations we are able to study much larger systems than those accessible through MD runs. Our results show that both methods give rise to similar relaxation patterns but there exist subtle differences between them which may be relevant when comparing theory and experiment. Finally, we discuss how our findings compare with previous theoretical predictions based on mode-coupling theories.",
    "We present an analysis of data obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to search for evidence that dark matter particles are being annihilated by collisions at the Galactic Center (GC). We find no significant excess emission above backgrounds, and we set upper limits on the fluxes of gamma rays produced by such processes. These results can be used to constrain models of particle physics beyond the Standard Model which predict the existence of new stable massive particles whose interactions produce gamma-ray signatures similar to those expected from dark matter annihilation products. \n \n The GC is one of the most promising targets for indirect searches for dark matter because it contains large amounts of dark matter concentrated within a small volume. In addition, there may exist astrophysical objects near the GC capable of accelerating cosmic ray protons up to energies high enough to produce gamma-rays through pion decay or inverse Compton scattering off ambient photons. However, these sources could also contribute significantly to any observed gamma-ray signal associated with dark matter annihilation.",
    "We report on the magnetic properties of self-assembled arrays of cobalt (Co) hollow spheres, which are prepared by an electrochemical deposition method onto carbon-coated copper grids. The samples show anisotropic behavior in their hysteresis loops at room temperature as well as superparamagnetic characteristics above 300 K. We also find that the coercivity decreases rapidly when the applied field is parallel to the chain direction but remains almost unchanged for fields perpendicular to it. This indicates that the easy axis lies along the chain direction. In addition, we observe that the remanent magnetization increases gradually up to about 100 Oe after annealing the sample at 400 °C under vacuum conditions. These results suggest that the observed anisotropy originates mainly from shape effects rather than inter-particle interactions. \n \n Keywords: Anisotropy, Cobalt, Hollow sphere, Self-assembling, Superparamagnetism",
    "The Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE) is an important tool in the study of random curves and fractals, especially those arising as scaling limits of discrete models such as lattice paths or self-avoiding walks.  The SLE trace can be thought of as a continuous version of Brownian motion with drift; it has been shown to have connections to many other fields including quantum gravity, string theory, statistical mechanics, probability theory, mathematical physics, number theory, and computer science.   In this article we will give a brief introduction to the basic concepts behind the SLE process, along with some examples that illustrate its use.

    "Muon-catalyzed fusion (MCF) is an exotic nuclear reaction that can be used to produce energy in future reactors, but it requires extremely pure hydrogen gas as fuel.  The MuCap experiment at TRIUMF has developed and tested a novel system for producing ultra-pure hydrogen using liquid helium cryogenic distillation followed by two stages of molecular sieves.  This system produces up to 1 liter per minute with less than 10 parts-per-trillion impurities.  It will provide enough clean hydrogen gas to operate the MuCap experiment until 2020 when the next generation of experiments are expected to begin taking data. A circulating hydrogen ultra-high purification system was designed and built for the MuCap experiment at TRI-UMF. Liquid helium cryogenic distillation is combined with two stages of molecular sieve beds to achieve high purity levels required for MCF research. The system provides up to one litre of purified hydrogen per minute with less than ten parts-per-trillion impurity content.",
    "We present an analytical method to determine the physical properties (size, mass, and density) of exomoons using only their light curves in transits. We show that this method is robust against uncertainties in the planet's orbital parameters by applying it to simulated data sets with different values for the semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination angle, argument of periastron, longitude of ascending node, mean anomaly at epoch, and time of passage through periastron. The results are compared to those obtained when fitting directly for these six orbital elements as well as the moon-to-host radius ratio and moon phase function simultaneously. Our analysis shows that our new method can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the moon's physical characteristics even if its orbit has significant eccentricities or inclinations. \n \n Keywords: Exoplanet, Moon, Transit Timing Variations, Photometry \n \n Transiting planets have been found around more than 1000 stars so far1. Many of them exhibit periodic dimming events caused by moons2-5. These moons may play important roles in planetary evolution6-8 but they cannot be detected via direct imaging techniques because of their small sizes9-11. Therefore, we need other methods to study their physical properties12-14. In particular, the detection of moons around extrasolar giant planets would provide valuable information about how such systems form15-17. \n \n Here we propose a novel approach to estimate the physical characteristics of exomoons based on their light curves alone18-20. This method does not require any prior knowledge of the planet's orbital parameters21-24. It also allows us to detect moons whose orbits are highly inclined25-27 and/or eccentric28-30 relative to the plane of the sky31-33. Moreover, it works equally well whether the moon is tidally locked34-36 or free-rotating37-39. Finally, it provides reliable measurements of the moon's size, mass, and bulk density40-42. \n \n To demonstrate the feasibility of our method, we apply it to simulated data sets generated under various conditions43-45.

    "We present an analytical model to study the effect of mass loading feedback on particle concentration and enstrophy in fully developed turbulence. The cascade process is modeled by using a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are derived based on dimensional analysis and Kolmogorov's similarity hypothesis. We show that the presence of particles can significantly affect both the energy transfer rate between different scales as well as the dissipation rates at small scales. In particular, we find that the total amount of energy transferred into smaller scales decreases when there exists significant mass loading feedback. This result suggests that the presence of heavy particles may lead to reduced turbulent mixing efficiency. Finally, our results also indicate that the effects of mass loading feedback become more pronounced if the Stokes number increases or the initial volume fraction of particles becomes larger. Our findings provide useful insights into understanding how heavy particles influence the dynamics of fluid flows.

    "We present an algorithm for quantum search that is based on the Grover's algorithm and uses only two qubits to represent one item in the database, which can be viewed as a binary number. The algorithm has been implemented using IBM Q Experience simulator with four different databases containing up to 16 items each. We have also compared our results against those obtained by running Grover's original algorithm on the same datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than its classical counterpart when searching through small databases (up to 8 items). However, it becomes less efficient if we increase the size of the database beyond this limit. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP160103745. In recent years there has been significant interest in developing algorithms for performing quantum searches over large data sets [1] . These algorithms are expected to find applications in areas such as machine learning [2] , pattern recognition [3] , computer vision [4] , bioinformatics [5] , etc., where they will allow us to solve problems faster or more accurately [6] .\nIn general, these algorithms use N qubits to encode M elements in the database [7, 8] . For example, Grover's algorithm [9] requires O( √ N/M ) iterations to find any single element out of M elements encoded into N qubits [10] . It should be noted here that the number of required iterations increases exponentially with respect to both N and M [11] . Therefore, these algorithms become inefficient when dealing with very large databases [12] .",
    "Circinus X-1 is an X-ray binary system with a neutron star and its companion, which has been observed in many wavelengths ranging from radio to gamma-ray bands. The source shows periodic dipping activity at X-ray energies that are caused by obscuration of the central X-ray emitting region due to matter falling onto the accretion disk around the compact object. In this work we present results obtained using data collected during two different observational campaigns carried out with Suzaku satellite (from 2005 to 2007) and INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope (from 2003 to 2009). We have analyzed the spectral properties of the source for both observations separately as well as combined together. Our analysis reveals that the spectrum can be described by a combination of several components such as: blackbody emission from the neutron star surface; Comptonized component produced by hot plasma surrounding the neutron star; reflection component originating from reprocessing of hard radiation emitted by the central X-ray source into softer photons; iron line feature arising from fluorescence of cold material located close to the neutron star.",
    "We present an analysis of the basis-set dependence of post-Hartree-Fock (HF) corrections to atomization energies for small molecules, using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions and extrapolation techniques.  We show that the correlation energy contribution is more sensitive than the HF energy to the choice of basis sets used in calculations. The results are compared with those obtained by other authors who have studied this problem previously. Finally we discuss how these findings can be applied to improve the accuracy of thermochemical data calculated at the CCSD(T) level. In recent years there has been considerable interest in improving the accuracy of theoretical predictions of thermochemical properties such as enthalpies of formation or heats of reaction. These quantities are often determined experimentally but it would clearly be useful if they could also be predicted theoretically. One approach which has proved successful involves calculating the total electronic energy E tot [n] of a molecule within some chosen approximation n to quantum mechanics, where n = 1 corresponds to Hartree-Fock theory and n = 2 to second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). Corrections beyond MP2 may then be estimated either by performing higher-level ab initio calculations on smaller subsets of atoms [1] , or alternatively by fitting empirical parameters to experimental data [2] .",
    "We present new observations of three protostellar cores in Orion B, which are among the youngest known prestellar objects. The data were obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm wavelengths as part of an ongoing survey to study the earliest stages of star formation. We find that all three sources show evidence for infall motions on scales ranging between 1000 AU and 10000 AU. In addition, we detect outflows associated with two of these sources. These results suggest that the first phase of star formation is characterized by rapid mass accretion onto the central object through a circumstellar disk. This process may be triggered by gravitational collapse or magneto-rotational instabilities within the core. Finally, our SMA maps reveal extended emission around each source, which could represent either flattened envelopes or disks surrounding the protostar. Our findings provide important constraints on theoretical models describing the early evolution of young stellar objects.",
    "The structure and dynamics of lipid membranes are important for many biological processes, such as cell division or protein transport across the membrane. In this work we use atomic force microscopy to investigate the structural properties of stacked layers of phospholipids in water. We find that these structures form spontaneously on mica surfaces at room temperature within minutes after adding the lipids into solution. The height profiles show that the thicknesses of the individual layers vary between 1 nm and 2 nm depending on their composition. By analyzing the lateral diffusion coefficients of single molecules with respect to time, we can determine whether they are mobile or immobile. Our results indicate that the mobility is strongly dependent on the number of layers present in each stack. For example, while most of the molecules in one layer diffuse freely over large distances, those in two layers exhibit only small displacements perpendicular to the surface. This behavior suggests that the mobility decreases significantly when more than one layer forms.",
    "We study the ground state properties of the spin-1/2 square lattice with nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions and vacancies, using exact diagonalization (ED) on finite clusters up to 12x12 sites. We find that for low concentrations of vacancies there is no significant change in the magnetic order parameter or the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitations as compared to the pure system. However, we observe an increase in the density of states at zero energy when increasing the concentration of vacancies. This effect can be explained by considering the formation of bound pairs of vacancies which are localized around each other due to their mutual interaction. The binding energies of these pairs depend strongly on the distance between them but only weakly on the size of the cluster considered. In addition, we show how this behavior changes if one considers next-nearest neighbor interactions instead of nearest-neighbor ones. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our results.",
    "We present the results of our investigation into accretion disk continuum emission in black hole candidates (BHCs). We have developed an analytical model for calculating the spectrum emitted by a thin, optically thick accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole and applied it to several BHCs with known mass functions. The observed spectra are well reproduced when we assume that the inner edge of the disk is located at 6 gravitational radii. This result suggests that the standard thin disk model can be used as a good approximation for modeling the X-ray continuum emission of these objects. \n \n Keywords: Black holes -- Spectroscopy -- X-rays -- Modeling -- Accretion disks -- Emission lines -- Broad-band spectral energy distribution -- Luminosity function -- Mass measurement -- Stellar-mass black holes -- Supermassive black holes -- Active galactic nuclei -- Quasars -- Cosmic evolution \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable progress made towards understanding the physical processes occurring near supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasars, and other similar systems. These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",
    "We propose an improved metric on the space of worldsheet sigma model couplings that is suitable to study gradient renormalization group flows beyond first order in perturbation theory. The new metric has several advantages over previous proposals, including manifestly positive kinetic terms and no need for additional counterterms at higher orders. We show how this metric can be used to compute beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory using only Feynman diagrams with one-loop vacuum bubbles as building blocks. This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties. In addition we find evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the beta function of the string coupling constant. These results provide further support for the idea that the worldsheet sigma model may serve as a useful tool for studying quantum gravity. Introduction: It was recently shown [1] that the worldsheet sigma-model (WSSM) provides a powerful framework for investigating quantum gravity via its connection to the gravitational path integral [2] . One particularly interesting aspect of this approach is the possibility of computing perturbative corrections to the WSSM action directly from the gravitational path integral without having to resort to explicit calculations involving gravitons or graviton loops [3] .\nIn [4] it was proposed that the WSSM could also be used to investigate the flow of the effective action under the renormalization group (RG). However, since the WSSM contains infinitely many degrees of freedom there does not exist any finite dimensional parameter space where the RG flow takes place. Instead, the RG flow must take place along some infinite-dimensional trajectory through the space of all possible actions. To make progress towards understanding such trajectories it would be helpful if one were able to define a sensible metric on the space of WSSM actions so that distances between different actions could be measured. Such a metric should allow one to determine whether two given actions lie close together or far apart in the space of all possible WSSMs.",
    "We introduce the notion of dynamical objects associated to cohomologically expanding maps, and prove that they are equivalent to the usual ones in many cases.  We also show how these new objects can be used to study the dynamics of such maps on infinite-dimensional spaces. Let X be an infinite dimensional Banach space with norm . For each integer n ≥ 1 we define the open ball B(n) = {x ∈ X : x < n}. A map T : X → X is said to be cohomologically expanding if there exists some constant C > 0 so that for all integers m, n ≥ 1 one has  diam (T −m (B(n))) ≤ Cn. In this case it follows easily that T satisfies the following properties:\n(1)  T is continuous; \n(2)  T is surjective; \nThe main result of our work shows that under certain conditions, the existence of a dynamical object implies the existence of another one which behaves well when restricted to finite-dimensional subspaces. \nLet us now recall what a dynamical object is. Given any point x ∈ X , let O(x) denote the orbit of x; i.e., O(x) := {T k (x), k ∈ Z}. The set O(x) equipped with the metric dO defined by dO((x1, x2)) = sup{d(x1, x2), x1 ∈ O(x2), x2 ∈ O(x1)} becomes a compact metric space called the orbital space at x. If T is cohomologically expanding then every orbital space is homeomorphic to a Cantor set.",
    "We present evidence for dark matter annihilation in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) haze, which is an excess emission at large angles with respect to the Galactic center that was first detected by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use data from Planck and Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), as well as new measurements of the CMB temperature anisotropies made using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).\nThe observed spectrum of this signal can be explained if it originates from dark matter particles with masses between 1 GeV and 10 TeV, annihilating into pairs of photons or leptons. This interpretation requires a boost factor of about 100 relative to standard thermal relic expectations. \n \n If confirmed, our results would provide strong support for models where dark matter self-annihilates into Standard Model particles. They also have important implications on the nature of dark matter itself, since they require either non-thermal production mechanisms or additional interactions beyond those predicted within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.",
    "We report on the detection and characterization of microwave continuum emission from air shower plasmas using data collected by the LOPES experiment in Germany during 2004-2006. The observed signal is consistent with that expected for coherent Cherenkov radiation emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated to energies up to 100 MeV within the showers, as predicted by theory. We find no evidence for any significant contribution from incoherent synchrotron or bremsstrahlung processes. These results provide new insights into the physics of cosmic ray interactions at high energy. They also demonstrate the potential utility of radio techniques for studying atmospheric phenomena such as thunderstorms. \n \n Keywords: Cosmic rays, Radio waves, Air showers, Coherence, Synchrotron radiation \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in developing novel methods for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays based upon their interaction with Earth's atmosphere [1] . One promising technique involves measuring the radio-frequency (RF) emission produced when UHE particles interact with molecules in the upper atmosphere [2] , which can be detected remotely over large areas [3] .\n \nThe most prominent feature of this RF emission is an intense broadband pulse lasting several microseconds [4] . This pulse arises because the charged particle cascade generated by each primary cosmic ray interacts strongly with the geomagnetic field, causing it to emit coherently across a wide range of frequencies [5] . However, other mechanisms may contribute significantly to the total RF emission [6] . \n \n Here we present observations made with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), one component of the International LOFAR Telescope [7] . Our analysis focuses primarily on measurements taken between 2004 and 2006 with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) [8] , a phased array consisting of 144 dual-polarized dipole antennas operating at wavelengths ranging from 10 m to 80 m [9] . During these three years, LWA was deployed near Karthaus Township, Germany [10] , where it recorded signals from more than 20 million cosmic-ray-induced air showers [11] .",
    "We present the first results on the use of infrared calcium lines to determine stellar metallicities in open clusters and field stars, based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph at VLT/UT1 (ESO). We find that the equivalent widths of the two strongest components of the infrared Ca II triplet are strongly correlated with [Fe/H] for both cluster members and field stars.  The calibration is valid over a wide range of temperatures, including those typical of red giants. This method can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the iron abundance even when only low resolution data are available. It also provides an alternative way to estimate distances using parallaxes measured by space missions such as Hipparcos or Gaia.

We formulate this problem as a noncooperative game between users competing for limited power resources under their own constraints on transmission rates and delays. In particular, we show how to compute Nash equilibria of such games using convex optimization techniques. Our numerical results demonstrate significant gains in terms of both network throughput and energy efficiency compared to conventional schemes based on fixed-rate transmissions. The proposed approach also allows us to quantify tradeoffs among different performance metrics, including average packet delay, outage probability, and energy consumption per bit.

    "We study the UV behavior of gauged chiral supergravities in six dimensions, focusing on their possible supersymmetric AdS 7 vacua. We show that these theories are not free at high energies but instead have an interacting fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. This is achieved by using the recently developed technique of holographic renormalization to compute the beta functions of the gauge coupling constants as well as those associated with higher-derivative terms in the action. The latter can be used to stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. In particular we find that there exists a large class of models which admit metastable de Sitter solutions. These results provide further evidence for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS 7 vacuua in this context. Introduction: Recently it has been shown [1] that certain classes of N = 1 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions may be realized via compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds X 3 . It was also found [2] that such constructions generically lead to massive gravitons in five dimensions whose masses scale like M 2 grav ∝ V −3 , where V denotes the volume of X 3 . As a result one expects that the effective gravitational constant G 5 will run logarithmically with energy [3] .\nIn [4] it was suggested that this running could be stopped if one considers non-perturbative effects due to Euclidean D3-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles L ∈ H 4 (X 3 ; Z). Indeed, it turns out that the corresponding instanton contributions generate a term proportional to R ∧ R in the lowenergy effective action [5] . If this term dominates over other contributions then the resulting vacuum solution should correspond to anti-de Sitter space [6] . Moreover, since the instanton contribution scales like e −1/g s , where g s denotes the string coupling constant, one finds that the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space decreases exponentially fast when approaching weak coupling [7, 8] . Thus, in order to obtain a phenomen",
    "We report the discovery of an unusual object in the outer solar system that is likely to be composed primarily of ice particles. The new body, (65489) Ceto/Phorcys, was discovered by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission on September 24th 2010 at heliocentric distance of ~5 AU. It has been observed for more than two years with ground-based telescopes as well as space-borne observatories such as Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory. We present our analysis of these data sets which reveal that this object is a binary Centaur whose components are locked into mutual tidal evolution. This unique combination of properties makes it one of only three known objects in the Solar System where both components have diameters larger than 100 km. Our results show that Phorcys is a very elongated ellipsoidal shape with dimensions of about 400 x 300 x 250 kilometers. Its surface temperature is estimated to be around -100 degrees Celsius.",
    "We report on our analysis of the Suzaku observation of the z = 1.55 quasar, RBS 315 (RA=00h45m53.6s; DEC=-36d19'59.6\"). The source is detected with an average 2-10 keV flux of 4 x 10^-13 erg cm-2 s-1 corresponding to a luminosity of 3 x 10^44 erg s-1 at this redshift. We find that the spectrum can be well fitted by a power law model modified by Galactic absorption plus reflection component using pexrav model in XSPEC. This gives photon index Γ=1.9 +0.2 -0.1 , reflection fraction f=0.7 +1.0 -1.3 . The observed 0.5-7 keV band luminosity is found to be 5x10^43 erg/sec which corresponds to Eddington ratio L/L edd =0.01-0.03 assuming black hole mass M BH ~10 9 M sun .",
    "In this work, we propose an adaptive service provisioning scheme to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees and maximize the network utility by jointly optimizing resource allocation at both base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs). The proposed scheme is based on a communication model that incorporates user mobility into the QoS requirements. We formulate the problem as a joint optimization over BSs' power control variables, MUs' transmission rates, and their association with BSs. To solve it efficiently, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one for each BS and another for all MUs. Then, we develop distributed algorithms to obtain solutions to these problems iteratively using dual decomposition techniques. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than existing schemes under various system settings. In recent years, wireless networks have been widely deployed around the world due to their low cost and easy deployment [1] . However, they are vulnerable to security attacks such as eavesdropping [2] , jamming [3] , and data tampering [4] .\nTo enhance the security level of wireless communications, physical layer security has attracted much attention recently [5] - [8] . Physical layer security exploits the characteristics of the wireless channel to ensure secure transmissions without relying on any additional cryptographic keys or protocols [9] . It was shown in [10] that if the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair shares no common information about the statistical properties of the channels between them and other potential eavesdroppers, then perfect secrecy cannot be achieved even when there exists infinite number of antennas at the transmitter side. Therefore, practical approaches should consider imperfections in the estimation process [11] , limited transmit power [12] , and finite antenna numbers [13] .",
    "SDSS J121811+465501 is an extremely faint galaxy discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). It has been classified as a dwarf elliptical galaxy, but its surface brightness profile shows that it is actually a very extended and diffuse object. We have obtained deep optical spectroscopy for this galaxy using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini North telescope to study its physical properties. The spectrum reveals strong Balmer absorption lines indicating young stellar populations. Its oxygen abundance is found to be one third solar or lower, which makes SDSS J121811+ 465501 the lowest-metallicity galaxy known at z=0.1. This galaxy may represent a population of galaxies formed early during cosmic time when star formation was more intense than today.

    "We consider the problem of linear regression with measurement error, where the errors are assumed to be normally distributed and uncorrelated between different measurements but correlated within each measurement set (i.e., for one given star). We derive an expression for the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters which is valid even if the number of data points per measurement set differs significantly among sets. This allows us to study how the accuracy of the results depends on the distribution of the number of observations over all stars. The derived formula can also be used as a tool for optimizing observational strategies by minimizing the uncertainty of the resulting estimates. In particular we show that it may be advantageous to use only a small fraction of available data points when estimating the coefficients of the model function while using most or all data points for determining its first few derivatives. Finally, we apply our method to simulated data obtained from the Hipparcos astrometric satellite mission.",
    "We present an analytical model for the growth, radial drift and fragmentation of dust grains in protoplanetary disks that evolve under the combined effects of viscous accretion onto the central star and photoevaporation by external radiation fields. We show how these processes affect the evolution of grain size distributions as well as their spatial distribution within the disk. In particular we find that: (i) The maximum grain sizes are limited to values between 1 mm and 10 cm depending on the strength of the stellar UV field. (ii) Grains grow faster at larger distances from the star due to lower gas densities and higher temperatures. (iii) Fragmentation is more efficient closer to the star where the local pressure maxima lead to enhanced collisional velocities.  These results have important implications for planet formation scenarios since they suggest that planetesimals can form only close to the star while large bodies such as asteroids or comets may be able to form farther out in the disk.",
    "We present the results of our analysis on blazars detected by both the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite and the Swift observatory in the first year of operation, 2004-05. We find that there are no significant differences between the two samples when we compare their distributions for redshift, luminosity distance, radio flux density at 1 GHz, optical magnitude, or X-ray photon index. The only difference is found to be in the distribution of redshifts; this may be due to selection effects caused by the different energy bands used by each instrument. \n \n Keywords: Blazar, Swift, WMAP, survey, cosmology, statistics, gamma-ray bursts, galaxy clusters, dark matter, dark energy, neutrino mass, cosmic microwave background radiation, anisotropies, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing, relativistic jets, quasar, active galactic nuclei",
    "We present the mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the central region in the Virgo galaxy cluster, obtained with Spitzer/IRS at high spatial resolution. The MIR emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features and silicate absorption bands that are spatially extended over several kpc scales along the minor axis of the galaxy. We find evidence for an additional component to this emission which peaks on top of the nucleus within 0.5 arcsec (0.1 pc). This nuclear source has been previously detected as a compact radio core and near-infrared continuum source but not seen before in the infrared spectral domain. It shows strong PAH emission lines and weak fine-structure line emission. In addition we detect a number of other sources in the field-of-view including two bright starburst galaxies located about 10 arcmin away from M87. These results show that the MIR properties of active galactic nuclei can be studied even if they reside in crowded fields such as those found near the center of rich clusters like Virgo.",
    "Image registration is an important problem in medical imaging and computer vision, where the goal is to find a transformation that aligns two or more images taken at different times and/or by different sensors. In this work we present evolutionary optimisation methods for template based image registration problems. We consider both rigid and non-rigid transformations between images. The proposed algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real world datasets including brain MRI scans and CT angiography (CTA) volumes. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy while being computationally efficient. This research was supported by EPSRC grant EP/N014560/1. Keywords: Evolutionary Computation, Registration, Non-Rigid Transformation, Rigid Transformation, Brain Imaging, Computer Vision. 1 Introduction Image registration is one of the most fundamental tasks in many areas such as medical imaging [1] , remote sensing [2] , video processing [3] , etc., which aims to find a spatial transformation T that maps each point x ∈ Ω1 = [0, 1]d into its corresponding location y = Tx ∈ Ω2 = [0, 1]d in another image I(y). Here d denotes the dimension of the space. For example, if T1 and T2 denote two consecutive time points in a dynamic sequence of images then finding the optimal transformation T would allow us to track the movement of objects over time [4] . Similarly, if S1 and S2 represent two views of the same scene captured using cameras with slightly differing orientations then registering these images will help us fuse information across multiple viewpoints [5] .\nIn recent years there has been significant interest in developing fast and accurate registration algorithms [6] - [8] . However, despite considerable progress made towards solving this challenging problem [9] - [11] , it remains unsolved due to several factors including large number of degrees of freedom involved [12] , presence of noise [13] , partial occlusions [14] , lack of feature correspondence [15] , etc..",
    "We study the dynamics of open quantum systems in one dimension, focusing on their ability to generate entanglement between distant sites and how this is affected by decoherence.  We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum information processing requires the manipulation of quantum states over large distances. However, due to inevitable interactions with the surrounding environment, such operations cannot be performed perfectly. Here we investigate whether certain types of environments may actually enhance the performance of quantum devices.",
    "We present new high angular resolution observations of the massive protostellar system, Orion Source I (OSI), obtained with ALMA in Band 7 and 9 at an average spatial resolution of 0.3 arcsec. We detect emission lines of SiO(5-4) and HCO+(4-3). The observed line profiles are consistent with those expected for Keplerian rotation around a central object of mass ~10 Msun. Using these results we derive physical parameters such as disk inclination angle, radius, temperature, density structure etc., which can be used to test theoretical models of circumstellar disks. In addition, we find that the kinematics of the innermost region probed by our data is dominated by infall motions rather than outflowing gas. This suggests that OSI may have recently undergone rapid accretion onto its central star. Finally, we also report detection of two compact continuum sources within the primary beam of the telescope.",
    "We present the equation of state (EoS) for isospinasymmetric nuclear matter within the framework of relativistic mean field theory, including both nucleons and hyperons as well as their interactions via meson exchange. We consider two different parameterizations of the EoS: NL3* and TM1. The former one includes non-linear terms in the scalar self-interaction potential while the latter has been fitted to reproduce properties of finite nuclei. In addition we also study the effect on the EoS when using the so-called \"chiral limit\" instead of the standard values for the coupling constants between baryons and mesons. This work is motivated by recent experimental results obtained at GSI Darmstadt which suggest that the symmetry energy may be much softer than previously thought. It will allow us to make predictions about the composition of neutron stars and its dependence on the density profile inside these objects. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained recently by other authors.",
    "We present an analysis of the stability of planetary systems in which protoplanetary embryos evolve under oligarchy, i.e., they are able to eject each other's neighbors by gravitational scattering but not themselves. We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",
    "We use hydrodynamic simulations to study how proto-clusters grow and evolve into galaxy clusters, focusing on their baryon content at high redshifts (z > 5). We find that most of these regions are highly ionized by z = 3 due to photo-heating by UV background radiation. The resulting low neutral hydrogen fraction leads to an under-density of absorbers along the line-of-sight towards such objects compared with lower redshift observations. This effect is more pronounced for higher mass halos which have larger gas fractions than less massive ones. Using this result we derive constraints on the abundance of high-redshift proto-clusters as a function of halo mass. These results can be used to test models of structure formation and reionization. In addition they provide useful input parameters for future studies of cluster scaling relations using weak lensing techniques. \n \n Keywords: Hydrogen ionization state, Galaxy Cluster, Reionization",
    "We study holographically the confinement/deconfinement phase transitions of strongly coupled gauge theories on curved spaces by using the gravity dual with dilaton and axion fields, which is obtained as an exact solution to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion system in five dimensions. We find that the critical temperature for deconfinement decreases when we increase the curvature radius at fixed chemical potential or charge density. This result implies that the effect of gravitational backreaction becomes more important near the horizon than far away from it. In addition, we show that the critical temperature increases monotonously with increasing chemical potential (or charge density) at fixed curvature radius. The results are consistent with those found in flat space-time. Finally, we discuss how our results can be applied to QGP produced in heavy ion collisions. PACS: 04.50.+h, 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Mh",
    "We study the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states for some classes of potentials in the presence of an external magnetic field, using results on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to Schrödinger equations obtained by J. Bourgain and M. Goldstein.  We consider potentials which are bounded below but not necessarily convex or even continuous; we also allow the external magnetic fields to be time-dependent (but still periodic). In particular, our results apply to the case where the potential is given by the sum of a quadratic form plus a small perturbation. The main tool used here is the so-called ``Bourgain-Goldstein method'', which consists in studying the evolution of the Wigner transform of the solution to the Schrödinger equation under the action of the unitary group generated by the corresponding Hamiltonian. \nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this article is to prove that there exists at most one equilibrium state associated to certain classes of potentials in the context of quantum mechanics when these potentials interact with an external magnetic field. This result was first proved by D. Ruelle [Ru] , who showed that if V : T d → R satisfies suitable conditions then there exists exactly one equilibrium measure µV . These assumptions include the fact that V should have superlinear growth at infinity and satisfy a condition known as ``uniform ellipticity''. However, it turns out that many interesting examples do not fall into this category. For example, let us mention the following two examples:  • If V = −|x| 2 + |y| 2 , then V does not grow faster than linearly at infinity.",
    "We present the fundamental plane (FP) for galaxy clusters detected in the Planck survey at 143 GHz, based on their X-ray luminosity Lx , temperature Tx and SZ flux Y500 . The FP is defined as log(Y500 ) = α + βlog(Tx /Lx ), where we find that the best-fit values are  α = 0.92 ± 0.01 and β = 1.27 ± 0.02 with an intrinsic scatter of σint = 0.10 ± 0.03 dex.  We compare our results to previous studies using different cluster samples and methods. Our sample consists of 31 massive clusters selected by applying cuts in mass M500 > 5 × 1014 h−1 70 M⊙ and redshift z < 0.3. These clusters have been observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites and also with ground-based telescopes such as APEX-SZ or Bolocam.",
    "We present the results of our analysis of pulsar data obtained with the LOFAR telescope in the Netherlands, which is part of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). The observations were carried out at frequencies between 10 MHz and 120 MHz using the High Band Antenna (HBA) system. We have detected two new types of pulsars - one that emits bursts of radio waves lasting several seconds and another whose pulses are modulated by an additional signal. In addition to these discoveries we also report on the detection of previously unknown phenomena associated with known pulsars. \n \n Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars emitting beams of electromagnetic radiation across the entire visible universe. They can be observed over many decades as they spin down due to their magnetic dipole field losing energy into space. This causes them to slow down gradually until they stop completely after about ten billion years. As well as being extremely stable clocks for measuring time intervals, pulsars provide information about fundamental physics such as gravity, quantum electrodynamics and general relativity.",
    "We present the results of our analysis of molecular gas mass estimates based on CO and HCN observations in nearby galaxies, using data obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope. We find that conversion factors between luminosity and mass are strongly dependent on the star formation rate (SFR) per unit area within each galaxy disk. The SFR surface density is found to be an important parameter controlling the conversion factor XCO = M(H2)/L(CO), which we derive by fitting the observed L(HCN) / L(CO) ratio versus metallicity relation. For low values of ΣSFR < 1M⊙ yr-1 kpc-2 , corresponding to quiescent disks or nuclear regions dominated by old stellar populations, we obtain XCO ≈ 2 × 10 20 cm−2 K−1 km−1 s. This value increases up to XCO ≈ 5×10 20 cm−2 K−1km−1s at high ΣSFR > 3M⊙yr-1kpc-2 . These findings suggest that the physical conditions of the interstellar medium may change significantly depending on whether it is located in actively star-forming regions or not.",
    "We study the wetting properties of a fluid in contact with an attractive wall, using a simple model for which we can perform exact calculations. The system consists of particles interacting via a hard-core repulsion and a short-range attraction that decays exponentially fast at large distances. We show how to calculate exactly the density profile near the wall as well as the surface tension between the liquid phase and the gas phase. In particular, we find that there is no true equilibrium state corresponding to complete wetting by the liquid phase; instead, the interface becomes rough when the temperature decreases below some critical value T*. This phenomenon occurs because the exponential tail of the interaction potential leads to strong fluctuations in the number of particles adsorbed onto the wall. These fluctuations are responsible for the non-analytic behavior observed both in the density profile and in the surface tension. \n \n Introduction \n \n Wetting phenomena occur whenever two phases coexist in contact with each other [1] . For example, water droplets spread over glass surfaces due to capillary forces [2] , while oil spreads out on top of water [3] . A particularly interesting situation arises if one of these phases has a lower dimensionality than the others [4] . Indeed, this may lead to new types of transitions such as those occurring in systems where a thin film coexists with its vapor [5] or in confined geometries [6] . \n \n Here we consider a simple model describing the wetting properties of fluids in contact with walls [7, 8] . Our results suggest that even though the interactions decay rapidly away from the wall, they still give rise to nontrivial effects. More specifically, our analysis shows that the presence of a wall induces strong fluctuations in the number Nw of particles adsorbed on it [9] . As a result, the interface separating the liquid phase (containing all particles) from the gas phase (containing none) becomes rough [10] when the temperature drops below a certain threshold T*. Below T*, the average distance between neighboring particles increases significantly so that the interface acquires a fractal structure [11] . \nModel description\n\nThe system under consideration consists of N identical",
    "The magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes for understanding many phenomena observed in space and laboratory plasmas, such as solar flares, magnetospheric substorms, sawtooth crashes in tokamaks etc.. In this work we present an analytical model which describes the process of magnetic reconnection in collisionless high energy plasma with arbitrary initial conditions. The main idea behind our approach consists in using the concept of generalized force density tensor (GDFT) introduced by MHD theory. We show that GDFT can be used not only to describe the macroscopic dynamics but also microscopic properties of the system like particle distribution functions. Our results are compared with those obtained within other approaches based on kinetic description of particles motion. It turns out that all these models give similar predictions when applied to simple cases where the initial state has no gradients along the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field. However, if there exist some gradients across the magnetic field lines then different models predict quite different behavior.",
    "We present the results of our survey for southern M-dwarf binaries with separations between 0.1 AU and 10 AU, using data obtained by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board HST as part of program GO-12775. We find that about half of all systems are unresolved or only marginally resolved at these distances. The fraction of close binaries is higher among lower mass objects than it is among more massive ones; we estimate that this difference may be due to observational biases rather than intrinsic differences in formation mechanisms. \n \n In addition, we have identified several new candidate companions around known nearby ultracool dwarfs: GJ 436Bb, GJ 581Cc, GJ 674Ab, and GJ 758Aa. These candidates will require further observations before their status can be confirmed.

    "We present an efficient numerical scheme to solve the incompressible Navierstokes (NS) equations by using the lattice Boltzmann method with the Inverse Kinetic Approach (IKA). The IKA is based on the idea that the NS equation can be recovered as the equilibrium state in the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and it has been successfully applied to various fluid dynamics problems. We show how this concept can be implemented into the LBM framework. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Finally we discuss some possible extensions of the current work. Keywords: Lattice Boltzmann Method; Inverse Kinetic Approximation; Incompressible Navier-Stokes; Computational Fluid Dynamics. 1 Introduction The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), originally developed by Frisch et al [1] , is one of the most promising approaches to computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is particularly suitable for parallel computing due to its inherent locality [2] . Recently there have been many successful applications of the LBM to different types of flow problems [3] .\nThe basic idea behind the LBM is to represent the distribution function f(x,t) at each node x of a regular grid by a finite number of particles moving along discrete velocities c i = ciΔt/Δx, where Δx and Δt denote respectively the spatial and temporal resolutions [4] . Then the evolution of these particles is governed by the following equation: \nwhere τ denotes the relaxation time which controls the rate of approaching towards the equilibrium distribution function f eq i\n. By choosing appropriate values of τ, the macroscopic quantities such as density ρ and velocity u can be obtained through moments of the distribution function:",
    "We present new results on the kinematics and dynamics of spiral arm streaming motions in the nearby grand-design galaxy NGC 5194 (M51). We use high-resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopy obtained with SINFONI at VLT to study the gas velocity fields, line-of-sight velocities, and mass surface density distributions along two different lines of sight through the central region of this interacting system. The main goal is to investigate whether or not there are systematic differences between these two viewing angles that could be related to an underlying gravitational potential perturbation caused by the companion galaxy NGC 5195. Our analysis shows that both sides of the nuclear ring exhibit similar large-scale streaming patterns which can be traced out to distances of about 1 kpc into the disk plane. However, we find significant deviations from circular rotation within the inner 100 pc radius around the nucleus. These non-circular motions appear to be dominated by radial inflow towards the center as well as counter-rotating components perpendicular to the major axis of the galactic bar.",
    "We present new optical/NIR data for GRB 060206, which show that its X-ray to radio afterglow is well described by an achromatic break at tbreak = 1.3 days followed by a power-law decay with index -1.2 (Fν ∝ t-1.2). The lack of any spectral evolution across this break suggests it was caused by energy injection into the blast wave. We find no evidence for dust extinction along our line-of-sight; however we cannot rule out significant reddening due to host galaxy dust. Our results are consistent with previous claims that achromatic breaks observed in many other bursts may be explained as being due to late-time energy injections rather than jet-break effects. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, Afterglow emission, Energy injection, Jet break, Redshift measurement \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how gamma ray bursts (GRBs) produce their broadband electromagnetic radiation. This effort has led to several successful models describing the prompt phase of GRB emission (see e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but less progress on explaining the origin of the afterglow component. A key feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or 'jet break' in the light curve around one day postburst (Rhoads 1999) . Such breaks have traditionally been interpreted as marking the time when the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, causing the flux density to drop rapidly. However, some authors argue that such breaks can also arise if the ejecta undergoes continued energy input following the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000) , while others suggest that they could instead result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008 ). An alternative explanation for these breaks invokes interstellar scintillation (Goodman 1997; Goodman & Narayan 2006 ) - a phenomenon",
    "We present the first measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function for both early-(elliptical/S0, Sa-Sb) and latetype (Scd-Sm) galaxies using data from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC). We use two different methods to measure SMBH masses - stellar velocity dispersion measurements and bulge luminosity scaling relations. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the SMBH mass functions of these galaxy types at z < 0.1. However we find evidence for an evolution with redshift such that the number density of massive SMBHs decreases more rapidly than less-massive ones. This suggests that the most massive SMBHs are likely to have grown by accretion over cosmic time rather than merging events. These findings will be important constraints on models of SMBH growth and AGN feedback.",
    "We present the results of our analysis on the statistical properties of dust FIR emission in nearby galaxies, based on data obtained by ISO and Spitzer space telescopes. We find that the distribution function of dust FIR luminosity is well described by a log-normal form with an exponential tail at high luminosities. The mean value of the logarithmic luminosity dispersion for all samples considered here is 0.3 dex (factor of 2). This result suggests that there are two populations of dusty star-forming regions within each galaxy -one population associated with normal star formation activity and another one associated with intense bursts of star formation. Our study also shows that the fraction of galaxies containing such extreme objects increases towards higher redshifts. These findings have important implications for understanding the physical processes responsible for the evolution of distant galaxies as well as their contribution to the cosmic infrared background radiation. \n \n Keywords: Infrared, Galaxy",
    "We present the Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity with matter fields on an arbitrary spacetime manifold, including both classical and quantum aspects. The basic idea is to use the ADM decomposition of the metric into space and time components as well as lapse and shift functions. We then introduce canonical momenta conjugate to these variables which are used to construct the primary constraints of the theory. These constraints generate gauge transformations under which all physical quantities must be invariant. In order to obtain the correct number of degrees of freedom we have to impose secondary constraints that eliminate unphysical modes. Finally, we perform the canonical quantization by promoting the phase-space variables to operators acting on wave-functions defined over superspace (the space of all possible metrics). This leads us to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation whose solutions can be interpreted as probability amplitudes between different states of the universe. We also discuss how this approach could be applied to inflationary models.",
    "We propose an algorithm for network tomography that is able to reconstruct the internal structure of a network by using only one-dimensional (1-D) measurements, i.e., link counts between pairs of nodes in the network. The proposed method can be applied to any type of networks and does not require any prior knowledge about their topology or traffic patterns. We show how our approach can be used to estimate the number of active flows at each node as well as the amount of data transmitted over each flow. Our results are validated through extensive simulations performed with real Internet traces. Network tomography has been widely studied during recent years due to its potential applications in many areas such as computer security, quality-of-service provisioning, and traffic engineering [1] . In this context, it consists of estimating some properties of the network's internal state (such as the number of active flows per node or the amount of data transferred along each flow) by observing only external information (i.e., link-level statistics). This problem becomes particularly challenging when dealing with large-scale networks since the number of possible states grows exponentially with the size of the network [2] .\nIn order to overcome these limitations, several approaches have been recently proposed which exploit specific characteristics of the underlying network [3] , e.g., sparsity [4] - [6] , symmetry [7] , or regularity [8] . However, most existing methods assume either complete knowledge of the network topology [9]- [11] or accurate estimates of the traffic matrix [12] - [14] . Unfortunately, both assumptions may not hold in practice [15] , especially if we consider large and/or dynamic networks [16] . For example, in IP-based networks, the exact location of routers cannot always be determined [17] while the traffic matrix is usually unknown [18] . Moreover, even if the network topology were known, collecting all necessary information would still be impractical because of scalability issues [19] . Finally, obtaining accurate estimates of the traffic...",
    "We propose an algorithm to select the injection point in hybrid networks, which is based on local information and can be implemented with low overheads. The proposed algorithm has two phases. First, it elects one node as the injection point by using only local information. Second, if there are multiple nodes that have been elected as the injection points, then these nodes will negotiate among themselves to determine exactly one injection point. We prove that our algorithm always selects at least one node as the injection points when all nodes are reachable from each other. Furthermore, we show through simulations that our algorithm performs well even under various network conditions such as dynamic topologies or limited communication ranges.

    "We present new high resolution (R = λ/Δλ ~ 20,000) far-ultraviolet spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), as well as archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data for the hot white dwarf central star in the planetary nebula Sh2-216. The FUSE spectrum shows numerous absorption lines due to highly ionized species such as C IV, N V, O VI, Ne VIII, Mg X, Si XII, S XIV, Ar XVI, Fe XIX, and Ni XXVIII. We have modeled these features using synthetic line profiles generated by the non-LTE model atmosphere code TLUSTY/SYNSPEC. Our best-fit models indicate that this star has an effective temperature T eff = 120,000 K, surface gravity log g = 8.0, mass M = 0.6M☉ , radius R = 0.01R☉ , and is surrounded by a shell of material with density n(He II)/n(He I) = 1.5 x 10-3 .",
    "The Earth's rotation axis is not fixed, but wobbles around its mean position with respect to distant stars (polar motion). The amplitude and phase of this wobble are determined by many factors including tidal forces between the Earth and other bodies such as the Sun and Moon.  Free Core Nutation (FCN) refers to an oscillation of the Earth's spin axis that occurs at a period of about 430 days. This phenomenon has been observed for more than 50 years using ground-based radio telescopes observing the positions of celestial objects near the celestial poles. In this study we use data spanning over 30 years obtained from two observatories located on opposite sides of the globe to investigate how FCN varies spatially across the surface of the Earth. We find that there exists significant differences in both the amplitudes and phases of the FCN signal recorded at each site. These results suggest that the FCN signal may be modulated by local geophysical effects which vary across the Earth's surface.",
    "We present an approach to robust multi-cellular developmental design that combines the advantages of both bottom-up and top-down approaches, while avoiding their respective disadvantages. The proposed method is based on a novel concept called \"embryonic development space (EDS)\" which represents all possible designs in terms of cell types and connections between them. We show how EDS can be used for efficient exploration of different designs by applying evolutionary algorithms. Finally we demonstrate our approach using two case studies - one synthetic and another biological. Robustness has been recognized as one of the most important features of living systems [1] . In particular, it plays crucial role during embryogenesis when cells differentiate into various tissues and organs [2] , but also later in life [3] .\nIn this work we propose a new computational framework for designing robust multicellular systems. Our approach combines the advantages of both \"bottom-up\" [4] and \"top-down\" [5] methods, while overcoming some of their limitations. Bottom-up methods are typically applied to model cellular differentiation [6] or morphogenetic processes [7] . They usually start with a single cell type and then evolve towards more complex structures through successive divisions and/or mutations [8] . Top-down methods use genetic programming [9] or other optimization techniques [10] to search for optimal solutions within pre-defined constraints [11] . However, these methods often require extensive tuning of parameters [12] and may get stuck at local optima [13] .\nOur approach uses a novel concept called \"embryo-",
    "We present the results on X-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass fraction and YX (the product of these three quantities) for a sample of 62 galaxy clusters observed with XMM-Newton. We find that our data are consistent with self-similar evolution at low redshifts but show deviations from it at higher redshifts. The deviation is more pronounced when we use the SZ signal to estimate cluster masses instead of using the X-ray temperatures. This may be due to non-thermal pressure support or biases introduced by different selection effects between X-ray and SZ surveys. Our results suggest that the scatter around the mean relation increases towards high redshift. We also investigate how well the scaling relations can be used as cosmological probes. Using the current observational constraints on the Hubble constant H0 = 73 km s-1 Mpc-1 , matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.27 and dark energy equation-of-state w = -1, we find that the uncertainty in the derived values of Omega_m and w is dominated by systematic uncertainties rather than statistical errors.",
    "The SNO+ experiment is designed to measure the neutrino fluxes in the energy range between 1 MeV and 20 MeV, with an expected sensitivity at low energies comparable to that achieved by Super-Kamiokande (SK). The measurement will be performed using two detection techniques: charged-current interactions on deuterium nuclei via elastic scattering off electrons; neutral current reactions on carbon nuclei through coherent elastic scattering off neutrons. \n \n In this work we present results for the predicted rates of these processes as well as their uncertainties based on state-of-the-art Standard Solar Models (SSMs) and nuclear cross sections. We also discuss how the experimental data can help to constrain SSM parameters such as the helium abundance YHe or the heavy element abundances Z/X. Finally, we show how the combination of different experiments may allow us to test whether the observed neutrinos are produced mainly in pp-chain fusion reactions or in CNO cycles.",
    "We present an accurate analytical model for the description of optical precursors in ultrashort laser pulses propagating through dispersive media, which is based on the concept of nonlinear phase modulation by self-phase-modulation (SPM) and cross-phase-modulation (XPM). The proposed approach allows us to describe accurately both the temporal shape as well as the spectral content of these phenomena. We show that this new method can be used to predict the appearance of weak-field coherent optical transience (WFCOT), i.e., the generation of sub-femtosecond bursts of light with high peak power at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of the pulse. This prediction is confirmed experimentally using a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond oscillator operating at 800 nm central wavelength. Finally we demonstrate how our results are relevant for applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy or attosecond science. \n \n Optical precursors have been observed since the early days of ultrafast optics [1–3] . They appear when short intense laser pulses propagate through dispersive media like glass fibers [4] , air [5] , water [6] , crystals [7, 8] , etc.. These effects were first explained theoretically by assuming that the propagation of the pulse was governed by the slowly varying envelope approximation [9] . However it has recently become clear that this assumption does not hold true anymore if one wants to explain the details of the experimental observations [10–12] .\n \nIn order to overcome this limitation several authors have developed more sophisticated models [13–19] . In particular, the so-called generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) [20, 21] has proven very useful because it takes into account all orders of dispersion [22] , self-steepening [23] , third-order dispersion [24] , Raman scattering [25] , stimulated Brillouin scattering [26] , self-frequency shift [27] , plasma defocusing [28] , gain saturation [29] , and other higher-order effects [30] . \n \nHowever, despite its successes, there still remain some discrepancies between theory and experiment [31] . For example, the GNLSE predicts that the intensity profile of the precursor should always exhibit a smooth bell-shaped structure [32]",
    "We present the results of long-term numerical simulations of binary black hole (BBH) evolution, including gravitational radiation reaction and general relativistic effects such as frame dragging and tidal disruption. We focus on binaries with total mass M = 100-1000M⊙ that evolve through collisional nuclear environments at high redshifts z > 10. Our main goal is to study how BBHs can grow by accretion during their early stages of evolution when they are surrounded by dense gas clouds. In particular we investigate whether these systems can reach masses above 1000M⊙ before merging within a Hubble time. The initial conditions for our models were obtained using Monte Carlo sampling of the distribution function of isolated BBHs constructed by Belczynski et al. (2010) . For each model we performed several runs starting from different orbital configurations. All calculations were carried out assuming circular orbits. We find that most of the massive binaries merge within a few hundred million years after formation due to emission of gravitational waves. However, some of them survive until today if they form in regions where the density of surrounding gas exceeds $10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$. These binaries may be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave observatories like LISA or DECIGO/BBO.",
    "The Axion Dark Matter Search (ADMX) experiment is designed to search for dark matter in the form of axions, which are hypothetical particles predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model.  The ADMX experiment consists of two main components: an antenna and a microwave cavity system that can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies.   In this thesis we present results obtained with the first phase of the experiment using data taken between September 2005 and March 2007.    We report limits on the coupling strength of axions to photons as well as limits on the mass of axions produced via Primakoff conversion inside a strong magnetic field.  These results improve upon previous experimental bounds by more than one order of magnitude. This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344. The Axion Dark Matter Search experiment is designed to search directly for dark matter in the universe in the form of axionic particles. The experiment consists of two main parts: an antenna and a microwave resonator system that can be tunable across a large frequency range. In this dissertation I will discuss our recent results from the first stage of the experiment.",
    "We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the result of collisions between primordial black holes and stars in globular clusters, which occur at rates predicted by current models for GRB production.  We show how this scenario can explain many observed properties of GRBs including their duration distribution, luminosity function, redshift evolution, and beaming fraction.   The proposed model also predicts an observable population of binary systems containing both a star and a PBH, which may provide additional tests to distinguish it from other scenarios. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Figure 1 ) are intense flashes of high-energy radiation lasting only milliseconds up to several minutes [1] . They have been detected out to redshifts z = 8 [2] , corresponding to ages of less than one billion years after the Big Bang [3] .\nThe most popular explanation for these phenomena is that they arise when extremely massive stars collapse into black holes [4] or neutron stars [5] . However, there are some difficulties associated with this picture [6] :  First, the rate of such events required to produce all known GRBs exceeds predictions based on stellar formation theory [7]; secondly, the energy released during the explosion does not appear sufficient to power the brightest GRBs [8] ; thirdly, the number density of very massive stars decreases rapidly towards higher redshifts [9] , whereas observations suggest that the rate of GRB production increases [10] .  Finally, if GRBs were produced solely through collapsars then we would expect them to be distributed randomly throughout space; however, recent studies indicate that they tend to cluster together [11] .\nIn order to overcome these problems, alternative explanations involving mergers of compact objects [12] , tidal disruption flares [13] , and hypernovae [14] have been suggested. In addition,...",
    "We study the effects of noise on spatially extended systems by using an extension of the concept of nonequilibrium potential (NEP). We show that NEPs can be used to characterize different types of stochastic resonances, such as those observed for excitable and bistable systems near their respective Hopf bifurcations. In particular we find that the presence of noise enhances the amplitude of oscillations in both cases but with very different mechanisms. For excitable systems this is due to the fact that noise increases the probability of crossing the threshold between two stable states; while for bistable systems it occurs because noise induces transitions between these states. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous studies based on other approaches. Stochastic resonance has been studied extensively during recent years [1] . It refers to the phenomenon whereby weak signals can be enhanced or detected more easily when they are embedded into a noisy background [2] .\nIn many physical situations, however, one needs to consider not only the effect of external noise sources but also internal fluctuations arising from the dynamics itself [3] . This problem becomes particularly relevant if the signal-to-noise ratio is small [4] , which may occur either because the signal is intrinsically weak or because its intensity is comparable to the level of intrinsic noise [5] . Moreover, even though the signal is strong enough so that it could be clearly distinguished without any additional noise [6] , there might still exist some optimal amount of noise that maximizes the detection efficiency [7, 8] .",

It also discusses how astronomers are working together to make use of these vast resources. In particular I describe my own work on studying galaxy clusters as dark matter halos, measuring their masses through gravitational lensing effects, and determining their evolution across cosmic time. Finally, I discuss plans for future surveys which will build upon SDSS's successes.

    "BiFeO3 is an antiferromagnetic insulator with high Curie temperature (TC = 1103 K) that exhibits ferroelectricity at room temperature when doped or under pressure. Here we report the observation of spontaneous magnetization, M(T), and electrical polarization, P(E), simultaneously existing over wide ranges of temperatures up to 300 K in pure BiFeO3 single crystal grown by flux method. The results show that both M(T) and P(E) are nearly independent on each other below TC but they start to decrease rapidly above TC. We also found that the magnitude of M(T) decreases faster than that of P(E). These observations suggest that there exists strong coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in this material. \n \n Keywords: Room-temperature multiferroic materials, BiFeO3, Electric polarization, Magnetic properties, Flux growth technique.",
    "We present the results of an investigation into the physical properties of weak Mg II absorbers (WAs) in quasar spectra, using high-resolution spectroscopy and photoionization modeling. We find that WAs are typically associated with galaxies having stellar masses M* ~ 10^10 to 10^11 solar masses, star formation rates SFR = 0.1-10 Msun/yr, and metallicities Z = 0.2 - 1 times solar metallicity. The majority of these systems have low ionization parameters log U < -2.5, indicating they are likely dominated by diffuse gas rather than dense clouds. These findings suggest that WAs may be related to galactic winds driven out of star-forming regions. In addition we find evidence for two distinct populations of WAs; one population is characterized by relatively strong absorption lines which appear to arise primarily within galaxy halos, while another population has weaker absorption features which seem to originate closer to the central region of their host galaxies.",
    "We present an algorithm to find galaxy groups using photometric redshifts, which is based on the Voronoi tessellation technique (VT). The VT method has been widely used for identifying clusters of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts but it had not yet been applied to identify galaxy groups with photometric redshifts. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release five (SDSS DR5) as our input sample. Our results show that the VT method can be successfully applied to identify galaxy groups even when only photometric redshifts are available. In this work we have identified more than 12000 galaxy groups at 0 < z < 0.3. These groups contain about 30000 member galaxies. We also provide a catalog containing basic information such as positions, magnitudes, colors, and photometric redshifts for all these groups. \n \n Keywords: Galaxy Group, Photometric Redshift",
    "In this work, we consider a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system where each transmitter has limited feedback information about its channel state to the receiver. We assume that there is no cooperation between transmitters in terms of power allocation or transmission strategies. Each transmitter can only adjust its own transmit power level based on local CSI knowledge at the transmitter side. In addition, each transmitter may turn off its radio completely when it does not have any data to send. The objective is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing both the power control policy as well as the transmission strategy for all users simultaneously under these constraints. \n \n First, we derive an upper bound on the achievable sum-rate using finite-rate feedback assuming Gaussian codebooks. Then, we propose two algorithms to solve the optimization problem numerically. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the performance gain achieved by our proposed algorithm over existing schemes.",
    "The vortex dynamics is studied numerically for fractal cluster structure (FCCS) superconductor by solving time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under an external magnetic field. The FCCS has been proposed as one possible candidate to explain the origin of high-Tc cuprates, and it consists of randomly distributed clusters which are connected each other via Josephson coupling. We find that the resistivity increases rapidly when the applied current exceeds some threshold value Ic(H), where H denotes the strength of the external magnetic field. This behavior can be understood by considering the motion of vortices inside the clusters. In addition, we show that the critical current density Jc decreases gradually with increasing temperature T . Finally, we discuss how these results may be relevant to experiments on high-Tc cuprate superconductors. PACS: 74.20.-q; 74.25.+s; 74.60.Bz; 74.70.-k",
    "The Kuiper belt is the source region for most short period comets, but its formation remains poorly understood. We present results from N-body simulations that show how collisions among planetesimals in Neptune's feeding zone can produce objects with orbits similar to those observed today. The initial conditions are based on models of planet migration during which Neptune migrated outward by about 30 AU before being halted at its current location. Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper belt formed as a result of collisional grinding between bodies whose sizes were comparable to Pluto (r ~ 1000 km). This process produced a population of small bodies with orbital eccentricities ranging up to 0.3. Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these bodies to be scattered into highly eccentric orbits. These results provide an explanation for why there appears to be no correlation between the size distribution of KBOs and their orbital eccentricity.",
    "We study the effect of temperature dependent shape anisotropy in an exchange coupled system consisting of two identical uniaxial single domain particles, one being magnetically softer than the other and both having their easy axes parallel to each other. We show that for certain values of the parameters involved there is a significant increase in the coercive field at low temperatures compared to high temperatures. This can be understood by considering the competition between the Zeeman energy barrier due to the applied magnetic field and the thermal activation energy barrier associated with the temperature dependence of the shape anisotropy. \n \n The model we consider consists of two identical spherical particles (with radius R) separated by a distance d along the z-axis. Each particle has its own uniaxial anisotropy constant Ks(T), where T denotes the temperature. In addition, they are also exchange-coupled through a coupling constant J. For simplicity, we assume that the anisotropy constants have the same functional form as given below, \n \n Ks = K1 + K2 tanh[-(T/Tc)],\n \nwhere Tc is some characteristic temperature scale which determines how rapidly the anisotropy changes with temperature.",
    "We present an exact quantum-mechanical treatment for the dynamics of open systems in which the system is coupled to many harmonic oscillators representing its surrounding environment.  We show that, under certain conditions, this model can be reduced exactly into a master equation with Lindblad form. The resulting master equations are used to study the effects of environmental fluctuations on the evolution of the density matrix describing the state of the system. In particular we consider two different models of environments corresponding to Ohmic dissipation and spin-boson interaction respectively. For both cases it is shown how the effect of the environment leads to irreversible loss of information about the initial state of the system as well as to thermalization at late times. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to problems such as transport through mesoscopic conductors or dissipative tunneling between localized states in disordered solids. Decoherence and relaxation processes play a crucial role in understanding the physics of open quantum systems [1, 2] . These phenomena arise when the system interacts with some external degrees of freedom (environment) whose influence cannot be neglected [3] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in developing theoretical methods capable of treating these effects beyond the perturbative regime [4] . A number of approaches have been proposed ranging from phenomenological treatments based on stochastic Schrödinger equations [5] , to more microscopic descriptions using path integral techniques [6] or field-theoretical formulations [7, 8] . However, despite their successes, all these methods suffer from one common drawback: they do not provide any insight into the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for decoherence and relaxation; nor do they allow us to make quantitative predictions regarding the time scales involved [9] .\nRecently, several authors [10 -12] have suggested that the problem may be tackled within the framework of quantum mechanics itself. This idea was first put forward by Feynman [13] who showed that the statistical properties of macroscopic objects could be obtained by averaging over an ensemble of identical but microscopically distinct realizations of the same experiment. More recently, Leggett [14] introduced a method...",
    "We present new results on the properties and evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Coma cluster, based on deep HST/ACS imaging data obtained as part of our ongoing survey for faint globular clusters associated with ETGs.  We find that the majority of brightest cluster members are elliptical or lenticular galaxies, while only one galaxy is classified as an S0/a galaxy. The fraction of S0s increases towards fainter luminosities, reaching about 50% at M V = −18 mag. This result suggests that most S0s were formed through morphological transformation of late-type spirals during their infall into the cluster environment. In addition to this morphological transformation scenario, we also consider other possible mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas and tidal interactions between galaxies. By comparing the observed number density profiles of globular clusters around different types of ETGs, we show that there exists no significant difference among these three populations.",

Theoretically, there exist two types of tunneling processes [6] : extrinsic tunneling which occurs when particles move through barriers created by external potentials [7, 8] ; and intrinsic tunneling where particles tunnel between degenerate states without any potential barrier [9] . Intrinsic tunneling plays important roles in many physical systems such as molecular vibrations [10] , nuclear fission [11] , Josephson junctions [12] , Bose-Einstein condensates [13] , and semiconductor superlattices [14] .

    "We study the phase behavior and structure of binary mixtures composed of soft repulsive spheres with attractive depletants, which are modeled as hard-spheres that interact only via excluded volume interactions. We find that these systems exhibit rich phase diagrams including gas-liquid coexistence at low temperatures for all compositions studied here (0.25 < f < 0.75), where f is the fraction of particles made up by the smaller species. The liquid-gas binodal lines shift to higher pressures upon increasing the size ratio between the two components. For large size ratios we observe an additional fluid-fluid transition line along which both fluids have similar densities but different structures. This new fluid state has been observed experimentally in colloidal suspensions containing nonadsorbing polymer chains. Our results show good agreement with experimental data on colloid-polymer mixtures over wide ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe presence of small particles can dramatically affect the properties of larger ones through depletion forces [1] . These effects play important roles in many physical phenomena such as protein crystallization [2] , gelation [3] , and sedimentation [4] .\nDepending on their sizes relative to each other, the mixture may be either miscible or immiscible [5] . In addition, there exist regions of metastability [6] and even multiple phases [7, 8] . A number of theoretical studies [9] - [11] have investigated the effect of depletion attractions on the phase diagram of simple model systems. However, most of them focused on idealized models neglecting hydrodynamic interactions [12] , finite-size effects [13] , polydispersity [14] , and particle shape [15] . Only recently did some authors [16] take into account more realistic features like Brownian motion [17] , electrostatic repulsion [18] , and van der Waals attraction [19] . Despite this progress, it remains difficult to predict the exact location of the critical point [20] due to strong correlations [21] among the particles [22] . Moreover, the influence of depletion forces on the structural [23] and dynamical [24] properties of complex fluids still needs further investigation [25] .\nIn recent years, experiments [26]",
    "The detection and study of cosmic rays is one of the main goals for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The background produced by these events can be reduced using different techniques, such as cuts on shower parameters or image cleaning algorithms. In this work we present an alternative method to reduce the background based on machine learning techniques. We use Random Forest classifiers trained with simulated data to identify cosmic-ray images among all recorded IACT images. This approach allows us to obtain results similar to those obtained with other methods but at lower computational cost.

We use archival data obtained at the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4m telescope as well as new observations taken during our own observing runs between 2005-2007. Our analysis is based on two-dimensional fitting of exponential disk models using GALFIT. In addition we perform bulge-disk decomposition using two different methods. First, we fit Sérsic profiles to both components simultaneously. Second, we apply an iterative method where we first subtract the best-fit model from each image before performing another round of fits. This procedure allows us to study the properties of individual galaxy components separately. For all but one object we find that the results are consistent within the uncertainties.",

    "The Standard Model (SM) is an extremely successful theory, but it leaves many questions unanswered about physics at very high energies. In particular, there are no known fundamental principles that can explain why the SM has three generations of quarks and leptons with such different masses or how gravity fits into this picture. Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to address these issues by introducing new particles and/or interactions which may be observed in future experiments.  Supersymmetry (SUSY), for example, introduces partners for all SM fields whose spin differs by one half unit. These partner states have identical gauge quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, so they could mix with them if SUSY were broken at low energy scales. This mixing would lead to deviations from SM predictions for observables like cross sections and decay rates. Many extensions of the Standard Model also predict new phenomena associated with extra dimensions of space-time. For instance, theories based on string/M-theory often contain additional spatial dimensions compactified down to tiny sizes. If these extra dimensions exist, then we should see evidence of their effects through virtual exchange of Kaluza-Klein excitations of gravitons and other particles between SM fields localized on our four-dimensional world-volume.",
    "We present an algorithm that determines whether or not there exists a quantum circuit with a given number of qubits and gates, such that the corresponding time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable by a physical system in which each energy level has at most one excited state.  We also show how to find all possible circuits if they exist. Our results are based on recent work showing that any time-independent Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of commuting projectors onto its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to reduce the problem of finding a realization of a general time-independent Hamiltonian into several instances of the same problem but restricted to smaller Hilbert spaces. The reduction yields a polynomial-time algorithm when applied recursively. Finally we discuss some applications of our method including determining the minimum depth required for universal adiabatic quantum computers. In this article we consider the following problem: \nGiven a set of n qubits and m two-qubit gates, does there exist a quantum circuit consisting only of these gates whose associated time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable; i.e., it corresponds to a Hermitian operator acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? If so, what is the smallest circuit size needed?\nThe answer to this question will depend on the specifics of the model used to describe the physical system under consideration. For example, in the case where each energy level may have more than one excited state (i.e., degenerate), then no circuit can realize the desired Hamiltonian unless it contains infinitely many gates. On the other hand, if each energy level has exactly one excited state (i..",
    "We present an analysis of the alignments between galaxy spins and tidal fields in real space, using data from the Two Mass Redshfit Survey (TMRS). We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors' positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al. (2008) used SDSS DR4 data to investigate the alignments between galaxy spin vectors and their nearest neighbor's position angles. They found no",
    "We present an equation-of-state (EOS) model for solar matter that is based on the path integral formalism and includes quantum nuclear effects in the form of shell corrections, which are calculated using realistic nuclear interactions. The EOS covers densities ranging from 0 to 1.5 times normal density at temperatures between 10^6 K and 5×10^8 K. We compare our results against those obtained by other authors who used different methods or approximations. Our new EOS agrees well with previous calculations within their respective domains of validity but extends these into previously unexplored regions. In particular we find that the pressure increases more rapidly than predicted by standard models when approaching the center of the Sun. This leads to higher central temperatures and lower radii compared to standard models. These differences may be important for understanding the structure of stars like the Sun as well as for modeling stellar evolution. \n \n Keywords: Solar interior",
    "We present new results on the faint-end slope and evolution of the luminosity function (LF) for optically-selected quasars in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.2, based on the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). We use two different methods to estimate the LF parameters at each redshift bin: 1/Vmax method and maximum likelihood fitting technique. Our best-fit values are obtained by combining these two techniques with Monte Carlo simulations. We find that our data is consistent with previous studies within their uncertainties. However we show that there exists an apparent discrepancy between the observed number density of bright quasars and the predictions made using the standard quasar formation model. This may be due to incompleteness effects or biases introduced during the selection process. In addition, we also investigate the dependence of the LF shape on the optical luminosities of quasars.",
    "We present results on polarized radio emission in the field surrounding the galaxy cluster Abell 2218, observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz. We detect 16 compact sources above 5 mJy beam-1 at both frequencies; all but one are unresolved or marginally resolved by our observations. The majority have fractional linear polarization between 10% and 20%, while two objects show higher values up to 40%. All detected sources appear to be associated with galaxies within the central region of Abell 2218. In addition we find evidence for diffuse polarized emission around the brightest member of this galaxy cluster. This is likely due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven into the intracluster medium during multiple mergers that occurred over time scales ranging from 10 Myr to several Gyrs ago. Our data also reveal an extended halo-like structure which surrounds the entire galaxy cluster.",
    "We report on an exceptional flare detected by Swift/XRT at t ~ 1 day post-burst, which lasted for more than 100 ks (~20 hr). The flare was followed up with observations performed with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn between 2.5 days to 3 months post-burst. We find that this flare is best described as a superposition of two components: one component lasting about 50 ks peaking around 10^-3 s and another component lasting about 70 ks peaking around 5 x 10^4 s. Both components are well fitted by exponentially cut-off power-laws with photon indices Γ = -1.6 ± 0.1 and -2.2 ± 0.3 respectively. No significant spectral evolution during either of these flares has been found. This flare is among the most energetic ever seen in any gamma-ray burst.",
    "We study theoretically the influence of longitudinal magnetic fields in coronal loops on the damping rate of small amplitude prominence oscillations. We find that for sufficiently large values of the longitudinal magnetic field, the damping is dominated by resonant absorption and it increases with increasing longitudinal magnetic field strength. For smaller values of the longitudinal magnetic fields we find that the damping is due to phase mixing between Alfvén waves propagating along neighboring flux tubes. In this case the damping decreases as the longitudinal magnetic field becomes weaker. The results are compared with observations made at the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) instrument aboard SOHO spacecraft. It has been known since the early 1980s that many prominences exhibit periodic transverse displacements which can be observed both in Hα images and in EUV lines formed higher up in the atmosphere than Hα . These motions have periods ranging from several minutes down to about one minute and amplitudes typically less than 100 km s-1 .\nTheoretical models suggest that these oscillations may be driven by slow magnetoacoustic waves trapped inside the prominence body or by fast kink modes excited by photospheric flows (see e.g., Oliver & Ballester 1994; Terradas et al. 2002) . However, there is still no consensus regarding what causes them.",
    "We present results on flame evolution during type Ia supernova (SN) explosions, based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with detailed nuclear reaction networks for both deflagrations and detonations. We find that the transition to detonation is triggered by shock-induced turbulent mixing at densities around 10$^{9}$ g/cm$^3$. The resulting detonation wave propagates through the entire white dwarf star within about 1 s after ignition. In this scenario, the observed light curve can be reproduced if we assume an initial central density of 2 x $10^8$ g/cm$^3$ or higher. For lower values of the central density, the explosion fails to produce enough 56Ni to explain observations. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX10AD03G.

    "We report the observation of dynamic condensation of water vapor on crack tips during slow fracture experiments performed under vacuum conditions (10-6 mbar) and low temperature (77 K). The condensed water is found to be localized along the crack front, where it forms a thin film that covers the entire surface of the crack tip. This phenomenon has been observed for cracks propagating both perpendicularly and parallel to the direction of maximum tensile stress. We propose a model based on molecular dynamics simulations which explains this effect by considering the presence of an electric field generated by the moving crack tip. In addition we show how the formation of such films can affect the mechanical properties of the material. Condensation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature but have rarely been reported in materials science. Here we present experimental evidence showing that water condenses onto the crack surfaces when they propagate through fused silica glasses. These results were obtained using a combination of optical microscopy techniques with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), Raman spectroscopy and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS).",
    "We study lattice chiral gauge theories with Wilson fermions in four dimensions, focusing on their phase structure at finite temperature T . We show that there is no spontaneous breaking of parity (P) or time-reversal symmetry (T ) for any value of the bare quark mass m0 if the number Nf of flavors satisfies Nf > 2. This result implies that the theory does not have an order parameter associated to P and/or T , which are spontaneously broken by the standard model. In particular, we find that the spectrum contains two degenerate Dirac fermion species corresponding to left-handed and right-handed quarks, respectively. These fermions can be identified as mirror fermions because they transform into each other under reflection about one spatial axis. The existence of these mirror fermions leads to interesting consequences such as the absence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by gluons. \n \n Introduction \n \n Chiral gauge theories play important roles both theoretically and phenomenologically. They provide a natural framework for describing low-energy phenomena involving hadrons [1] . On the other hand, it has been suggested recently that some extensions of the Standard Model may contain extra space-time symmetries beyond Poincaré invariance [2] . It would then be very useful to develop techniques to analyze the possible effects of such new symmetries on physical observables [3] .\n \nIn this Letter, we consider a class of chiral gauge theories defined on a Euclidean spacetime lattice [4] . Our main interest lies in studying how the presence of additional discrete symmetries affects the phase diagram of the system. For simplicity, let us first focus on the case where only parity (P), charge conjugation (C), and time reversal (T ) transformations act nontrivially on fields [5] . Then, the action S = d4 x L(U; ψ,ψ) should satisfy the following conditions [6] :",
    "We present chemical abundances for stars in three halo globular clusters (M92, M15, and M68) based on high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with HIRES at Keck Observatory. We find that these clusters have very similar abundance patterns to those observed among field halo stars; they are all metal-poor, α-enhanced systems. The mean [Fe/H] values we derive range between -2.3 dex and -1.9 dex depending upon which cluster is considered.  These results confirm previous suggestions that there may be no significant differences between the properties of the stellar populations found within individual open or globular star clusters versus those found in the general Galactic halo population. In addition, our derived ages suggest that these clusters formed early during the formation history of the Galaxy. Finally, we compare the kinematics of these clusters to those of other nearby halo objects such as dwarf galaxies and ultra-faint dwarfs.",
    "We present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete computer network in which each node is connected to all nodes within its distance, and also to some other nodes at larger distances. The number of additional connections per node increases exponentially as one moves away from it along any path. We show that this property can be used to construct efficient routing tables for such networks. Our results are based on a new concept called \"expanding dimension\". This concept allows us to define a natural hierarchy among the nodes of our network. In particular, we prove that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm for finding shortest paths between two given nodes then there must exist another polynomial time algorithm for solving the same problem but restricted only to pairs of nodes whose distance belongs to a certain range. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these ideas to distributed computing problems. Keywords: Computer network, Expanding Dimension, Hierarchy, Routing",
    "We study heavy quarkonium transitions to hybrid mesons by using the multipole expansion method within the framework of nonrelativistic potential models. We calculate decay widths for various types of transitions, including E1, M1, E2, M2, E3, M3, E4, M4, and S-wave pion emission processes. The results are compared with available experimental data as well as theoretical predictions based on other approaches such as lattice gauge theory. \n \n In addition we determine mass spectra of hybrids by solving Schrödinger equations numerically. It is found that our calculated masses agree reasonably well with those obtained recently by lattice gauge theories. Finally, we discuss possible production mechanisms of hybrid states at future experiments. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 10675040.

    "We present 8.4 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images and light curves for the supernova remnant (SNR) associated with the Type IIb supernova SN2004et, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 on 2004 September 24 UT1. The radio emission is dominated by two bright components separated by ~0.5 arcsec at all epochs observed between 2005 January and 2007 December. We find that both components are expanding with velocities of ~5000 km/s, consistent with previous estimates based on single-dish data. However, we also detect significant proper motions of ~1000 km/s for each component over this period. These results suggest an age of about 3 years for the SNR, implying a distance to NGC 6946 of 4 Mpc. This value is significantly smaller than previously estimated distances to this object using other methods. Our measurements provide new constraints on models of core-collapse supernovae. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnants",
    "We present an ab initio study of the structure, energetics, and dynamics of water adsorbed on the MgO(001) surface in the submonolayer regime using density functional theory with van der Waals corrections. We find that the most stable configuration is one where each oxygen atom binds to three hydrogen atoms forming a trihydrogen bridge between two adjacent O atoms. The binding energy per molecule for this configuration is 1.6 eV. This value agrees well with previous theoretical results obtained within the generalized gradient approximation but disagrees significantly with experimental values which are typically larger by about 0.5-0.7 eV. Our calculations show that the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to the neglect of dispersion interactions in earlier studies. In addition we have studied the effect of temperature on the stability of different configurations. We found that the relative population of various structures depends strongly on the temperature.",
    "We study the sound propagation through a one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Einstein condensed gas trapped by an optical lattice potential and interacting with each other via contact interactions. We show that, for weak interaction strength, there is no phonon-phonon scattering between different bands due to the energy gap induced by the periodic potential. In this case, we find that the sound velocity can be obtained analytically using perturbation theory. For strong interaction strengths, however, the phonons are scattered into higher bands and thus the sound velocity decreases as compared to its non-interacting value. The results agree well with numerical calculations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. PACS numbers: 03.75.Dg, 05.30.Jp, 37.10.Gh \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe properties of superfluid helium have been studied extensively since it was discovered more than half century ago [1] . One of the most important features of superfluids is their ability to support dissipationless flow without friction [2] , which has led to many applications such as superconductors [3] .\nRecently, ultracold atomic gases confined in optical lattices provide another platform to explore quantum fluids [4] . These systems exhibit various phases including Mott insulator phase [5] , supersolid phase [6] , and even topological states [7, 8] . Moreover, they allow us to tune the system parameters continuously [9] and observe directly the evolution of physical quantities [10] . This makes them ideal candidates to investigate new phenomena predicted by theoretical studies [11] .\nIn particular, bosonic atoms in optical lattices may form a BoseEinstein condensate [12] . It is known that these condensates behave like superfluids [13] . Recently, several experiments have observed the superflow [14] and vortex [15] in these systems. However, unlike conventional superfluids, the condensates in optical lattices also interact strongly with each other [16] . Therefore, understanding how the interatomic interactions affect the collective excitations becomes crucial [17] .\nIn this work, we consider 1D Bose-Einstein condensates trapped by an optical lattice [18] .

    "We present an analysis of the gravitational waveforms emitted by two neutron stars orbiting each other, and show that they can be used to detect violations of Lorentz invariance (LI). We consider both scalar-tensor theories with spontaneous breaking of LI as well as vector-tensor theories where LI is violated through the presence of a preferred reference frame. In these models we find that there are characteristic deviations from general relativity which lead to measurable differences between the observed gravitational waveform and those predicted within Einstein's theory. \n \n The detection of such deviations would provide strong evidence for new physics beyond standard model expectations. This could have important consequences on our understanding of fundamental interactions at high energies. For example, it may shed light on the origin of dark energy or even reveal the existence of extra dimensions of space-time. It also has implications for cosmology since many extensions of the Standard Model predict time variations of physical constants like Newton's constant G.",
    "We present the chemical properties (metallicity, abundance ratios) for a sample of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume with known distances and star formation histories. We use high quality spectra obtained at the Apache Point Observatory to derive oxygen abundances using both direct T e method as well as strong-line methods calibrated on H II regions in nearby spiral galaxies.  The derived metallicities range between 12+log(O/H)=7.6-8.2 dex. These values are consistent with those found by previous studies based on optical spectroscopy. In addition we find that most of these dwarfs have supersolar N/O ratio indicating recent or ongoing nitrogen enrichment due to massive stars. This is also supported by their low SFRs which prevent efficient dilution of the enriched gas produced by supernovae type Ia. Finally, we compare our results with theoretical predictions made by different chemical evolution models. Our analysis shows that none of them can reproduce simultaneously all observed quantities such as metallicity, N/O ratio and sSFR.",
    "We present the Nobeyama CO (J=1-0) atlas for nearby spiral galaxies, which is based on our previous work by Kuno et al. (1995) . The sample consists of 45 barred and nonbarred spirals with distances less than 30 Mpc. We have observed these galaxies at an angular resolution of about 3 arcsec using the NRO 45 m telescope. In this study we use only those data points that are detected above 5 sigma level to make maps of molecular gas distribution. These maps show clearly that there exists a difference between barred and unbarred spirals: while most of the barred spirals exhibit strong concentration of molecular gas along their bars, such concentrations do not appear in many cases of unbarred spirals. This result suggests that the presence or absence of a bar may be one of the important factors determining the structure of galactic disks. It also indicates that the formation mechanism of bars should be different from that of bulges. \n \n\nThe authors acknowledge support from Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 08540349), Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Japan.",
    "We present an analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of galaxies within galaxy clusters, using data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We use this information to measure the degree of radial bias in the distribution of cluster member velocities as well as their spatial correlation function. The results are compared against predictions made by cosmological N-body simulations that include both baryonic gas and collisionless dark matter particles. Our main conclusions are:  1) Galaxy clusters exhibit significant deviations from isotropic dynamical equilibrium; 2) These deviations can be explained if we assume that the dark matter component has a radially biased velocity dispersion tensor; 3) This result implies that the dark matter halos surrounding individual galaxies have similar shapes but different orientations relative to each other. In addition, our measurements provide new constraints on the mass-to-light ratio for galaxy clusters. Using HST observations of four nearby galaxy clusters, we find evidence that the dark matter component exhibits a strong radial bias in its velocity dispersion tensor.",
    "We present an exact solution to the classical equations of motion in two dimensions, which is interpreted as describing a rotating black hole with angular momentum J = M . The metric has the form ds2 = −dt2+(1+cosh2r)dθ2−r2dr2,\nwhere r and θ are polar coordinates on the plane. This solution can be obtained by performing a duality transformation on the usual BTZ black hole (with no rotation). We show that this new solution satisfies all the required physical conditions at infinity. In particular we find that it describes a regular black hole horizon located atr+ = √3M , where M is the mass parameter appearing in the original BTZ solution. Finally, we discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years there have been many attempts to construct solutions to Einstein's field equations corresponding to rotating black holes [1] - [4] . One particularly interesting class of such solutions was found by Bañados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ), who showed how one could obtain a static black hole solution in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time [5] .\nThe most important feature of these solutions is their asymptotic behaviour; they describe black holes whose event horizons are completely determined by global quantities like total energy or charge [6] . However, despite being very useful tools for studying quantum gravity phenomena [7, 8] , these solutions do not provide any information about local properties of the spacetime near the horizon [9] . It would therefore seem desirable to try to extend them into more complicated geometries containing additional parameters characterizing the internal structure of the black hole [10] .\nOne way of doing so is to consider higher-dimensional extensions of the BTZ solution [11] . Another possibility is to perform a duality transformation on known solutions [12] . For example, if we start with the Schwarzschild solution written in terms of spherical coordinates, then after applying a suitable coordinate transformation we will get another solution expressed in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates [13] .",
    "The extraction of fresh water and energy from the atmosphere is proposed as an alternative to conventional sources, which are limited in supply or environmentally damaging.  The process involves condensing atmospheric moisture into liquid water using solar power and then collecting this water on a surface coated with hydrophobic materials that allow it to be easily transported by air currents.   This technology could provide clean drinking water for remote communities without requiring large amounts of land area or infrastructure investment. It also has potential applications in agriculture where irrigation can be provided at low cost through the use of wind-driven sprayers. In addition, the collected water may be used directly as fuel if combined with electrolysis cells powered by renewable electricity. The process requires minimal maintenance once installed and would operate continuously over many years. A pilot-scale demonstration system was constructed near Tucson Arizona (USA) during 2011-2013. The results show that the system produces up to 1 gallon per day of potable water under favorable conditions.",
    "We have analyzed the redshifts of two samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with different luminosities and found evidence for intrinsic redshift components in both cases.  The first sample consists of 12 Seyfert galaxies, which are luminous AGNs with broad emission lines. We find that their observed redshifts can be decomposed into an extrinsic component due to gravitational lensing by foreground objects and an intrinsic component whose amplitude is correlated with the widths of the broad emission lines. This correlation suggests that the intrinsic redshift may arise from Doppler shifts associated with outflows or inflows of gas on scales comparable to those probed by the broad-line region. The second sample contains low-luminosity quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 quasar catalog. These quasars show no obvious signs of being gravitationally lensed but do exhibit significant intrinsic redshift components. In this case we find that the amplitudes of these components correlate strongly with the optical continuum slopes measured at rest-frame wavelengths near 3000 Å .",
    "The measurement calculus is an extension to the standard quantum mechanics formalism that allows for measurements on composite systems, and it has been used in several recent works as well as in this thesis.  The main idea behind the measurement calculus is to consider all possible outcomes of a measurement process as separate states of the system being measured instead of just one outcome (as done by von Neumann). This approach leads naturally to considering the set of all possible measurement results as a new state space called the effect algebra. In addition, the measurement calculus provides a way to describe how different measurement processes can be combined into more complex ones using so-called instruments. Finally, the measurement calculus also includes a description of what happens when we perform a measurement on a system whose state is not known exactly but only up to some uncertainty. The measurement calculus was first introduced by Aharonov et al., and since then there have been many papers written about its properties and applications.",
    "We study nonequilibrium spin dependent transport properties of normal-metal-superconductor (NS) and ferromagnet-superconductor (FS) hybrid systems by using the quasiclassical theory for diffusive conductors with spin-orbit scattering. We show that, due to the proximity effect induced pair correlations between electrons on opposite sides of NS interface, there is an additional contribution to the current density which depends on the relative orientation of magnetizations in F and S layers. This results in appearance of the anomalous Josephson-like current-phase relation in FS junctions. In addition we find that the Andreev reflection at NS interfaces can be strongly suppressed if the angle between magnetization directions in N and S regions becomes sufficiently large. The suppression of Andreev reflection leads to the reduction of conductance through NS junction as compared to its value in equilibrium state. \n \n Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our predictions.",

    "The authors present an analysis of the stochasticity inherent to biochemical reactions, and its effects on metabolic networks. They show that this noise can be reduced by increasing enzyme concentrations or decreasing reaction rates; however, these strategies are limited because they may lead to other undesirable consequences such as increased production costs for enzymes or decreased growth rate due to slower metabolism. The authors also discuss how their results could help explain why some organisms have evolved mechanisms to reduce the amount of noise in their metabolic processes (e.g., gene regulation). Finally, they suggest possible extensions of their work including studying more complex models with multiple species participating in each reaction.

    "We introduce the notion of covering homology, which is an extension of ordinary homology to infinite graphs and simplicial complexes. The main idea behind this concept is that we consider not only finite subcomplexes but also their infinite analogues - so-called coverings. We show how covering homology can be used for studying properties of infinite graphs such as amenability or hyperbolicity. In particular, we prove that if a graph has infinitely many ends then its first covering homology group vanishes. This result generalizes the classical theorem by Stallings on groups with infinitely many ends. Covering homology provides us with new tools for investigating various classes of infinite objects in mathematics. It turns out that it is closely related to other concepts like equivariant homology theory (in the case when our object admits actions of some group) or higher-order algebraic K-theory. Finally, we present several examples illustrating applications of covering homology.",
    "We present new molecular opacity tables that include all relevant molecules in cool, carbon-rich stellar envelopes and are valid over a wide range of temperatures (T = 1000 - 10000 K), densities (ρ = 10 −10 -10 6 g/cm 3 ) and compositions (C/O=0.5-2). The calculations were performed with the state-of-the-art ab initio line-by-line radiative transfer code SPECTRUM using extensive laboratory data on molecular lines as well as theoretical predictions based on quantum chemical methods. We have calculated synthetic spectra for several model atmospheres representative of red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to demonstrate how our new opacity tables affect their structure and evolution. Our results show that the inclusion of additional species such as SiO, TiO, VO, FeH, MgS, NaCl, CaF, AlO, CrH, MnS, CoO, NiO, ZnS, ZrO, BaO, LaO etc., which are not included in previous studies, leads to significant changes in the atmospheric structure and consequently affects the predicted surface abundances of CNO elements during the third dredge-up phase.",
    "We present the relativistic second order perturbation theory for fluids in curved space-time with arbitrary number of components. We derive the general expression for the energy-momentum tensor at first order in perturbations as well as its trace-free part which is responsible for gravitational waves generation. The evolution equations are derived by projecting the conservation law onto the background 4-velocity vector field. In particular we show that the presence of anisotropic stress leads to an additional source term in the equation governing the evolution of scalar modes. Finally, we discuss how our formalism can be applied to study different physical situations such as inflationary models or dark matter halos formation. Cosmology has been revolutionized over the past decade thanks to precision measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation [1] . These observations have provided us with detailed information about the early universe and allowed to test fundamental physics on very large scales [2] .\nThe standard model of cosmology assumes that the universe consists of several interacting components including cold dark matter (CDM), baryons, photons, neutrinos etc.. Each component evolves according to some set of hydrodynamical equations describing their dynamics [3] . However, these equations cannot be solved analytically even if one neglects all interactions between particles [4] , so numerical simulations are required [5] . On the other hand, analytical solutions exist only under certain approximations [6] . For example, it was shown recently [7, 8] that the effect of pressure gradients may lead to significant corrections to the growth rate of density perturbations during the late stages of structure formation [9] .",

    "We present an analysis of all known short-period cataclysmic variables (CVs) in which we find that most systems have orbital periods longer than 3 hrs and are dominated by SW Sex stars, while those with shorter periods tend to be AM Her binaries. We show that this dichotomy is consistent with theoretical predictions for the evolution of CVs driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation. The observed distribution of orbital periods can also be explained if there exists a minimum period below which no CVs exist due to magnetic braking. This result has important implications on our understanding of how CVs evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), interacting binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting matter from its low-mass companion through Roche lobe overflow, are among the best studied classes of close binary stars. They provide unique opportunities to study many aspects of astrophysics such as stellar structure and evolution, mass transfer processes, nuclear burning at high temperatures, and relativistic effects near compact objects. In particular, they offer insights into the formation mechanisms of both single and double degenerate white dwarfs, the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.",
    "We present the results of an analysis of galaxy cluster data in terms of their gravitational lensing properties and X-ray emission, with particular emphasis on the comparison between observed and predicted values for the mass-to-light ratio M/L. We find that the best-fit value of this quantity is consistent with the predictions based on standard CDM models if one assumes that most of the baryonic component of these systems resides within galaxies rather than being distributed throughout the intracluster medium (ICM). This result suggests that the ICM may be heated by some mechanism other than gravity alone. \n \n Keywords: Galaxy cluster, Dark Matter Halo, Gravitational Lensing, Mass-to-Light Ratio, X-Ray Emission \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n The study of galaxy clusters has been instrumental to our understanding of cosmology over the past few decades. In fact, it was through observations of galaxy clusters that we first discovered evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter [1] . Today, galaxy clusters are still used extensively to test theories about structure formation [2] , and they provide important constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant [3] or the equation-of-state parameter w [4] . \n \n However, despite all its successes, there remain several open questions regarding galaxy clusters which have yet to be answered satisfactorily. For example, while current observational techniques allow us to measure accurately the total amount of light emitted by a galaxy cluster, it remains difficult to determine how much of this light comes from stars inside individual galaxies versus diffuse gas located outside them [5] . Similarly, although we can estimate fairly well the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster using various methods [6] , it is not clear what fraction of this mass is associated with visible objects like galaxies [7, 8] . Finally, even though we know that galaxy clusters contain large amounts of hot plasma [9] , it is unclear whether this material is gravitationally bound to the system [10] .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we will use two different datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory [11] : the sample of galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et",
    "We present new maps of the circumstellar SiO (v=1, v=2) masers around the Mira variable R Leo obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array at 22 GHz and 43 GHz. The observations were carried out on September 24th 2004 using all ten antennas available for VLBA operation during that time period. We detect two distinct groups of masers: one group is located near the star's position as determined by optical astrometry; another group lies about 0.5 arcsec to the south-west of this location. Both groups are associated with an extended bipolar structure seen in previous single-dish observations. This structure has been interpreted as a shell-like envelope surrounding the central star. Our results show that both groups of masers trace different parts of this shell-like structure. In addition we find evidence for a third component which may be related to the presence of a companion object. \n \n Keywords: Masers",
    "We present an evolutionary algorithm for the problem of mesh numbering, which is to assign integers in the range [0, ..., n-1] to all vertices of a given graph G = (V, E) such that adjacent vertices have consecutive numbers and no two edges share the same pair of endpoints with the same order.  The proposed method uses a population-based approach where each individual represents a valid solution by means of a permutation vector. We show how this representation can be used to efficiently compute fitness values using only local information. In addition we propose several genetic operators to explore the search space. Finally, we report on preliminary results obtained by applying our method to some well-known benchmark instances. Keywords: Graphs, Optimization problems, Evolutionary algorithms, Genetic algorithms. 1 Introduction A common task when working with graphs is to label their nodes or edges with unique identifiers. This process is known as node or edge numbering respectively. For example, it may be required to number the nodes of a road network so that every path between any two points has a unique sequence of labels. Another application arises in circuit design, where one needs to assign unique addresses to components of electronic circuits.",
    "We report on the experimental demonstration of frequency upshift in two colliding laser pulses using a relativistically flying mirror (RFM). The RFM is realized as an ultrathin foil accelerated to high velocities by intense femtosecond laser pulses focused onto it at grazing incidence angle. We show that the collision between the counter-propagating laser pulses leads to the generation of new frequencies, which are shifted towards higher values compared to those generated without the presence of the RFM. This effect can be explained within the framework of nonlinear optics and quantum electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the possibility for generating high-energy photons via collisions of laser pulses in vacuum. These findings may have important implications for future applications such as particle acceleration or gamma-ray sources based on table-top experiments. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying the interaction of ultra-intense lasers with matter under extreme conditions [1] . One particular area of research focuses on the investigation of novel phenomena associated with the propagation of light in vacuum [2] , where the effects of strong field QED [3] become relevant [4] . For example, the emission of energetic electrons [5] and positrons [6] into vacuum was observed experimentally [7-9] when intense laser pulses were focused onto thin foils [10] . Moreover, the production of energetic photons [11] and pairs [12] in vacuum was predicted theoretically [13-15] .\n \nIn this Letter we present our experimental study of another interesting phenomenon related to the propagation of light in vacuo -the so-called relativistic tennis [16] . It consists of two counterpropagating laser pulses interacting with each other inside a vacuum chamber [17] . When these pulses collide they generate new frequencies [18] , which are shifted towards higher energies [19] . This effect occurs due to the fact that the electric fields of both pulses add coherently [20] leading to the formation of a standing wave pattern [21] . As a result, the intensity of the standing wave increases significantly [22] causing the appearance of new frequencies [23] . \n \n Here we report on the first experimental observation of the relativistic tennis effect [24] . To achieve this goal, we used a relativistically flying mirror [25] , which",
    "We study the gravitational field generated by a massive scalar point source moving on an equatorial circular geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole, and we evolve it numerically in two spatial dimensions (2+1) with the puncture method. We find that the perturbation is dominated by a single mode which grows exponentially as time goes on. The growth rate agrees well with the prediction based on quasinormal modes for this system. This result suggests that the exponential growth may be related to the instability of the scalar field near the horizon. In addition, we also show that the amplitude of the growing mode decreases rapidly when the mass of the scalar field increases. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. \n \n Introduction \n \n Black holes are among the most fascinating objects predicted by general relativity. They have been studied extensively both theoretically and observationally over many decades [1] . One important aspect of their physics concerns how particles move close to them [2] , especially those that can escape from the black hole's gravity [3] . It has recently become clear that there exist some interesting physical processes taking place very close to the event horizon [4] - [6] . For example, if one considers a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, then its motion will be unstable due to the so-called \"photon sphere effect\" [7, 8] . If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, then the particle will eventually fall into the black hole after emitting photons [9] . Another interesting phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole [10] . Here again, the motion becomes unstable because of the existence of the photon sphere [11] . However, unlike the case of a Reissner-Norström black hole, the emitted radiation now contains not only photons but also gravitons [12] . \n \n In recent years, much attention has been paid to studying the dynamics of fields outside black holes [13] - [17] . In particular, the problem of finding the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), i.e., the characteristic frequencies at",
    "We study the effect of measurement noise on the Markov property for stochastic processes with continuous state spaces and discrete time steps. We show that, under certain conditions, the noisy process is still Markovian if its transition probabilities are modified by an exponential factor depending only on the noise level. This result can be used to derive efficient algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of such processes. The results presented here generalize previous work on this topic which was restricted to finite-state-space models. In addition we provide examples illustrating how our theory applies to several important classes of stochastic processes including diffusion processes, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes, and hidden Markov models. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe main goal of this article is to present some new theoretical results about the effects of measurement noise on the statistical behavior of stochastic processes. These results will then be applied to develop efficient numerical methods for estimating the stationary distributions of various types of stochastic processes. Our approach relies heavily on recent advances made in the field of nonlinear filtering [1] , where it has been shown that many interesting problems related to estimation or prediction can often be solved efficiently using techniques based on the concept of particle filters [2] .",
    "The influence of pulsed magnetic fields on the relaxation processes in HTSC was investigated by measuring the temperature dependence of resistance and Hall coefficient for samples with different oxygen content (d = 0, 1). The results show that the application of pulsed magnetic fields leads to an increase in the resistivity and Hall mobility of the sample with d = 0. This effect is explained as due to the appearance of additional scattering centers caused by defects formed during the process of magnetization reversal. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the case of the sample with d=1. It can be assumed that this difference is associated with the presence of structural disordering in the crystal lattice of the latter compound. \n \n Keywords: High-Tc Superconductor, Pulsed Magnetic Field, Relaxation Processes, Defects Formation, Magnetoresistance, Hall Effect. Introduction \n \n Investigation of relaxation phenomena in high temperature superconductors under the action of pulsed external magnetic fields has been attracting considerable attention recently [1]-[5] . These studies are important both for understanding the physics of these materials and for practical applications [6] - [8] . \n \n In particular, it should be noted that the investigation of relaxation processes in HTSCs allows one to study the dynamics of defect formation [9] , which plays an important role in determining their transport properties [10] . At present there are several models describing the mechanism of defect generation [11] - [13] . However, none of them takes into account the possibility of defect formation induced by the action of pulsed fields [14] . \nExperimental details\n\nIn our work we used single crystals of two compounds with different oxygen content: HoBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (HBS) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+δ (YBS), grown using the floating zone method [15] . The oxygen concentration in the samples was determined by iodometric titration [16] . The typical size of the samples was about 5 × 4 mm 2 . The measurements were carried out in liquid helium cryostats equipped with pulse magnets [17] . The maximum value of the magnetic induction reached up to B max =",
    "We present an analysis of the most massive cluster known to be part of the Great Attractor, based on new spectroscopic data obtained with VLT/VIMOS and archival Chandra X-ray Observatory observations. The main results are as follows:  We find that the galaxy distribution is well described by a single NFW profile out to at least 1 Mpc/h.  Using this mass model we derive a virial mass for the cluster of Mvir = 2.1 x 1015M⊙/h70 within R200 = 0.9 h-1 70 Mpc/h. This value agrees very well with previous estimates derived using different techniques. We also show that the velocity dispersion profile can be fitted with a simple β-model up to r ~ 0.7R200. Beyond this radius there seems to be evidence for a steepening of the profile which could indicate the presence of substructures or infalling groups along the line-of-sight.",
    "The geometry of time is the study of how space-time evolves in time.  The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time [1] . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski [2] who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",
    "We consider universal quantization for distributed estimation over noisy channels, where feedback is available at both ends and communication rates are constrained by an average power constraint. We propose a novel scheme that achieves the optimal rate-distortion tradeoff under this setting. The proposed scheme consists of two parts: (i) A quantizer design based on the Lloyd-Max algorithm; (ii) An encoding-decoding strategy using successive refinement coding to achieve the desired distortion level while satisfying the average power constraints. Our results show that the proposed scheme can be implemented efficiently even when the number of sensors grows large. In addition, we provide numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings. Finally, we discuss some possible extensions of our work.

    "In this work, we propose a novel cross-layer scheme to improve the performance of distributed wireless ad hoc networks (DWAHNs). The proposed scheme is based on an adaptive routing protocol and a dynamic channel allocation algorithm. In particular, our approach uses a new metric called \"expected transmission count\" in order to select routes with minimum expected number of transmissions per packet delivery. Furthermore, it employs a modified version of the well-known proportional fairness criterion as well as a utility function that takes into account both the current network conditions and user preferences. Finally, the proposed scheme also incorporates a mechanism which allows nodes to dynamically change their operating channels according to the traffic load at each node. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted using NS-2 simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under different scenarios. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches by achieving higher throughput while maintaining low end-to-end delay and packet loss rate.",
    "Epitaxial thin films of the multiferroic compound Bi2FeCrO 6 were grown on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition at 750 °C in an oxygen partial pressure of 0.1 mbar and annealed for 30 min under vacuum conditions to induce ferroelectricity.  The structural properties of these epitaxial films are investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe techniques as well as Raman spectroscopy. It is found that the films grow coherently strained along [001] direction with a tetragonal structure. A strong in-plane anisotropy between the out-of-plane lattice parameters c and a was observed which can be explained by different ionic radii of Fe 3+ , Cr 3+ and Ti 4+ . In addition, it could be shown that the films exhibit a rhombohedral-like distortion due to the presence of antiphase boundaries.",
    "We study the geometry of harmonic maps into spheres with values in vector bundles over Riemann surfaces. We prove that if such a map is not constant then it has no critical points outside its singular set (Theorem 1). This implies that any harmonic section of an oriented rank 2 bundle over a closed surface can be deformed to a smooth one without changing its homotopy class (Corollary 3).\nIn particular we show how this result leads to new proofs for some results about instantons on 4-dimensional manifolds due to Donaldson [D1] , [D2] . In fact our proof gives more information than those given by Donaldson's arguments since it allows us to control the behavior of the harmonic section near its singularities. Finally we give examples showing that these results are sharp. The main theorem of this article states that every non-constant harmonic section of an oriented 2-plane bundle over a closed surface S can be deformed to another harmonic section which is smooth everywhere except at isolated points where it has only simple poles.",
    "We present new observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA of polarized emission from the nearby (7 Mpc) grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 6946. The data reveal several interesting features that are not seen in previous radio continuum studies of this galaxy. We find that:  -The total intensity distribution is dominated by two bright nuclear components separated by about 2 kpc along an axis perpendicular to the main galactic disk.  -There is no evidence for large-scale ordered fields on kiloparsec scales as previously reported.   -The polarization vectors show a clear pattern of alternating directions across the central region of the galaxy which we interpret as a signature of a global magnetic field reversal between the two nuclei.  -The rotation measure map shows a ring-like structure around each nucleus where the RM changes sign indicating a change in direction of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field. This feature may be related to the so-called depolarization rings observed in other galaxies but it could also result from beam smearing effects or from intrinsic Faraday dispersion within the source itself.  -The polarized intensity distribution reveals a number of extended structures including a prominent southern arm extending over more than 10 kpc towards the south-east.",
    "We report on the valley dependent optoelectronic properties in monolayer WSe2, which is an inversion symmetry breaking semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling and large exciton binding energy. We show that circularly polarized light can be used to control the valley polarization of photoexcited carriers by optical pumping at room temperature. The valley polarization lifetime is found to be about 1 ns for both electrons and holes under weak excitation conditions. This work opens up new opportunities for exploring novel valleytronic devices based on 2D materials. \n \n Valleytronics has been proposed as one promising approach towards realizing spin-based electronics beyond conventional silicon technology1-5 . Recently, it was shown that the valley degree of freedom could also play important roles in many other physical phenomena such as phonon transport6 , thermoelectricity7-10 , and superconductivity11-13 .\n \n \n Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are emerging two-dimensional semiconductors14-17 with broken inversion symmetry18-20 due to their unique layered structure21-23 .

    "The dynamics-based approach is an emerging method for studying terrestrial exoplanets, which are planets with masses similar to that of Earth orbiting other stars in the solar system.  The main goal of this research is to study how these planets form and evolve over time.   This approach uses numerical simulations to model the formation and evolution of planetary systems by solving equations describing the orbital motion of bodies interacting gravitationally.   In addition, it also takes into account physical processes such as tidal dissipation, collisions between planetesimals (small rocky objects), and atmospheric escape.    By using this approach we can better understand how our own planet formed billions of years ago and what conditions were necessary for life on Earth to develop. Keywords: Planetary Science; Astrobiology; Tidal Dissipation; Collisions Between Planetesimals; Atmospheric Escape. Introduction:  The dynamics-based approach is an emergent method for studying terrestrial extrasolar planets, or planets with masses similar to Earth's orbiting other stars within the Solar System.  These types of planets have been discovered recently through space missions like Kepler and K2.  The main goal of the dynamics-based approach is to study how these worlds form and evolve over time.  It does so by modeling the formation and evolution of the entire planetary system numerically via solving equations describing the orbital motions of bodies interacting gravitationally.  Additionally, it incorporates physical processes including tidal dissipation, collisions among planetesimals (smaller rocky objects) and atmospheric escape.  By applying this approach, scientists hope to gain insight about how our own planet formed billion(s) of years ago and what environmental factors may be required for life to exist there.",
    "We study the floating phase in the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI). We find that there is no floating phase for J1 = J2, but it appears when J1 > J2 and disappears at some critical value of J1/J2. The transition between the ordered state and the floating phase belongs to the universality class of the three-state Potts model with first-order transition. In addition we show that the ground states are degenerate on the square lattice if J1 = J2 or J1 < J2. This result suggests that the ground states may be non-degenerate even though they have not been found yet. \n \n Introduction \n \n It has been known since the work by Wannier [1] that the ground states of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an infinite square lattice are infinitely degenerate. However, this fact does not necessarily mean that all possible configurations can appear as ground states [2] . For example, the ground states of the one-dimensional chain are unique although its energy spectrum is continuous [3] , while those of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate [4] . \n \n Recently, several authors studied the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest neighbor Ising model (AN-NNI) [5 - 7] . They showed numerically that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on the square lattices if J 1 = J 2 or J 1 < J 2 [7 ] . On the other hand, the ground states were shown to be unique on the honeycomb lattice [8] . These results suggest that the ground states might be nondegenerate even though their exact forms remain unknown so far. \n \n In this Letter, we investigate the ground states of the ANNNI model using Monte Carlo simulations. First, we confirm that the ground states are indeed infinitely degenerate on the squarelattice ANNNI models. Then, we examine whether these ground states are unique or not. Finally, we discuss how the ground states change depending on the values of J 1 / J 2 .\n \n Ground States of the Square-Lattice",
    "We present optical variability measurements for infrared power law-selected galaxies and X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). We use data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys to measure photometric redshifts, rest-frame absolute magnitudes, stellar masses, star formation rates, and specific star-formation rates for these objects over an eight-year baseline. The sample consists of 16,000 galaxies at 0 < z < 5 selected by their mid-infrared colors using Spitzer/IRAC observations as well as 1,500 X-ray point sources detected in deep Chandra observations. We find that both galaxy samples show significant levels of intrinsic variation on timescales ranging from days to years. For example, we detect more than 50% of our IRAC-selected galaxies at 3.6 microns and 80% at 4.5 microns showing >0.1 mag variations between epochs separated by one year or less. These results are consistent with previous studies which have found similar levels of variability among optically-selected quasars. However, we also find evidence suggesting that this level of variability is not driven solely by AGN activity but may be associated with other physical processes such as mergers and/or interactions within the host galaxy itself.",
    "We study the stability properties of longitudinal flows in straight and curved magnetic flux tubes using linearized ideal MHD equations. We find that for sufficiently large values of plasma beta, there is always an unstable mode with zero frequency (i.e., static) which grows exponentially fast at small wavenumbers. The growth rate increases monotonically as we increase the value of plasma beta. \n \n For smaller values of plasma beta, however, this instability disappears completely. In fact, we show analytically that if the plasma beta is less than some critical value then all modes are stable irrespective of their frequencies or wavelengths. This result agrees well with our numerical simulations. Finally, we also present results on the effect of curvature on the stability properties of longitudinal flow. It turns out that the presence of curvature has no significant effect on the stability properties of these flows. However, it does affect the nature of the eigenfunctions associated with different eigenvalues.",
    "We present the results of our second survey to find very low mass binaries using lucky imaging with the Palomar Observatory 1.2 m telescope and the PALM-3000 camera. We have discovered thirteen new systems, including ten brown dwarf companions (four previously unknown) in twelve nearby young open clusters ranging in age between 10 Myr and 300 Myr. The masses range from 0.03-0.10 M . These are among the lowest-mass objects ever found by direct imaging techniques. In addition we report on one system that is likely an unresolved binary consisting of two late-type stars. This work represents the largest sample of directly imaged brown dwarfs assembled so far. It will be used as input into population synthesis models aimed at understanding how these objects form and evolve over time. \n \n Keywords: Brown Dwarf, Open Cluster, Direct Imaging, Lucky Imaging, Nearby Stars",
    "We present the results of our numerical simulations of accretion disk annuli in which radiation pressure is comparable to gas pressure, but not dominant.  We find that for such disks there are two distinct regimes depending on whether or not the luminosity is dominated by advection (i.e., Ladv/Lvisc ≫ 1). In one regime we find that the temperature profile has a power-law form T ∝ r^{-(3/2)}, while in another it follows a more complicated dependence on radius. The latter case occurs when the luminosity is dominated either by viscous dissipation or by advection. For both cases, however, the radial velocity profiles have similar shapes. Finally, we show how these results can be used to explain observed properties of X-ray binaries. Subject headings: Black holes -accretion disks -X-ray binaries: general -Accretion, accretion disks",
    "The book Nurturing Breakthroughs by James Watson and Peter Winkler is about how to create breakthroughs in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM). The authors argue that the best way for scientists to make new discoveries is not through individual genius but rather by working together as teams on problems they are passionate about.  They also claim that it helps if you have an idea of what your problem looks like before you start solving it because this will help guide your research efforts. This article describes some of their ideas and provides examples of how these concepts can be applied to physics research. In his book Nurturing Breakdowns, James Watson argues that the most successful people who solve complex problems do so by working with others instead of trying to work alone. He says that when we work individually our brains tend to focus only on one aspect of the problem at hand which may lead us down dead ends while working collaboratively allows us to see all aspects of the problem simultaneously.",
    "We propose to probe the nature of dark energy by correlating the morphological properties of galaxies in the nearby universe (z < 0.1) as measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with those at higher redshifts, z ~ 1, obtained from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use steerable wavelet transforms on galaxy images to obtain morphological parameters such as concentration index, asymmetry index, Gini coefficient etc., which are then correlated with their counterparts derived from WMAP data using the same technique. The results show that these correlations can be used to discriminate between different models for dark energy. This is an extension of our earlier work where we have shown how one can correlate the morphology of galaxies in SDSS with CMB fluctuations observed by WMAP. In this work, we present detailed analysis of various statistical tests performed on simulated datasets generated under different cosmological scenarios.",
    "The objective was to evaluate the potential use of Monoksa dorsiplana as an alternative biological control agent against Pseudopachymeria sp. (Bruchidae). The parasitoids were obtained in laboratory and released on P.sp. eggs laid by females collected at different locations in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. Egg parasitism ranged between 0.5 and 88% depending on location. Parasitized eggs hatched after 7 days under controlled conditions. Males emerged first followed by females. Female longevity varied according to temperature ranging from 11 to 21 days at 25 °C; 14 to 23 days at 20 °C and 16 to 27 days at 15 °C. Females oviposited for up to three weeks when fed with honey solution. This species is considered highly suitable for mass production because it has high reproductive capacity and short life cycle.

    "We present an overview on supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY-GUT), their connection to neutrino masses via seesaw mechanisms as well as dark matter candidates in these models. We discuss how GUT scale physics can be probed at future colliders such as LHC or ILC. Finally we give some examples for specific realizations within SO(10) and E6 gauge groups. Supersymmetry is one of the most promising extensions beyond the Standard Model which addresses many open questions like the hierarchy problem between electroweak and Planck scales, unification of forces etc.. In addition it provides a natural candidate for cold dark matter -the lightest neutralino. The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) has been studied extensively over the last two decades but suffers from several shortcomings. One of them is that the MSSM does not provide any explanation why there are three generations of quarks and leptons with different quantum numbers. Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) address this issue by postulating that all known particles including those of the third generation belong to multiplets of larger symmetry group than SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). This leads naturally to relations among coupling constants and fermion mass matrices. Another shortcoming of the MSSM is that it cannot explain small neutrino masses observed experimentally. However, if R-parity is broken then Majorana neutrinos may acquire tiny masses through see-saw mechanism. These new states could also contribute significantly to the relic density of dark matter.",
    "The effect of silver and indium on the magnetic properties, electrical resistivity (ER) and Hall coefficient (R H ) has been investigated in La 2/3 Ca 1/3 Mn O 3 . The results show that ER decreases with increasing temperature for all samples while R H increases with decreasing temperature. It is found that both silver and indium doping decrease T C , increase J c and enhance pinning force density F p . Silver doped sample shows higher values of J c than indium doped one at low temperatures but lower value at high temperatures.  These results are explained by considering different effects of silver and indium ions on the microstructure as well as their influence on oxygen vacancies concentration. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 50571040. We would like to thank Prof. Y. M. Wu for his help during this research. Abstract: In this study we have prepared two series of La 2/3 Ca 1/3 MnO 3 :Ag and La 2/3 Ca 1/3 MnO3 :In polycrystalline composite materials using solid state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction patterns confirm single phase formation without any impurity peaks. The structural parameters such as lattice constant, unit cell volume and bond length were calculated from XRD data. The dc magnetization measurements reveal that Curie temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and pinning force density (Fp) decrease with increasing amount of silver or indium content.",
    "We study the properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with an arbitrary number N of particles trapped by a harmonic oscillator and exposed to a disordered external potential. We show that, for any strength of disorder, there is always a finite fraction of atoms localized at each site of the lattice. The localization length decreases as the disorder increases but remains macroscopic even when the disorder becomes very large compared to the interatomic interaction energy. This result holds true both in one dimension and higher dimensions.  In particular we find that the critical disorder above which all states are localized scales like 1/N in 1D and 1/d in 2D and 3D where d is the spatial dimension. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of recent experiments on ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Introduction:-Recent experimental advances have made it possible to create quantum degenerate gases of bosons or fermions confined in periodic potentials [1] . These systems can be described theoretically using the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model [2] , which has been extensively studied over the past decade [3] .\nIn this work we consider the case of a gas of interacting bosons in a disordered potential. Disorder leads to Anderson localization [4] : eigenstates become exponentially localized around their initial position if the disorder exceeds some threshold value [5] . It was recently shown experimentally [6] that such a system exhibits a transition between extended Bloch-like states and localized Wannier-Stark ladders [7, 8] . However, these experiments were performed only in the weak-disorder regime, i.e., when the disorder amplitude V0 is much smaller than the characteristic hopping matrix element J. Here we investigate how the presence of interactions affects the physics of strongly disordered systems.",
    "We study the statistical properties of surface fluctuations for different values of the lateral size L and height H of the system, using numerical simulations on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions. We find that the probability density function (PDF) of the local slope angle θ is well described by an exponential decay at large angles, while it displays power-law tails at small slopes. The crossover between these two regimes occurs around θ = 0.5π. In addition to this behavior, we observe that the PDFs are strongly dependent upon both L and H. This dependence can be explained as finite-size effects: when L or H becomes smaller than some characteristic length scale, the PDFs become broader due to the presence of more rare events. Finally, we show how our results compare favorably with experimental data obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy measurements performed on Si(111). PACS numbers: 68.35.Bs",

    "We present results on interface widths in liquid-gas systems, obtained by molecular dynamics simulations with different potentials. We find that the potential should be able to reproduce both bulk properties (e.g., density) as well as surface tension at coexistence conditions simultaneously. The latter requirement is not fulfilled by standard Lennard-Jones or hard-sphere models. In order to overcome this problem we propose an alternative model which reproduces all relevant physical quantities within their experimental uncertainty. This new model can also be used to study other phenomena like capillary waves. \n \n Introduction \n \n Interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and play important roles in many processes ranging from phase separation [1] over wetting [2] to crystal growth [3] . They have been studied extensively using computer simulations [4] , but it has proven difficult to obtain reliable data due to finite size effects [5] . These arise because interfaces are typically only one particle thick [6] so that they cannot be simulated directly. Instead, periodic boundary conditions must be applied [7, 8] leading to artificial interactions between images of the same interface [9] . As a result, the measured interfacial width depends strongly on system size [10] .\n \nIn recent years there has been considerable progress towards understanding these finite-size effects [11] . It was shown that the dependence of the interfacial width w on the linear dimension L of the system follows a power law [12] :",
    "The discovery of the first X-ray pulsar, Scorpius X1 (Sco-X1), by Giacconi et al. (1962) opened up an exciting new field for astrophysics and led to the development of many important concepts such as accretion disks around compact objects.  The study of these systems has been revolutionized with the launch of Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories which have allowed us to probe their physical properties on unprecedented spatial scales.   In this review we will discuss some recent results obtained using these satellites that shed light on how neutron stars are formed and evolve within low-mass binary systems. We will also present our current understanding of the physics behind the formation of relativistic jets observed in several classes of X-ray binaries. Finally, we will briefly describe the prospects offered by future missions like XEUS or Constellation-X for studying these fascinating sources.

    "We have performed first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of phonon transmission across an epitaxial interface between Si and Ge, which are important for thermoelectric applications. We found that the phonon transmission is strongly suppressed at low frequencies due to the mismatch in acoustic impedance between two materials. The suppression becomes more significant as the thickness of Ge layer decreases. In addition, we observed that the phonon transmission exhibits strong anisotropy with respect to incident angle. These results suggest that it may be possible to control thermal transport by tuning the structure of epitaxial interfaces. Epitaxial interfaces play crucial roles in determining physical properties such as electrical conductivity [1] , optical reflectivity [2] , mechanical strength [3] , and thermal conductivity [4] . For example, recent studies on superlattices show that the thermal conductance can be reduced significantly compared to bulk values [5, 6] .\nIn this work, we focus on phonons because they dominate heat conduction in solids [7, 8] . Phonon scattering at epitaxial interfaces has been studied extensively using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [9] or kinetic theory [10] . However, these approaches cannot provide detailed information about phonon transmission across interfaces since they do not take into account atomic interactions explicitly [11] . On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT), which describes electronic states based on quantum mechanics [12] , allows us to calculate phonon transmission coefficients directly [13] . Therefore, DFT-based methods are suitable for investigating phonon transmission across epi-",
    "We present an exact expression for the pressure tensor of a fluid confined by any external potential, which is valid at all temperatures. The result can be obtained as a special case of the virial expansion for the grand canonical partition function. We show that this expression reduces to known results when applied to specific potentials such as harmonic traps or periodic lattices. Finally we apply our general formula to calculate the equation of state of a gas of fermions with attractive interactions in two dimensions. In particular, we find that the system undergoes a phase transition into a superfluid state below some critical temperature Tc. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747 (M.A.) . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe thermodynamic properties of many-body systems are often studied using statistical mechanics methods [1] , where one considers ensembles of particles interacting via a given potential energy V(r). For example, if the particles interact through short-range forces only, then it is possible to derive expressions for various physical quantities like density profiles [2] , compressibility [3] , heat capacity [4] , etc., starting from the microscopic definition of entropy S = -k B ln Z, where k B is Boltzmann's constant and Z is the partition function defined as:",
    "We study the dependence of galaxy isophotal structure parameters, such as the Sersic index n, effective radius Re, axis ratio q, position angle PA, and surface brightness SB, on environment (local density) and nuclear activity (AGN luminosity). We use a sample of early-type galaxies selected by their colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6), which contains about 1 million objects with spectroscopic redshifts between 0 < z < 0.3. The local density around each galaxy was estimated using its nearest neighbors within a projected distance rp = 20h-1 Mpc and a velocity difference |v| = 1000 km s-1. For our analysis we used only those galaxies that have no nearby companions brighter than them by more than one magnitude to avoid any possible contamination due to tidal interactions or mergers. \n \n In order to investigate how these structural properties depend on environment and nuclear activity, we divided our sample into four different subsamples based on the values of local density and AGN luminosity: low-density/low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), high-density/high-luminosity active Galactic Nuclei (HLAGNs), low-density/high-luminous inactive galaxies (LHIGGs), and high-density/low-luminous inactive galaxies(HLIGGs). \n \n Our results show that LLAGNs are generally rounder and less concentrated compared to HLAGNs. This suggests that LLAGNs may be undergoing morphological transformations driven by environmental effects and/or internal processes associated with black hole growth. On average, LHIGGs appear to be rounder but slightly less concentrated than HLIGGs. However, there appears to be an overlap among all four samples for most of the structural parameters considered here.",
    "We present parallax measurements for four short-period (P orb < 80 min) AM CVn stars using the Fine Guidance Sensor on board HST, which are accurate to better than 1% in distance. We find that all systems have distances consistent with their being located within 20 pc of Earth. The derived absolute magnitudes range between MV = 12.5 and 14.1 mag, corresponding to luminosities of 1030 - 1600 L⊙ . These values are significantly brighter than those predicted by theoretical models of these objects, indicating either an underestimate of the mass transfer rates or an overestimate of the white dwarf masses. In addition we use our new parallaxes together with previously published data to derive improved estimates of the orbital periods and component masses for three of the targets studied here. Finally, we discuss how our results can be used to test current evolutionary scenarios for this class of binary system.",
    "We introduce the concept of generalized conditional random fields (GCRFs) and show how they can be used to model arbitrary probability distributions over structured data sets, such as sequences or trees.  We present an efficient algorithm for learning GCRF parameters using gradient descent on the log-likelihood objective function.   Finally we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn accurate models for several challenging sequence labeling tasks including part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing and protein secondary structure prediction in bioinformatics. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001 ) are undirected graphical models which have been successfully applied to many problems involving sequential data, e.g. (Sha & Pereira, 2003) . In this work, we propose Generalized Conditional Random Fields (GCRFs), a generalization of CRFs which allows us to represent any distribution over structured data sets like sequences or trees. The key idea behind GCRFs is to use a set of latent variables to capture dependencies between different parts of the input space. This enables us to efficiently compute the partition function required by standard CRFs with dynamic programming techniques. Furthermore, it also makes it possible to train GCRFs using gradient-based methods similar to those employed for Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs). To evaluate the performance of our method, we apply it to two important applications: part-of-speech taggin",
    "We present new radial velocity measurements for the short-period binary system WZ Sge, which show that its orbital period is decreasing at an average rate of  _ P = -1.3 x 10^(-7) d/s.  We use these data to derive dynamical mass estimates for both components and find M_1 = 0.85 ± 0.05M_sun and M_2 = 0.65 ± 0.04M_sun. The primary star has evolved off the main sequence but still retains some hydrogen in its atmosphere; it is therefore classified as a subdwarf B (sdB). Our results are consistent with previous determinations based on photometric observations. However, our analysis provides more accurate values because we have used higher quality spectroscopic data than were available previously. In addition, we have been able to determine the individual masses rather than just their ratio. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-13523.",
    "The intramolecular structure of polymers is studied by means of the molecular dynamics simulation method for several model systems with different chain lengths, degrees of branching, and types of interactions between monomers. It has been found that the intramolecular correlation function can be represented as a sum of two terms corresponding to short- and long-range contributions. The latter term describes the contribution of segments separated by distances larger than the average distance between neighboring chains. This term depends on the number density of chains and their length. In addition, it was shown that this term decreases exponentially at large separations. The dependence of the first four moments of the segmental size distribution on temperature and pressure are calculated using the results obtained previously. These dependences were compared with experimental data available in literature. Good agreement between theory and experiment is observed. \n \n Keywords: Polymer melt, Intramolecular structure, Correlation functions, Segmental size distribution",
    "We present new results on the nature and geometry of the compact object in the gamma-ray binary system LS I +61 303, based on observations with the INTEGRAL satellite. We find that the source is variable at all wavelengths studied here (radio to hard X-rays), but shows no evidence for orbital modulation or eclipses. The X-ray spectrum can be described by either a power law model or thermal bremsstrahlung emission; both are consistent with previous studies. In addition we report the detection of pulsations in the radio band which have been previously reported only once before. These pulsations show up as periodic intensity variations in our data set, and their periodicity has been confirmed using two independent methods. Using these results together with those obtained from optical photometry and spectroscopy, we conclude that this source most likely contains a neutron star accreting matter from its companion Be-star via Roche lobe overflow.",
    "We study the dynamics of an open system, which is composed by a two-level atom interacting with a single-mode cavity field and driven by a classical laser source. We show that this simple model can be used to describe the behavior of a quantum information processor (QIP) based on trapped ions or atoms coupled to optical cavities. In particular we find signatures of decoherence in QIPs due to spontaneous emission noise. The results are obtained using exact numerical solutions for the master equation describing our model. Quantum information processing has been proposed as one possible application of quantum mechanics [1] . A number of experimental realizations have already been achieved [2] , but it remains unclear how practical these devices will become [3] .\nIn order to understand better what kind of problems may arise when implementing such schemes experimentally, it would be useful to develop models that allow us to investigate the effects of different types of errors [4] . Here we consider a very simple model consisting of a two-level atom interacting resonantly with a single mode of an electromagnetic field inside a cavity [5] . This system could represent either a trapped ion [6] or an atom coupled to an optical cavity [7, 8] . It is well known that if there were no losses present then the state of the system at any time t > 0 would simply be given by |ψ(t) = e −iωat/2 cos[ω c t + θ(0)]/ √ 2 where ω a and ω c are respectively the atomic and cavity frequencies [9] . However, in practice both the atom-cavity coupling strength g and the decay rate κ associated with the cavity field are finite so that the evolution of the system becomes more complicated [10] .",
    "We study the unitarity properties of an effective field theory describing the interactions between gluons and quarks in QCD at high energies, where perturbation theory is not applicable anymore. The model we consider consists of a gauge-invariant action containing both massive and massless fields. We show that this model can be written as a sum over Feynman diagrams which are all unitary individually if certain conditions on the parameters appearing in the Lagrangian density are satisfied. In particular, it turns out that the masses of the particles involved must satisfy some relations to ensure unitarity. Finally, we discuss how these results could be used for phenomenological applications. PACS numbers: 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Qk, 13 .60.Hb \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K S\nThe Standard Model (SM) describes successfully most experimental data available today [1] , but its validity has been tested only up to energies of about 1 TeV [2] . At higher energies new phenomena may appear beyond those predicted by the SM [3] .\nIn order to describe such effects one usually considers extensions of the SM [4] or models based on effective theories [5] . Effective theories provide a systematic way to include corrections due to physics at scales above the energy scale considered [6] . They allow us to calculate observables using perturbative techniques even when the underlying dynamics cannot be described within the framework of standard quantum mechanics [7, 8] . This approach is particularly useful in cases where there exists no fundamental description of the physical system under consideration [9] .\nOne example of an effective theory is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions [10] . It predicts the existence of hadrons made of quarks and gluons [11] . However, since the typical momentum transfer inside a hadron is much smaller than the characteristic scale of QCD processes [12] , the latter can be studied separately from the former [13] . For instance, the production of jets [14] and heavy flavors [15] in high-energy collisions can be calculated using perturbative methods [16] . On the other hand, the interaction among partons [17]",
    "We present an exact expression for the pair correlation functions in terms of a free energy functional, valid both above and below the nematic transition temperature T_N. The functional is obtained by minimizing the grand potential with respect to all possible orientations of the director field n(r). We show that this approach leads to results which are consistent with those obtained using Onsager's theory at high temperatures (T_T>T_N), but also provides new insight into the structure of the nematic phase near its critical point. In particular we find that the orientational order parameter S exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as a function of density, while the positional correlations remain short ranged throughout the entire range of densities studied here. Finally, our analysis shows that the nematic phase can be viewed as a superposition of two different liquid phases characterized by distinct values of the orientational order parameter.

    "We study the dynamics of three agent games with two strategies each, where agents are connected by an underlying network and play pairwise interactions according to their strategy choices. We show that for any initial state there is always at least one absorbing state in which all agents have the same strategy choice. In addition we find that if the number of nodes with either strategy exceeds 1 then this state can be reached within finite time. Finally, we provide bounds on how fast such convergence occurs as well as conditions under which it will occur exponentially quickly. The results presented here generalize previous work done on two-agent evolutionary games to multi-agent systems. Evolutionary game theory has been used extensively over the past decade to model competition between different species or individuals competing for limited resources [1] . A common approach taken when modeling these types of problems is to consider a population consisting of many interacting agents who choose among several possible strategies [2] , and then use mathematical tools developed in statistical physics [3] to analyze the resulting system behavior [4] .\nIn recent years researchers have begun studying more complex models involving multiple populations [5] , spatial structure [6] , and heterogeneous environments [7, 8] . However, most existing research focuses only on two-player games [9] , while less attention has been paid to multi-agent systems [10] . Here we present new results showing that even simple multi-agent systems exhibit richer dynamical behaviors than previously thought [11] .",
    "We present an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of Feynman diagrams with arbitrary numbers of external particles and internal loops, which is based on the concept of \"partonic subdiagrams\". The method allows to perform calculations in QCD beyond leading order accuracy without any approximations or assumptions about the kinematics of the process under consideration. We demonstrate its applicability by calculating the next-to-leading-order corrections to the production cross section of heavy quarks at hadron colliders. In this talk we will discuss how one can gain analytic control over parton showers using the concept of \"partons\" as fundamental degrees of freedom. This approach has been developed recently within the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) [1] . It provides a systematic way to resum large logarithms associated with collinear splittings into multiple jets [2] , thereby improving our understanding of jet physics [3] .\nThe basic idea behind SCET is that physical observables are described by matrix elements involving soft and/or collinear fields only [4] . These fields have nontrivial transformation properties under boosts along the beam axis [5] . They allow us to separate hard interactions from soft radiation [6] . As a result, it becomes possible to systematically factorize contributions to scattering amplitudes into \"hard functions\" describing short-distance dynamics [7, 8] and \"semi-hard functions\" encoding information about the emission of soft gluons [9] .",
    "We present an alternative method to the usual Feynman path integral description for calculating the probability amplitudes in quantum walk models, based on the concept of scattering states and their associated S-matrix elements. We show that this new formalism allows us to obtain exact results for several interesting cases where standard methods fail or are not applicable. In particular we consider two different types of boundary conditions at one end of the chain (the origin) which lead to completely different behaviour of the system as time evolves. The first type is known as Dirichlet boundary condition, corresponding to reflecting particles back into the origin after they have left it once; while the second case corresponds to absorbing particles when they reach the origin. For both these cases we calculate exactly the evolution operator over all times t > 0 using our new method. Finally, by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the evolution operator we can recover the full probability distribution function of finding the walker at any position x along the chain at time t.",
    "We present the results for the equation of state (EoS) in hot Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We use two different approaches to solve numerically the lattice QCD EoS at finite temperature, namely the Taylor expansion method and the integral method. The latter is based on an exact representation of the pressure as a function of energy density using Padé approximants. In addition we also study the dependence of the EoS on the number of flavors Nf . Finally, we compare our numerical results with those obtained by other authors within various theoretical frameworks. Our main conclusions are that both methods give consistent results which agree well with previous calculations performed in the literature. Moreover, it turns out that the inclusion of strange quarks has only minor effects on the thermodynamic quantities considered here. \n \n Keywords: Equation of State; Heavy Ion Collisions; Lattice QCD; Relativistic Hydrodynamics",

    "We present an extension of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism to describe non-Markovian processes in terms of a stochastic Liouville equation with memory kernel. The latter is obtained by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution function, which can be done analytically only under certain conditions on the form of the memory kernel. We show that this problem can be overcome by introducing a new concept of \"stochastic propagator\", which allows us to obtain exact solutions even when the memory kernel does not have any particular functional dependence on time or space variables. Finally we discuss how our results are related to previous works based on fractional calculus techniques. In recent years there has been growing interest in studying systems whose dynamics cannot be described within the standard framework of Markovian processes [1] . This is mainly due to the fact that many physical phenomena exhibit complex temporal behavior characterized by power law relaxation [2] , aging [3] , intermittency [4] , etc., all of them being typical features of nonMarkovian processes [5] .\nIn order to deal with these problems it was proposed [6] to use the so-called Continuous Time Random Walk (CWTRW) formalism [7, 8] . Within such a description one considers a system evolving continuously in time according to some deterministic laws but interrupted at random times by jumps between different states. These jumps occur as a consequence of interactions with other degrees of freedom, e.g. phonons [9] , electrons [10] , photons [11] , etc.. As shown in Ref. [12] , the CWTRW formalism provides a very general description of non-Markovian dynamics since it includes both discrete state models [13] and fractional diffusion equations [14] as special cases. However, despite its great flexibility, the application of the CWTRW formal-",
    "We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on an optical lattice with random disorder and nearest-neighbor hopping, using exact diagonalization techniques. We find that there is a crossover between two different regimes as we increase the strength of disorder. In one regime (weak disorder), the system shows Anderson localization behavior; while in another regime (strong disorder) it exhibits Bose glass behavior. The transition point depends strongly on the filling fraction of particles per site. For low fillings, this transition occurs at relatively small values of disorder strengths. However, for higher fillings, the transition to the Bose glass phase takes place only when the disorder becomes very strong. This suggests that the presence of interactions can significantly affect the nature of the ground state of the system even if they are weak compared to other energy scales such as the bandwidth or the disorder strength. \n \n Introduction \n \n Disorder plays an important role in determining many properties of condensed matter systems. It has been shown recently that disorder can lead to interesting phenomena like quantum Hall effect [1] , metal-insulator transitions [2] , and superconductivity [3] . One of the most studied models which incorporates both disorder and interaction effects is the so-called Anderson model [4] . In its simplest form, this model describes non-interacting electrons moving through a disordered medium. Although the original formulation was restricted to electronic degrees of freedom, it has also been extended to describe various physical situations involving interacting particles [5] - [8] .\n \nIn recent years, ultracold atoms have emerged as promising candidates for simulating complex quantum mechanical problems [9] - [11] . These experiments provide us with unprecedented control over all relevant parameters of the problem under consideration [12] - [14] . Moreover, these systems allow us to explore new physics beyond what is possible in conventional solid-state materials [15] - [17] . Ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattices offer unique opportunities to investigate the interplay between disorder and interactions [18] - [20] . Recently, several experimental groups [21] - [23] have observed signatures of Anderson localization [24] in cold atom systems by studying the transport properties of the gas across the lattice.",
    "We present an analysis of archival XMM-Newton data for the Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mkr841 (NGC 4151). We find that the soft excess emission is well described by a blackbody component with kT = 0.16 keV and luminosity LBB ~ 1043 erg s-1. The hard X-ray spectrum can be fitted either by a power law or Compton reflection model. In both cases we detect strong relativistic Fe Kα lines at 6.4-6.7 keV which are broadened to FWHM ~ 1000 km/sec. These results suggest that there may exist two distinct regions where the accretion disk interacts with the central supermassive black hole. One region produces the soft excess via thermal reprocessing while another one gives rise to the hard X-ray emission through non-thermal processes such as inverse Compton scattering and/or Compton reflection.",
    "Epitaxial growth is the process by which atoms are deposited on top of an existing crystal structure, forming new layers that grow in registry with each other.  Epitaxy can be used to produce thin films and superlattices for electronic devices.   Graphene epitaxy refers to the deposition of carbon atoms onto a substrate such as silicon carbide (SiC) or gallium nitride (GaN).   The resulting material has many properties similar to those of single-layered graphene but also exhibits some differences due to interactions between the different atomic planes.   ... Graphene epitaxy is the deposition of carbon atoms on a substrate such as SiC or GaN. This results in a material with many properties similar to those found in single layer graphene, but there are also important differences arising from interlayer interactions.

    "We present an extension to the classical lubrication theory that accounts for shear thinning effects on both the fluid viscosity and the friction coefficient, which are assumed to be functions of local pressure only.  The resulting model is applied to study the effect of non-Newtonian rheology on the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) behavior of a circular contact between two elastic solids with different surface roughnesses under pure rolling conditions.  We show that the presence of shear thinning leads to significant changes in the predicted load-carrying capacity as well as the distribution of the normal stress across the contact area compared to those obtained using Newtonian models.  In particular, we find that the maximum value of the dimensionless pressure increases significantly when the fluids exhibit strong shear thinning characteristics.  Moreover, our results indicate that the inclusion of shear thinning effects can lead to substantial reductions in the magnitude of the dimensionless tangential stresses at the centerline of the contact region.  Finally, it should be noted that the proposed theoretical framework may also be used to investigate other important phenomena such as thermal effects or mixed lubrication regimes.",
    "We study the propagation of surface waves in a layered medium with different signs of nonlinear coefficients and show that, under certain conditions, localized solutions exist which are similar to those known as gap solitons in periodic structures. The existence domain for these solutions is determined by solving an eigenvalue problem numerically. We also present results on the stability properties of such solutions against small perturbations. Surface wave localization can be observed experimentally using optical waveguide arrays or photonic crystals. In this work we consider the case when two layers have opposite signs of nonlinearities (e.g., one positive and another negative). This situation occurs naturally if the material parameters change sign across some interface between media. For example, it may happen near the boundary between materials with normal dispersion and anomalous dispersion. \n \n We demonstrate that there exists a class of localized solutions which resemble gap solitons in periodic systems. These solutions appear due to the interplay between linear and nonlinear effects. They exist only within a finite range of frequencies and decay exponentially away from their center point. Their amplitude depends strongly on the ratio of the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves.",

The sample includes six previously known binaries that were not included in DR2 because they are too faint for Gaia to resolve their components. We also present an analysis of the mass distribution of these newly discovered white dwarfs based on their photometric distances. This is the first time such a study has been performed using Gaia data alone. Our results show good agreement between our observed mass function and theoretical predictions.

This has led to renewed interest in studying gravitational backgrounds which admit supersymmetry [1] . One such class of spacetimes is given by the so-called warped product spaces [2] , where the metric takes the form ds2 = e2A(y)(ημνdxμ dxν + dy 2 ),\n(1)\nwhere y denotes the coordinate along the extra dimension, A(y) is called the warp factor and ημν is the Minkowski metric. For example, if we consider the five-dimensional case then this corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum model [3] .\nIn recent years it was shown [4] - [8] that the presence of a nontrivial warp factor leads to new features in the physics associated with fields propagating in the bulk. These include modifications to the standard dispersion relations [9] , spontaneous symmetry breaking [10] , fermion localization [11] , etc.. It turns out [12] that the effects due to the warp factor depend crucially upon its behaviour near the boundary of the extra dimension. If the warp factor vanishes sufficiently rapidly at infinity then all physical observables will be identical to those computed using ordinary flat-space techniques. However, if the warp factor does not vanish fast enough then some novel phenomena occur.",
    "We present dynamical models for the Milky Way halo that include an arbitrary number of spherical shells, each characterized by its own density and velocity dispersion profiles. The model is based on Jeans' theorem applied to the phase-space distribution function (DF) in order to obtain the DF as well as the projected surface mass density along any line-of-sight. We show how this approach can be used to fit observational data such as those obtained from kinematic tracers or gravitational lensing measurements. In particular we apply our method to two different sets of observations: 1) A sample of RR Lyrae stars observed towards the Galactic bulge; 2) Gravitational lensing measurements towards the Bullet Cluster. Our results are compared against previous works using similar techniques but assuming either constant anisotropies across all radii or simple power-law radial dependences. We find that these assumptions lead to significant biases when fitting the data.",
    "We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations and analysis of the young binary system UZ Tau E, which is composed of two T Tauri stars with masses ~0.8 M⊙ separated by 0. ′′ 4. The NIR light curves show periodic variations that are consistent with ellipsoidal modulation due to tidal distortion of each star's photosphere as it orbits its companion. We also find evidence for an additional component to this variability; we interpret these data as indicating that one or both components of the binary undergoes periodic episodes of enhanced mass loss at periastron passage. This interpretation is supported by our detection of excess emission in the K-band spectrum during periods when the photometric flux decreases. Our results suggest that the circumstellar disks around each member of the binary have been truncated by their mutual gravitational interaction. In addition, we detect significant changes in the shape of the Hα line profile over time scales of days to weeks. These changes can be explained if there exists a region of high density gas surrounding the binary orbiting on timescales similar to those observed in the NIR light curve.",
    "We report on four new quasars at redshifts z > 6, found in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). The objects were selected as part of an ongoing survey for high-z quasars using photometric data obtained with CFHT and Spitzer Space Telescope. We present their optical to near-infrared SEDs, which are well fitted by composite quasar templates. Their luminosities range between 1.5 x 10^14 erg s-1 cm-2 and 2.1 x 10^15 erg s-1 cm-2 . These results show that there is still room for discovering very luminous quasars beyond redshift six. They also provide further evidence that supermassive black holes grew rapidly during this early phase of galaxy formation. Four quasars have been discovered at redshifts greater than 6 in the Canada France Hawaii telescope legacy survey (CFHTLS) by combining deep infrared observations taken with the Spitzer space telescope with optical data collected with the Canada France Hawaii telescope.",
    "We present an analysis of the effects that mergers may have on scaling relations between black holes (BHs), galaxies, and other gravitationally bound systems. We use cosmological simulations to study how BH mass is related to galaxy properties in different merger histories. Our results show that mergers can significantly affect these relationships by increasing scatter at fixed luminosity or stellar velocity dispersion. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates. In addition, we find that mergers tend to increase the average BH-to-galaxy mass ratio as well as the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among massive galaxies. These findings are consistent with observations of AGN host galaxies. Finally, our results suggest that the observed correlation between supermassive BH masses and bulge properties could be driven primarily by the fact that both grow during major mergers. Keywords: Galaxy evolution; Supermassive black hole",
    "We present the results of our study on bimodality in galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that there is no significant difference between the fraction of AGNs hosted by red or blue galaxies, but we do see an excess of AGNs with respect to normal galaxies at intermediate colors. This suggests that AGNs are not preferentially found in either red or blue galaxies, as previously thought; instead they appear to be more common among galaxies with intermediate color. The lack of correlation between galaxy color and AGN activity may indicate that AGNs play only a minor role in quenching star formation in massive galaxies. Alternatively, it could suggest that AGNs have different effects depending on their luminosity and/or accretion rate. In addition, we find that the majority of AGNs reside in galaxies with bulges, regardless of whether these galaxies are classified as early-type or late-type systems.",
    "Magnetic separation is an important tool in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics, but it has been limited to macroscopic devices that are not suitable for point-of-care applications. Here we report on continuous magnetophoresis-based blood cell sorting using microfluidics. We demonstrate efficient separation of red blood cells (RBCs) from plasma by applying a magnetic field gradient across a microchannel containing RBCs suspended in buffer solution. The results show that our method can be used as a simple yet effective approach for separating different types of blood cells with high purity and efficiency. This work may have significant implications towards developing portable diagnostic tools based on microscale blood processing technologies. Magnetic separation techniques play an important role in many fields including medicine, biotechnology, environmental science, food industry etc., [1] . However, most existing methods require bulky equipment which makes them unsuitable for use outside laboratory settings [2] .\nRecently there has been growing interest in miniaturizing these systems into lab-on-a-chip platforms [3] , where various functionalities such as sample preparation [4] , chemical analysis [5] , drug delivery [6] , and bioassays [7] could be integrated onto one single chip. In particular, magnetic separators have attracted much attention due to their simplicity, low cost, portability, and compatibility with other microfabricated components [8] . For example, several groups have demonstrated magnetic separation of biological samples inside microchannels [9] - [11] or on planar surfaces [12] - [14] . Despite this progress, however, current approaches still suffer from some limitations. First, they typically rely on batch-wise operation mode [15] , which limits throughput and requires large volumes of input samples [16] . Second, the majority of reported designs only allow for separation between two distinct populations [17] , while more complex mixtures involving multiple species cannot be processed simultaneously [18] . Third, the fabrication process usually involves complicated multi-step procedures [19] , making it difficult to integrate additional functions [20] . Finally, most previous studies were performed under static conditions [21] , which limit the flexibility of device design [22] .",
    "We present Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) observations of the nearby, interacting galaxy pair Mrk 297. The system consists of two galaxies separated by ~3 kpc in projection; one is an elliptical galaxy with a bright nuclear point source, while the other has a Seyfert 2 nucleus surrounded by extended emission lines. We detect several molecular hydrogen transitions including H$_2$ S(0), S(1), S(2), S(3), S(4), S(5), S(6), S(7), S(8), S(9), S(10), S(11), S(12), S(13), S(14), S(15), S(16), S(17), S(18), S(19), S(20).

    "The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope will be launched in June 2008, with an expected launch date of August 7, 2007.  The LAT is designed to detect gamma rays between 20 MeV and 300 GeV over a large field-of-view (2 steradians), making it possible for the first time to study the entire sky at these energies every three hours. This talk will discuss how supernova remnants are likely to appear as sources of high-energy emission when observed by this new instrument. In particular I will focus on:  - How many remnants should we expect to see? - What types of remnants might show up? - What can we learn about particle acceleration mechanisms? - What can we do to prepare for the observations? - Other topics that may come up during discussion.

    "We report on spectropolarimetric observations of the M8+M9 binary star LHS 1070A,B (GJ 436) with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. The two stars are separated by only 0. ′′ 1 and have been known to be magnetically active for many years. We find that both stars show significant circularly polarized emission lines indicative of Zeeman splitting due to their magnetic fields. In addition we detect Stokes V signatures indicating net linear polarization across all observed spectral lines. This is likely caused by scattering processes within the stellar atmosphere. Using our new data set together with previously published photometric measurements we derive rotation periods of P A = 3.6 ± 0.1 days and P B = 4.2 ± 0.3 days for the primary and secondary component respectively. These values are significantly longer than those derived from previous studies which were based solely on photometry. Our results suggest that the rotation period of each individual component depends strongly on its effective temperature as well as its surface gravity.",
    "We present an analysis of ellipsoidal oscillations induced in main-sequence stars by their substellar companions, and discuss prospects for detecting such signals with the Kepler mission. We find that these effects are detectable over a wide range of orbital periods (from 1 to 1000 days) and companion masses (0.1-10 MJ). The amplitude of the signal is proportional to the square root of the mass ratio between the star and its companion; it can be as large as 0.1% of the total flux at optical wavelengths. For typical parameters expected among planet-hosting systems, we estimate that this effect should produce a peak-to-peak variation in brightness on the order of 10 mmag or less. This level of precision will require several months of continuous observations using the Kepler spacecraft's photometer. However, if detected, the presence of such a signal would provide strong evidence for the existence of a low-mass stellar or planetary companion orbiting the primary star. \n \n Keywords: Ellipsoidal variations, Planetary system",
    "We study the dynamics of a probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with two species, prey and predators, which interact in an oscillatory way. The PCA is defined on a square lattice where each site can be occupied by at most one particle of either type. We show that for certain values of the parameters there are stable periodic solutions to this system. These results are obtained using a mean field approximation method. In particular we find that the periodicity depends only on the number of particles per unit area. This dependence agrees well with numerical simulations performed on finite lattices. Finally, we discuss how our model could be used as a simple description of population cycles observed in nature. Probabilistic cellular automata have been widely studied during recent years due to their potential applications in many fields such as physics [1] , biology [2] or computer science [3] . They consist of a set of cells arranged in some regular structure like a grid [4] whose state evolves according to local rules depending on its own state and those of its neighbors [5] .\nIn this work we consider a two-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton [6] consisting of N sites located on a square lattice L = Z 2 . Each cell i ∈ L has four possible states denoted by 0, 1, 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to empty space, prey, predator and dead. At time t = 0 all sites are initialized randomly with probability p 0 = 1/4 of being vacant, p 1 = 1/2 of having a prey and p 2 = 1/4 of containing a predator. Then, the evolution rule consists of applying simultaneously the following transition probabilities between consecutive times t and t + 1:",
    "The solar cycle is an important phenomenon in space weather, which can have significant effects on Earth and its technological infrastructure. The prediction of future solar activity has been studied for many years with varying degrees of success.  In this work we use mean-field models to predict the next solar cycle (24) based on data from previous cycles. We find that our model predicts the amplitude of the current cycle well but underestimates the length by about one year. Our results suggest that the Sun will enter into minimum phase around 2013-14 followed by maximum phase around 2017-18. This prediction agrees reasonably well with other recent predictions made by different groups. However, it should be noted that there are large uncertainties associated with these predictions due to the chaotic nature of the solar dynamo process. Future observations may help reduce some of these uncertainties. Keywords: Space Weather, Solar Dynamo, Mean Field Modeling, Prediction",
    "We present the results of our analysis on GRB 080916C, one of the most energetic bursts ever detected by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We find that this burst is consistent with being produced in an off-axis jet viewed at an angle θ ~ 60° to its axis. The observed light curve can be explained as emission from two components: (1) A bright component which peaks early during the prompt phase; it has a duration T90 = 1 s and a fluence Fγ = 2×10−6 erg cm−2. (2) An extended tail lasting for several hundred seconds after the end of the prompt phase; it contains about half of the total energy emitted by the source. Using detailed modeling we show that both these features are naturally reproduced if the burst was generated within a dense stellar wind environment surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. In particular, we demonstrate how the density profile of such winds leads to a double-peaked structure in the time integrated spectrum of the burst.",
    "We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations for four Galactic bulge globular clusters: Terzan 5, Lilll1, UKS 1, and Terzan 4 obtained with the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). The data were taken in two filters F160W and F222M during three orbits each at the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), as part of program GO-10775. We use these NIR images to derive accurate distances to all four clusters by comparing their observed magnitudes with those predicted using theoretical isochrones. Our results are consistent within uncertainties with previous distance estimates derived from optical photometric studies. For Terzan 5 we find d = 8.2 ± 0.3 kpc; for Liller 1: d = 7.7 ± 0.4 kpc; for UKS 1: d = 6.8 ± 0.5 kpc; and for Terzan 4: d = 9.0 ± 0.6 kpc.",
    "The aim of this thesis is the study and development of computational methods for prolongation structures, which are used as tools in geometric analysis. The main focus lies on the construction of explicit formulas for the prolonged action of vector fields on tensor bundles over manifolds with symmetries. In particular we consider Lie groups acting by diffeomorphisms on Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We present an algorithm that computes the prolonged action of a given vector field on any tensor bundle associated to such a manifold. This algorithm relies on the use of invariant bases adapted to the symmetry group at hand. As applications we compute the prolonged actions of some important examples like the Killing vector fields on homogeneous spaces and the conformal vector fields on conformally flat manifolds. Finally, we show how our results can be applied to construct new families of solutions to Einstein's equations. Keywords: Geometric Analysis, Manifold Symmetry Group",
    "We present an analysis of the distribution of gas, stars and dust in two nearby edge-on spirals with prominent bars (NGC 1365 and NGC 1530). We use high-resolution observations obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory to study the physical conditions of the interstellar medium along these systems. The main results are as follows:  - In both cases we find that the molecular hydrogen is concentrated on the leading edges of the bar, while atomic hydrogen follows closely the stellar light.  - The star formation rate peaks at the ends of the bar where the density of molecular hydrogen increases significantly. This suggests that the gravitational torques induced by the bar can trigger the collapse of dense clouds into new generations of young stars.  - The infrared emission associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shows a clear correlation between the location of this component and the regions of active star formation. - The comparison of our data with hydrodynamical simulations indicates that the observed structure of the ISM may be explained if the bar potential has been able to drive significant amounts of cold gas towards its inner Lindblad resonance.",
    "The statistical behavior of domain systems is studied by using the concept of entropy and its associated quantities, such as information content and mutual information.  The results are applied to several examples including the Ising model in one dimension with nearest neighbor interactions on an open chain or ring lattice. It is shown that for this system there exists a critical temperature Tc at which the entropy per spin vanishes continuously. For temperatures T > Tc it is found that the entropy per spin increases linearly with the number N of spins in the system while for T < Tc it decreases exponentially fast with increasing N . In addition we show how these concepts can be used to study phase transitions between different states of matter. We also discuss some applications of our approach to other physical problems.

    "We present new ultraviolet (UV) observations of star formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies within 10 Mpc using GALEX data and compare these to SFRs derived from optical emission lines, infrared luminosities, radio continuum fluxes, and UV-optical colors. We find that all methods agree well with each other when applied to normal star-forming galaxies but disagree significantly on low-luminosity dwarf galaxies where dust extinction is significant. The scatter between different estimators increases at lower luminosities due primarily to differences in how they treat dust extinction. In addition we show that there are systematic offsets among some of the estimators which can be explained by aperture effects or calibration uncertainties. Finally, we use our sample to examine the relationship between galaxy mass and specific star formation rate as measured by various techniques. Our results suggest that the most reliable estimates of SFR come from combining multiple indicators rather than relying solely on one method.",
    "We have investigated how different assumptions about the velocity distribution function (VDF) affect the shape of the observed line profile in the solar corona, using an analytical model for the VDF that includes both isotropic thermal motions and anisotropic nonthermal motions. We find that the inclusion of nonthermal motions can significantly alter the shapes of the simulated line profiles compared with those obtained assuming purely Maxwellian distributions. The effects are more pronounced when the plasma temperature decreases and/or the degree of anisotropy increases. \n \n In particular, we show that the presence of nonthermal motions leads to significant asymmetries between the red-and blueshifted wings of the line profiles. These results suggest that it may be possible to use observations of coronal lines to constrain the properties of the underlying VDFs. However, this requires accurate measurements of the Doppler shifts associated with each emission feature along the line-of-sight.",
    "We study the orbital evolution and stability properties of oligarchic co-orbitals in the Solar System, i.e., bodies with masses comparable to that of Jupiter which are trapped on orbits close to those of Neptune or Uranus for billions of years.  We show how these objects can be identified by their long-term dynamical behavior as well as by their current positions relative to Neptune's orbit. The existence of such bodies is confirmed by numerical integrations over timescales up to 10 billion years using the symplectic N-body code SyMBA. In addition we find that there exist at least two other stable regions where oligarchs may reside. These results suggest that the Solar System contains several dozen oligarchic co-orbitals:  - At least four known trans-Neptunian objects (Pluto, Charon, Haumea, Makemake) have been found to exhibit this type of dynamics; - There exists another region around 30 AU containing three additional bodies (Sedna, 2000 CR 105 , 2003 SQ 317 ); - Finally, our simulations indicate that there might also be an additional group of oligarchs located between 50-60 AU.",
    "We study the phase structure of a surface model defined by an energy functional that consists of two competing terms, one favoring smooth surfaces and another penalizing their curvature fluctuations. The latter is modeled as a harmonic term in the local mean curvature. We show that this model exhibits three phases depending on temperature T . At high temperatures (T > Tc), it behaves like a liquid; at low temperatures (T < Ts) it forms a solid-like state where all triangles are equilateral; for intermediate temperatures (Ts<T< Tc) we find a disordered glassy phase which can be characterized by its fractal dimension D = 2 − H ≈ 1.7 ± 0.1. This value agrees well with numerical simulations performed recently by other authors. \n \n In addition to these results, our analysis also provides evidence for a first-order transition between the ordered and disordered states. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our approach towards more realistic models of biomembranes.",
    "We consider an antenna combining scheme in which each user is equipped with multiple antennas and transmits its data to one base station (BS) using space-time coding techniques. The BS uses maximum ratio combining (MRC), zero forcing (ZF), or minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, depending on whether it has perfect channel state information (CSI). We derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity achieved by this system under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that ZF performs better than MMSE when there are more users than transmit antennas at the BS; otherwise, MMSE outperforms ZF. In addition, we find that the performance gap between these two schemes decreases as the number of receive antennas increases. \n \n Keywords: Antenna combining, downlink channel, MIMO systems, Rayleigh fading channels, space time codes",
    "We present the results of our study on chemical composition, molecular line emission, dust properties, and thermal balance in dense cores with metallicities ranging between 1/100 solar to 1/10 000 solar. We find that the gas temperature decreases by about 10 K as the core density increases for all metallicities studied here (1/100-1/10 000 solar). The decrease is more rapid than predicted by current models which assume constant temperatures throughout the cloud evolution. This may be due to an increase in the importance of grain-surface chemistry relative to gas-phase reactions at higher densities. In addition we find evidence for significant depletion of carbon onto grains even at high metallicities such as Z = 1/10 000 solar. Our observations suggest that the critical density above which CO becomes optically thick depends strongly on metallicity. At lower metallicities this occurs at higher densities compared to higher metallicities. Finally, we show that the observed abundance ratios are consistent with those expected if the clouds were initially chemically enriched by supernovae type II explosions.",
    "We consider forward stagewise regression (FSR) for linear models with nonnegative coefficients, which is an iterative procedure that adds variables to the model one at a time until some stopping criterion is met.  We show how FSR can be used in conjunction with the monotone Lasso penalty to produce sparse solutions whose support contains all relevant predictors while simultaneously ensuring their signs are correct.  The resulting algorithm has computational complexity similar to standard Lasso algorithms but produces more accurate results on simulated data sets as well as real-world examples involving gene expression microarray data. Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR), introduced by Frank & Friedman [1] , is an iterative procedure where each iteration consists of adding a single variable into the current set of selected features based on its contribution to the objective function. This process continues until some stopping criteria is reached such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or meeting a desired level of accuracy [2] . In this work we focus on using FSR within the context of linear models with non-negative coefficients. For example, if our goal was to find genes associated with breast cancer then it would make sense to only select those genes that have been shown to increase risk rather than decrease risk [3] .\nThe main advantage of FSR over other greedy selection methods like stepwise regression [4] is that it does not require any tuning parameters [5] . However, there are two major drawbacks when applying FSR directly to problems with large numbers of potential covariates [6] :  1) It may take many iterations before the final solution converges; 2) There is no guarantee that the final solution will contain all relevant predictors. To address these issues, Tibshirani et al. [7] proposed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). Lasso solves the following optimization problem:",
    "We present the first measurement of single-transverse-spin asymmetries (SSA) for hadronic dijets produced at midrapidity in p+p collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV using data collected by the CMS experiment during 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb-1 . The SSAs are extracted as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity, azimuthal angle between jets, and event centrality. We observe no significant dependence on any kinematic variable except that the magnitude of the asymmetry decreases with increasing jet rapidity. Our results are compared to theoretical predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations including higher-order corrections and parton distribution function uncertainties. \nThe measured values agree well within experimental and theoretical uncertainties. This is the most precise measurement of this observable performed so far. \n \n Introduction \n \n Single transverse-spin asymmetries have been observed in several processes involving polarized protons or neutrons [1] , such as inclusive pion production [2] , semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering [3] , Drell-Yan lepton pair production [4] , prompt photon production [5] , and direct photons [6] . These measurements provide important information about the spin structure of nucleons [7, 8] .\n \nIn particular, they can be used to test the validity of factorization theorems [9] which relate hard-scattering cross sections to partonic distributions inside the proton [10] . In addition, these observables may also shed light on new physics beyond the Standard Model [11] . \n \n For example, it has recently been suggested [12] that large single-spin asymmetries could arise due to the interference of two amplitudes describing different helicities of quarks emitted from longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy pp collisions. Such effects would violate parity conservation and thus constitute evidence for new physics [13] . However, there exists only one previous measurement [14] of single-spin asymmeties in hadronic dijet production at high energies. That study was carried out at RHIC [15] where the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision √sNN=200 GeV is much lower",
    "We consider the problem of finding an optimal first-order reduced basis space in the context of model reduction using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). We show that this can be achieved by solving a sequence of generalized eigenvalue problems associated with certain polynomials, which are derived from the original POD Galerkin formulation and its adjoint. The proposed approach is illustrated on two numerical examples. In particular we demonstrate how it allows to find a better approximation than standard greedy algorithms. This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP/K034494/1. Model reduction techniques have been widely used over recent years as efficient tools for reducing computational complexity when simulating complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) [1] . One popular class of methods relies on Proper Orthogonal Decompostion (POD), where one seeks to approximate the solution u(x, t) ∈ R N of a PDE system by projecting onto a low-dimensional subspace spanned by a set of orthonormal functions {φi(x)}Ni=1 [2] , i.e.,",
    "We report on our analysis of archival Chandra data for the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03, which shows evidence for excess X-ray emission below 1 keV (the \"soft-excess\"). We find that this feature is not consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung or line emission associated with any known atomic species and conclude it must be due to some other process such as inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons. The observed spectrum can be fitted well using an absorbed power-law model plus a blackbody component at kT = 0.2 keV; however we show that this fit is statistically unacceptable when compared against more physically motivated models including a combination of Bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton emission. In particular, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a second blackbody component improves the quality of the fits significantly over those obtained previously.  Using these new results, we estimate the total luminosity of the soft-excess to be Lx ~ 1045 erg s-1 within a radius of R500 = 2 Mpc. This value is comparable to the bolometric luminosities inferred for several nearby radio halos detected via their synchrotron emission.",
    "The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not there are any differences between the distributions of firm size and profitability, using data on Japanese firms for the period from 1971 to 2000. The results show that both firm size and profitability follow a log-normal distribution with different parameters. In addition, it was found that the growth rate of firm size follows Gibrat's Law while that of profitability does not. This suggests that the relationship between firm size and profitability may be explained by the fact that they have different underlying processes. Finally, we find evidence supporting the hypothesis that the process generating firm size has changed over time. We also find some support for the hypothesis that the process governing profitability has changed over time. These findings suggest that the relationship between firm-size and profitability can change over time depending upon changes in their respective underlying processes.

    "We prove that if an operator is adjointable, then it has dense range in its domain.  We also show how this result can be used to give another proof of the Magajna-Schwizer theorem on the existence of self-adjoint extensions for densely defined closed operators with equal deficiency indices. Let H be a Hilbert space over C. An operator T : D(T) → H is said to have dense range (or simply DR), where D(T) ⊆ H, if for every vector x ∈ H there exists a sequence {xn}n∈N such that limn→∞||xn−Tx||=0. In other words, the image of T contains no proper subspace of H. The following theorem shows that any adjointable operator must necessarily have dense range.   THEOREM 1.1. If T:D(T)⊆H→H is adjointable, then R(T∗)=D(T).",
    "We present new results on the X-ray spectrum and variability properties of Mrk 509, one of the brightest Seyfert galaxies observed by XMM-Newton. We find that its 0.5-10 keV continuum is well described by an absorbed power law with Γ = 2.1 ± 0.2 (χ2/dof=111/101) plus a reflection component modeled as a PEXRAV model with R=0.7-1.0 and NH=10-23×1022 cm-2. The best-fit parameters are consistent within errors to those found previously using Chandra data alone. No significant spectral changes were detected between different epochs separated by several months apart. However, we do detect strong flux variations at all energies during our observation period. In particular, there was a factor of 3 increase in the hard band count rate over about 20 ks followed by a slower decay back towards the initial level. This behavior can be explained if the source has been caught in a transition state where the accretion disk luminosity increased rapidly due to some instability or perturbation.",
    "We study the supersymmetry breaking patterns for vector multiplets transforming under non-adjoint representations of SO(N). We find that there are two distinct classes of theories, depending on whether or not the representation is real. In particular we show how to construct explicit examples with N = 1 and N = 2 supersymmetries which break all their supersymmetries spontaneously. Theories with adjoint matter fields can be obtained as special cases by taking appropriate limits. This work was supported in part by NSF grant PHY-0456735. Supersymmetry (SUSY) has been an important ingredient in many extensions of the Standard Model since its introduction more than thirty years ago [1] . It provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the Planck scale [2] , while at the same time offering new ways to understand gauge coupling unification [3] .\nIn recent years it has become clear that SUSY must be broken if one wants to make contact with experiment [4] . However, despite much effort over several decades [5] - [8] , no fully satisfactory mechanism for spontaneous SUSY breaking exists yet [9] . One promising approach involves using supergravity [10] - [12] to generate soft terms [13] - [15] which then trigger SUSY breakdown [16] - [18] . Another possibility is to use extra dimensions [19] - [21] where SUSY is broken either explicitly [22] - [24] or spontaneously [25] - [27] via boundary conditions [28] - [30] . A third option is to consider models based on local symmetries [31] - [33] such as gauged [34] - [37] or global [38] - [41] SUSY.",
    "The Standard Model (SM) predicts the existence of new heavy particles, such as W and Z bosons that are responsible for weak interactions between quarks and leptons. The Large Hadron Collider experiments have searched for these particles in their data sets but no evidence has been found so far. In this work we present an analysis to look for heavy vector-like fermions decaying into pairs of charged or neutral gauge bosons using proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS experiment during Run 1 period with center-of-mass energy √s=7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1 . We consider two benchmark models where one is based on SU(2)LxU(1)Y gauge group while another model is based on SO(10). For both cases we perform a detailed simulation study to understand signal acceptance and background contributions. Using our results we set limits on production cross-section times branching ratio for different mass points ranging from 0.5 TeV to 3 TeV.",
    "We study the stability of viscous shock waves for an ideal gas with viscosity and heat conduction, using the method of characteristics.  We show that if the initial data are sufficiently small then there exists a unique global solution to this problem which converges exponentially fast as t → ∞ towards the corresponding inviscid solution (the Rankine-Hugoniot condition). If the initial data have compact support we prove that the solution remains uniformly bounded on any finite time interval [0,T]. Finally, under some additional assumptions about the initial data, we establish the exponential decay of solutions at infinity. The results obtained here generalize those known previously only for the case when the pressure p(ρ) = ρ γ , where 0 < γ ≤ 1.1. Viscous shock waves play important role in many physical phenomena such as combustion theory or plasma physics. In particular they appear in connection with the so-called Riemann problems describing the interaction between two different flows separated by a discontinuity surface. For example, one can consider the following problem:  Find a function u(x,t), x ∈ R n , t > 0 satisfying the system of equations",
    "We present an exact hierarchical description of the reduced state and dynamics of open quantum systems in terms of a set of coupled equations, which we call the Hierarchy of Density Tensors (HDT). The HDT is derived by applying the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique to the von Neumann equation describing the evolution of the total system. We show that this approach allows one to retrieve all relevant information about the environment-induced decoherence process on arbitrary timescales. In particular, it provides access to the full spectrum of relaxation rates characterizing the decay of off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix as well as the stationary states reached at late times. As an example, we apply our formalism to study the dissipative spin-boson model with Ohmic dissipation. Our results are compared against numerical simulations based on the Quantum Monte Carlo Wavefunction method. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe understanding of how macroscopic objects behave under the influence of their environments has been a central issue in physics since its very beginning [1, 2] . This problem becomes particularly challenging when dealing with complex many-body systems such as condensed matter or biological ones [3, 4] , where the number of degrees of freedom involved can be extremely large. A powerful theoretical tool to tackle these problems consists in studying the dynamics of the reduced state of the system of interest S conditioned upon some specific measurement performed over the environmental degrees of freedom E [5, 6] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop efficient methods to describe the time-evolution of the reduced state [7, 8] . Among them, the so-called Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) [9] represents a promising alternative to other approaches [10, 11] due to its ability to capture non-Markovian effects [12] . However, despite being able to provide accurate predictions for short-time evolutions [13] , the HDM fails to reproduce correctly the asymptotic behavior of the system [14] . To overcome this limitation, here we introduce a new formulation of the HDM, called Hierarchy of Density...",
    "We present new spectroscopic observations for nine cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on Keck I telescope in Hawaii, and compare them to previous results. We find that all CVs show double-peaked emission lines which are characteristic features of accretion disks around white dwarfs. The line profiles change dramatically during outburst phases when mass transfer rates increase by several orders of magnitude compared to quiescent states. In addition we detect absorption components at red-shifted velocities in some systems indicating the presence of an extended disk wind or stream overflowing into the disk. These results provide important constraints on theoretical models of CV evolution. \n \n Keywords: Accretion Disk, Double-Peaked Emission Lines, White Dwarf, Cataclysmic Variables \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Cataclysmic variables (CVs), also known as dwarf novae, are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star and a late-type secondary star filling its Roche lobe. Mass is transferred through the inner Lagrangian point L1 onto the surface of the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disk surrounding the compact object. This process leads to periodic outbursts caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disk resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity over time scales ranging from hours up to years [1] . During these outbursts, the accretion rate increases by several orders of magnitude leading to strong winds and high temperatures in the disk [2] , while the system becomes fainter than usual due to obscuration effects [3] .\n \nThe study of CVs provides valuable information about the physical processes involved in accretion flows [4] , magnetic fields [5] , and angular momentum transport [6] . Furthermore, they can be used as distance indicators [7, 8] and probes of galactic structure [9] . \n \n 2 Observations & Data Reduction \n \n Our sample consists of 9 CVs observed between 2004 and 2007 using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) [10] mounted on the 10 m Keck I telescope located on Mauna Kea",
    "We present an analysis of synthetic stellar libraries used to calibrate photometric surveys, such as Gaia and LSST. We show that these libraries are not accurate enough for this purpose because they do not include all relevant physical processes in their models (e.g., convection). This leads to systematic errors when using them to calibrate photometry or derive distances. We demonstrate how we can use observations of open clusters with known ages and metallicities to test the accuracy of different synthetic libraries by comparing observed and predicted cluster properties. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on current synthetic libraries. The next generation of space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented amounts of data about our Galaxy. These new datasets require large efforts to be analyzed properly. One important aspect is the calibration of photometric surveys like Gaia and LSST which will deliver precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky. To achieve high precision results it is crucial to understand potential sources of error and biases introduced during the reduction process. In particular, one has to ensure that the derived absolute magnitudes M_(V) are correct within 0.01 mag over most of the color range covered by the survey. \n \n For example, if the distance modulus DM = 5log10(d/d_sun), where d is the true distance between us and the star and d_sun is the Sun’s distance from Earth, then a difference of 0.01 mag corresponds to a factor of 1.1 in distance. Thus, even small uncertainties in the absolute magnitude scale translate into significant errors in inferred distances. Therefore, it is essential to have reliable methods to determine the absolute magnitudes of individual stars accurately before deriving distances.  \n \n Currently there exist several approaches to estimate absolute magnitudes based on theoretical model atmospheres. However, these models often fail to reproduce observational constraints at low temperatures and/or high surface gravities. As a result, the resulting absolute magnitudes may deviate significantly from those obtained through other techniques, e.g., eclipsing binaries. Moreover, some of these models also suffer from incomplete",
    "The authors have used scanning tunneling microscopy to study the surface structure and electronic properties of single crystals of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi-2212). They find that, at low temperatures, this material forms pairs of holes which are bound together by an attractive interaction mediated by phonons. The binding energy is found to be about 0.5 eV per hole pair. This value agrees well with theoretical predictions for the strength of the pairing force between holes in these materials. \n \n In addition, they observe that the density of states near the Fermi level shows a strong dependence on the direction along which the crystal is cut. For example, when the crystal is cleaved parallel to its Cu-O planes, it exhibits a large peak in the density of states just below the Fermi level. However, if the cleavage plane is perpendicular to the Cu-O planes, no such peak appears.",
    "We present fitting formulae for the illumination of accretion disks by hot spots, as seen in Schwarzschild and rotating black holes (Kerr). The formulae are derived using ray tracing through the disk atmosphere with an approximate treatment of Compton scattering. We find that the dependence on the spin parameter is weak when the spot size is small compared to the radius at which photons decouple from matter. For larger spots we find that the effect increases strongly towards prograde spins. Our results can be used to estimate the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting and gravitational lensing on observed spectra. They may also provide useful input into models of X-ray reflection spectroscopy. \nIntroduction\n\nAccreting black holes produce bright emission lines in their X-ray spectrum due to reprocessing of hard X-rays emitted near the event horizon by cold material orbiting close to the equatorial plane. These features have been studied extensively over many years both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003 , Done et al 2004 . In particular, they show strong red-shifts indicating that the emitting gas orbits rapidly around the black hole. This rapid rotation causes additional shifts in energy due to relativistic Doppler boosts and gravitational lensing. Relativistic effects become more important if the emitting region has a high degree of rotational support or is viewed nearly face-on. It is therefore necessary to take these effects into account when interpreting observations of such systems. \n\nIn this work we consider the case where the illuminating source is located above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Such sources include magnetic flares produced within the disk itself or active regions associated with the inner edge of the disk. We assume that the disk is optically thick so that all radiation reaching it is absorbed and re-emitted locally. We use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the emergent flux from the disk under various assumptions about the geometry of the system.\n\nThe main goal of our study was to develop simple analytical expressions describing how the shape of the line profile depends on the properties of the system. To do this we performed extensive numerical calculations covering a wide range",
    "We report the discovery and characterization of USco 1606-1935, an unusually wide low-mass triple system with two M-dwarfs orbiting each other in a ~2 year period at a distance of about 100 AU (~33 light years). The third component is a late K-type star that orbits both stars on a much wider scale, with a minimum mass for this companion of 0.7 solar masses. We present near-infrared spectroscopy to determine the spectral types of all three components as well as their radial velocities. Our results show that the inner binary has a total mass of only 0.3 solar masses, making it one of the lowest-mass binaries known. This makes USco 1606-1935 an ideal target for future studies of planet formation around very-low-mass stars. In addition, we find evidence for significant orbital eccentricity in the outer orbit which may be caused by tidal interactions between the close pair and its distant tertiary companion.",
    "We present new photometry for the globular cluster NGC 1904, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board HST in four filters spanning the optical and near-infrared wavelength range. We find that this cluster has an extended blue horizontal branch (BHB), which is populated by both hot BHBs and blue stragglers (BSs). In order to study these populations separately we use two different methods. First, we select stars based on their location along the red giant branch (RGB); secondly, we perform artificial star tests using our best-fit model CMD as input. Both approaches yield consistent results. Our analysis shows that the fraction of BSs among all evolved stars amounts to f = 0.11 ± 0.01. This value agrees well with previous studies of other clusters. Using theoretical models we estimate the age of the cluster at t = 12 Gyr.",
    "We study the structure of the stationary distribution for an asymmetric version of the Target Process (TP). The TP is a continuous-time Markov chain on the integers, which has been introduced by Aldous and Pitman in their seminal work [1] . It can be seen as a model for the evolution of a population with immigration and emigration at fixed rates. In this article we consider a generalization where individuals are allowed to emigrate only if they have reached some threshold value k ∈ N 0 , i.e., the number of immigrants per unit time decreases linearly when the current size of the population increases beyond k. We show that under mild conditions there exists a unique stationary distribution π = (π(n)) n∈N0 such that π(k) > 0 holds true. Moreover, we prove that π satisfies a recursion formula similar to the one obtained for the original TP. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for π(1), ..., π(k+1).\nKeywords: Asymmetric target process, Stationary distribution",
    "We study the zero temperature (ground state) properties of the two-dimensional spin-glass model with nearest-neighbor interactions using an evolutionary algorithm, called genetic embedded matching heuristic (GEMH). We find that GEMH is able to reproduce the ground states obtained by simulated annealing and Monte Carlo simulations for different system sizes upto L=40. The energy distribution function shows a power law behavior at low energies indicating the presence of many metastable states. In addition we also observe a peak near E=0 which corresponds to the ground state configurations. Finally, we show that the average overlap between successive generations decreases exponentially as one goes away from the ground state configuration. This indicates that there are no other low-energy states apart from the ground state. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Spin glasses have been studied extensively over last few decades both theoretically [1]-[3] and experimentally [4] . They exhibit interesting features like frustration [5] , slow relaxation [6] - [8] etc., which make them very difficult to solve exactly even on small lattices [9] . However, it has been shown recently [10] that these systems can be solved efficiently if they are allowed to evolve under certain conditions [11] - [13] . Evolutionary algorithms [14] - [16] provide us with powerful tools to tackle such problems [17] - [20] .\n \nIn this work we consider the following Hamiltonian [21] :",
    "We present results on dust formation in primordial supernova remnants (SNRs) using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with detailed chemical networks for gas-phase species, grains, and molecules. We find that dust can form efficiently in SNR ejecta at high temperatures (T > 1000 K), but it is destroyed by sputtering due to collisions between ions and electrons when the temperature drops below T = 100 K. The surviving dust grains are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM). Our calculations show that the total mass of dust formed in primordial SNRs may reach up to 10^-4 Msun if we assume an initial metallicity Z = 0.1Zsun. This value agrees well with observations of nearby young SNRs. However, our model predicts too much carbonaceous dust compared to silicates observed in these objects. If this discrepancy persists after further improvements of the models, then some other mechanism should be responsible for producing silicates in SNRs. \n \n Keywords: dust, supernova remnant",
    "We present results for the chemical composition and temperature structure of two different models of dense molecular clouds, which are based on detailed microphysical calculations including gas-grain interactions. The first model is an isolated spherical core that collapses under its own gravity; it has been evolved up to densities of 10^8 cm^{-3}. In this case we find that grain-surface reactions play only a minor role because they occur mainly at low temperatures where the density is too small to allow efficient freeze-out onto grains. However, these processes can be important if the collapse proceeds faster than predicted by standard theory (e.g., due to magnetic fields). We also study the evolution of a protostellar envelope surrounding a newly formed star. Here we find that the formation of complex organic molecules such as methanol or formaldehyde requires high densities and relatively warm temperatures. This suggests that these species may not be abundant enough to explain their observed abundances in dark clouds unless additional sources of heating exist.",
    "The equilibrium fluctuations in isolated systems are studied by using statistical mechanics and information theory. The entropy production rate is calculated for different types of isolated systems: (i) closed, (ii) open, and (iii) dissipative. It is shown that the entropy production rate can be expressed as a sum over all possible transitions between states weighted with their respective transition probabilities. For closed systems it is found to be equal to zero at thermal equilibrium. This result agrees well with previous results obtained within linear response theory. In contrast, for open or dissipative systems we find that the entropy production rate does not vanish even if they reach thermal equilibrium. We show how this finding leads to a new interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, we discuss our findings in terms of fluctuation theorems.

    "We analyze the non-Gaussianity in the temperature fluctuations of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first year sky maps using three different estimators, namely Minkowski Functionals (MF), genus curve and correlation functions. We find that all these estimators show significant deviations from Gaussian predictions at large angular scales. The observed deviation is consistent with theoretical expectations for topological defects like cosmic strings or textures which are predicted to be present during inflationary phase transitions. These results provide further support for the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities in CMB anisotropies.

    "We study the representations of tame quivers with relations, which are finite-dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field k. We define the notion of ``affine canonical basis'' for such algebras in terms of their indecomposable modules. This is done by generalizing the results on the representation theory of preprojective algebras obtained by Crawley-Boevey and Holland to arbitrary tame quiver algebras. In particular we show that any indecomposable module has a unique maximal submodule (up to isomorphism); this allows us to give a combinatorial description of the indecomposables as well as of the Auslander-Reiten translation. The main result of our work is then the construction of an explicit bijection between the set of indecomposable modules and the elements of the affine canonical basis. As applications we obtain new proofs of several known results about the representation theory of preinjective algebras and of Nakayama algebras.",
    "We present an analysis of the correlation between radio sources in the southern sky with angular scales greater than 1 degree, and the temperature fluctuations observed by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We find that there is no significant correlation at large angular separations for any individual source population or combination thereof. However, we do detect a statistically significant cross-correlation signal when all extragalactic point sources are combined into one sample. The amplitude of this signal is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This result suggests that the cold spot may be due to a superposition of many unresolved SZ clusters along our line-of-sight. In addition, we show that the lack of correlation seen individually among different populations can be explained if these populations have differing spectral indices and/or luminosity functions. Finally, we demonstrate how the results presented here could be used as a testbed for future experiments such as Planck Surveyor.",
    "We report on the discovery and analysis of XMM-Newton observations of an uncatalogued, extremely faint X-ray source (X-ray luminosity < 1031 erg s-1) in the Galactic plane at l = 28 deg., b = 0.5 deg.. The source was detected only during one observation performed with EPIC-pn camera in 2003 February. We have analyzed all available archival data for this region obtained by different space observatories including Chandra, Swift/XRT, ASCA, RXTE/ASM, INTEGRAL/JEM-X, Suzaku/WAM, and HESS telescopes. No other X-ray sources were found within the positional uncertainty circle of the new object down to limiting flux levels of ~3×10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 (0.2-10 keV). This makes it unlikely that the source is associated with any known classes of X-ray binaries or active galactic nuclei.",
    "We present an algorithm for unicast and multicast quality-of-service (QoS) routing in the Internet using soft constraint logic programming (SCLP). The proposed approach is based on the concept that each node maintains its own view about the network topology, which may be different than other nodes' views due to link failures or congestion. We use SCLP as our underlying framework because it can naturally represent such inconsistent information among nodes. In addition, we show how to incorporate bandwidth constraints into the SCLP model by introducing new variables representing available bandwidths between two adjacent links. Finally, we propose several algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches significantly under various conditions.

    "We report the first experimental demonstration of two-electron interference in an electron microscope, using a novel technique to produce and detect entangled pairs of spatially separated electrons. The experiment is performed on a single atomically thin carbon layer deposited onto a silicon nitride membrane with a hole drilled through it. We observe that when one electron passes through the hole while its partner travels along a nearby path outside the hole, they interfere destructively at the detector placed behind the hole. This destructive interference effect can be explained by considering the phase difference acquired during propagation due to their different paths lengths. Our results demonstrate how quantum mechanical effects are manifested in real space as well as in momentum space. \n \n Quantum mechanics predicts that particles may exhibit nonlocal correlations even if they never interact directly. In particular, this implies that the wave function describing each particle must contain information about all other particles involved in the system. Such nonlocality has been demonstrated for photons1–3 but not yet for massive particles such as electrons or atoms4–6. Here we show experimentally that two electrons emitted simultaneously from opposite sides of a double-slit aperture do indeed interfere with each other despite being separated by more than 1 mm7.",
    "We present an analysis of the ages derived by applying the gyrochronological method to a sample of open clusters with known ages (from literature) in order to assess its reliability as well as possible systematics associated with it. We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually. As a result, other approaches must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars spanning different stages of evolution.\nGyrochronology provides another avenue for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity cycles driven by dynamo processes operating at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003) . It has been shown that the Rossby number R o , defined as the ratio between the rotation period P rot and the convective overturning timescale",
    "We present an approach to dependability analysis that is hierarchical in nature, and can be applied to any cache-based storage architecture. The main idea behind our approach is the use of a set of models at different levels of abstraction to represent the system under study. We show how these models are used together with simulation experiments to perform dependability evaluation on a commercial cache-based RAID storage architecture. Our results demonstrate that this approach provides significant advantages over traditional approaches based solely on analytical modeling or simulation experiments. In particular, we find that: (1) it allows us to obtain accurate estimates of reliability measures such as mean time between failures; (2) it enables us to explore tradeoffs among various design parameters; and (3) it helps us identify critical components within the system. Finally, we discuss some limitations of our approach and suggest directions for future research. Caching has been widely adopted by modern computer systems to improve performance through reducing access latency. However, caching introduces new challenges related to data consistency management and fault tolerance. This article presents a novel approach to dependability analysis of cache-based storage architectures.",
    "We report on the detection of an X-ray source, which is spatially coincident with the radio galaxy 3C 452 (z = 0.084). The observed spectrum can be described by a power law model modified by photoelectric absorption and emission lines at energies around 1 keV. We find that this object shows significant variability between different observations performed over several years. In addition to these features we detect a soft excess below 2 keV. This feature cannot be explained by thermal plasma models or reflection components alone but requires additional contributions from ionized absorbers and/or partial covering neutral material. Using our best-fit model for the time-averaged data set we derive intrinsic luminosities of Lx(2-10keV)= 4 x 1043 erg s-1 and Lx(0.5-2keV)= 5 x 1044 erg s-1. These values are typical for powerful FR II radio galaxies.",
    "The recent debate on the future availability of fossil fuels has focused attention on the possible implications of peak oil (the maximum rate at which economically viable quantities can be extracted) for global warming, particularly in relation to the Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets.  In this study we use an integrated assessment model that includes both economic growth and energy supply/demand dynamics to examine how different assumptions about the timing and magnitude of peak oil affect projected levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature change and sea-level rise by 2100 under business-as-usual conditions.   We find that if peak oil occurs before 2020 then it will have little effect on these variables because there is still time available to develop alternative sources of energy. However, if peak oil does occur after 2020 but before 2030 then its effects are more significant; depending upon the exact date and magnitude of peak oil, our results suggest that temperatures could increase between 1.5°C and 3.0°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 with associated increases in sea level rise ranging up to 0.7 metres.",
    "We present the second part of our study on non-metric gravity theory in which we find that there is no missing mass problem for quasars as claimed by some authors.  We also show that this theory can explain the redshifts of quasars without introducing any new parameter or concept into physics. In addition to these results, we discuss how this theory may be tested experimentally using gravitational waves produced by binary pulsar systems. The first part of this work has been published recently [1] . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years many authors have studied various aspects of nonmetric gravity theories [2] - [8] , but none of them seems to have considered the possibility of testing such theories with observations made on distant objects like quasars (QSOs). This is surprising because it was shown previously [9] that one particular version of non-metric gravity could solve the missing mass problem associated with QSOs. It should therefore not come as a surprise if other versions of non-metric gravity are able to do so too.",
    "We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the temperature dependence of tensile properties of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We used an optimized Tersoff potential for SWCNT and simulated three different types of SWCNTs with diameters 1 nm, 2 nm and 3 nm at temperatures ranging between 300 K and 1500 K. The results show that Young's modulus decreases as the temperature increases while the yield stress remains almost constant upto 1000K but starts decreasing beyond this point. This is due to the fact that thermal fluctuations cause defects in the structure which leads to decrease in strength. It was also observed that the strain rate has no effect on the mechanical behavior of SWCNTs. \n\n\nKeywords: Molecular Dynamics Simulations; Temperature Dependence; Tensile Strength; Carbon Nanotube Structures; Defects. Introduction: Carbon nanotubes are one dimensional structures made out of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged into hexagonal rings [1] . Due to their unique structural characteristics they possess extraordinary physical and chemical properties [2] , such as high elasticity [3] , high electrical conductivity [4] , high thermal conductivity [5] etc., making them suitable candidates for various applications [6] .\nCarbon nanotubes can be classified according to their diameter [7, 8] or chirality [9] . Depending upon these two parameters there exist several distinct families of carbon nanotubes [10] . In general, carbon nanotubes can be divided into two categories namely zigzag tubes and armchair tubes [11] . Zigzag tubes consist of alternating double bonds along its axis whereas armchair tubes contain only single bonds [12] . There exists another type called chiral tube whose helicity lies somewhere between zigzag and armchair tubes [13] . These tubes are characterized by a pair of integers (n,m), where n denotes number of unit cells in circumference direction and m represents number of unit cells in longitudinal direction [14] . For example, (5, 5) , (6, 6), (7, 7) and (8, 4) represent zigzag, armchair, chiral and achiral tubes respectively [15] .",
    "We study how the evolution of the Carter constant depends on the spin and mass ratio in binary systems with spinning black holes, using numerical relativity simulations. We find that the dependence is weak when the spins are aligned or antialigned but strong when they have an intermediate angle between them. The results suggest that it may be possible to measure the black hole's quadrupole moment by observing gravitational waves emitted during the late stages of inspiral. This would provide information about the spacetime geometry near the horizon which cannot be obtained otherwise. \n \n Introduction \n \n In this work we investigate how the evolution of the so-called Carter constant depends on the black-hole spin and mass-ratio in binary systems containing two spinning black holes. The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ). For example, the presence of a massive accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter constant even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr 1963). \n \n Previous studies have shown that the orbital evolution of binaries with non-spinning components is affected by the black-hole quadrupole moment Q = M(1 − S2)/c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999) . However, these effects become negligible once the black holes reach their final plunge phase due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such evolutionary processes, the black holes could acquire large amounts of angular momentum via tidal interactions and/or",
    "We propose an alternative switching mechanism for spintronic devices based on domain walls (DWs). The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer layer, where DWs can be driven between different positions in each magnetic layer using spin-orbit torques and electric fields. We show that this new type of device is able to operate at lower current densities than conventional spin valves with comparable magnetoresistance values. In addition we demonstrate how the energy barrier associated with the motion of the DWs can be tuned through changes in the thicknesses of both the ferromagnets and the non-magnetic spacer. This allows us to optimize the energy landscape such that the DWs are trapped in their equilibrium position when no external field or voltage bias is applied. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our proposal as well as its limitations. Spintronics has emerged over recent years as one of the most promising technologies for future information processing systems [1] . One of the main challenges faced by these devices is the development of efficient ways to control the flow of charge carriers without compromising their high mobility [2] .\nIn order to overcome this problem several groups have recently investigated the possibility of controlling the direction of electron transport via the manipulation of magnetic textures [3] , which include vortex states [4] , skyrmions [5] and domain walls [6] . Domain walls are particularly interesting since they can be manipulated electrically [7, 8] and thermally [9] , making them ideal candidates for low-power consumption devices [10] . However, despite significant progress made towards understanding the physics behind the dynamics of domain walls [11] , there remains much uncertainty about the exact nature of the mechanisms responsible for driving their motion [12] .",
    "The gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, but their origin is still unknown. The GRB associated with supernovae may be one possible source for these mysterious phenomena.  In this work we present an analysis of the data obtained by the Compton Observatory on board the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and show that there was no significant correlation between the time profiles of the GRB and the light curve of the supernova SN1987A. We also discuss some other possibilities which could explain our results. Keywords: Gamma ray bursts, Supernovae, Time profile, Correlation function. 1 Introduction   -Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), discovered more than twenty years ago [1] , have been studied extensively since then [2] . They are characterized by extremely bright flashes lasting only a few seconds [3] . Their energy output can exceed 1053 ergs [4] , making them the most powerful events known in the Universe [5] .\n-The first detection of a GRB was made using the BATSE instrument aboard the Compton GRO spacecraft [6] . Since then many satellites such as BeppoSAX [7] , HETE-2 [8] , Swift [9] , Fermi [10] etc., have detected thousands of GRBs [11] . However, despite extensive research efforts over several decades, the exact nature of GRBs remains elusive [12] .",
    "We present an analysis of the kinematics, metallicity distribution function (MDF), and chemical abundances in the outer halo of our Galaxy using data obtained with the Subaru Telescope for two fields along the leading arm of the Magellanic stream. We find that the MDFs are well represented by three Gaussian components centered at [Fe/H] = -1.7, -0.9, and +0.2 dex, respectively. The metal-poor component is found to be associated with the Galactic thick disk/halo population, while both intermediate- and high-metallicity populations show significant differences between the two fields. In particular, we detect a large fraction of high-alpha stars in one field but not in another located farther away from the center of the LMC. These results suggest that the origin of these streams may have been triggered by tidal interactions between the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies such as the Sgr dwarf galaxy and/or the LMC.",
    "The production of particles with large transverse momenta is studied in the fragmentation region for gluons and quarks produced by photons, Z bosons or W bosons.  The data are taken using the D0 detector operating at Fermilab's Tevatron Collider. Events containing jets that have high transverse momentum (pT) and low pseudorapidity () are selected to study particle production in quark and gluon fragmentation regions. In addition, events where one jet has pT>20GeV/c and another jet has pT>15GeV/c are used to compare the properties of these two types of jets. The results show that the fraction of charged hadrons increases as the number of constituent quarks decreases. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the probability of producing a strange quark is higher than that of producing an up or down quark. The mean multiplicity of neutral mesons also shows this trend but not as clearly as the charged hadron multiplicity does.",
    "We study the internal state of an isotropic packing of frictionless spherical particles under compression, decompression and cyclic loading by means of numerical simulations using molecular dynamics (MD). We find that the volume fraction increases with increasing applied stress in all cases studied here. The increase of the volume fraction during unloading is smaller than for loading at similar stresses. This hysteresis effect becomes more pronounced as the number of load-unload cycles increases. In addition to this we observe that the distribution function of contact forces changes significantly between different stages of the process. These results are discussed within the framework of elastic-plastic models of granular materials. Granular matter can be found everywhere around us; it forms the basis of many natural phenomena such as avalanches or landslides on mountainsides [1] , mudflow [2] , sedimentation [3] , soil mechanics [4] , earthquakes [5] . It also plays an important role in industrial processes like powder metallurgy [6] , pharmaceutical industry [7] , food processing [8] , etc.. Despite its ubiquity there still exist open questions about how granular systems behave mechanically [9] .\nIn recent years much effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanical behavior of granular media [10] - [12] . One of the most interesting problems concerns the response of granular material to external loads [13] - [16] . For example, one may ask what happens if you compress a sample of sand? What will happen when you release the pressure again?\nThe aim of our work presented below was to investigate these issues numerically [17] . To do so we used Molecular Dynamics (MD) [18] which allows us to simulate large samples consisting of thousands of grains [19] .",
    "We study the transverse momentum dependence of J/ψ and Υ production cross sections at RHIC energies within an effective field theory approach, which includes both elastic scattering off quarks as well as inelastic processes such as dissociation into open charm or bottom hadrons.  We find that the observed suppression pattern can be reproduced by including only elastic scattering for pT < 2 GeV/c while additional contributions are needed to describe data points with larger values of pT . The latter turn out to be dominated by inelastic processes like dissociation into open heavy flavor mesons. In particular we show that the inclusion of these effects leads to a significant reduction of the predicted nuclear modification factor RAA(pT ) compared to previous calculations based on purely elastic interactions. \nPACS numbers: 12.38.Mh, 25.75.-q, 11.10.Kk \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nThe measurement of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium (Υ) production is one of the most promising probes to investigate properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions [1] . It has been suggested that the interaction between the produced quarkonia and the surrounding medium may lead to their partial melting [2] , i.e., to a decrease of the bound state masses due to color screening [3] .\nIn this work we present results obtained within an effective field theory framework [4] , where the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons rather than individual hadronic states. This allows us to calculate the total cross section for quarkonium production in terms of elementary partonic subprocesses involving light quarks q = u, d, s and gluons g. These include elastic scattering off quarks and gluon-gluon fusion leading to the formation of quarkonia via the creation of a virtual qq pair [5] . Furthermore, inelastic processes such as quarkonium dissociation into open heavy-flavor hadrons [6] have also been included [7, 8] .",
    "We present optical spectroscopic observations for the sample of 14 extreme high energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) selected by Costamante et al. (2013) . The main goal is to study their host galaxy properties and investigate possible differences with respect to lower-energy blazars, which are known to be hosted in elliptical galaxies. We find that all EHBLs have redshifts between 0.1 and 1.0, consistent with previous results on this class of sources. All but one source show evidence of being hosted in spiral or irregular galaxies; only PKS 0537-441 shows an elliptical-like spectrum. This result suggests that there may not exist any significant difference in the hosts of low-and high-energy blazars as previously claimed. However, we note that our sample size is small and further studies will be needed before drawing firm conclusions. \n \n Keywords: Blazar, Host Galaxy",
    "We report on experimental measurements of spatial correlation functions for the dynamics of supercooled liquids at different temperatures, using confocal microscopy and single particle tracking techniques to probe the motion of colloidal particles suspended in glycerol. We find that these correlation functions can be well described by an exponential decay with a characteristic length scale which increases as we lower the temperature towards the glass transition point. This increase is consistent with theoretical predictions based on mode-coupling theory (MCT), but our results show deviations from MCT near the glass transition temperature Tg. These deviations are likely due to dynamic heterogeneities present close to Tg. The data presented here provide new insights into the nature of spatio-temporal fluctuations in glassy systems. Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow relaxation processes over many decades in time scales [1] . In particular, they often display non-exponential relaxations [2] , aging [3] , and other phenomena associated with glassy behavior [4] .\nTheories such as Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT) [5] have been developed to describe this complex phenomenology [6] . However, despite its successes [7, 8] , there remain open questions about how MCT describes real physical systems [9] . One important issue concerns the role played by spatial correlations between local regions where particles move more or less rapidly than average [10] . Such correlations may arise because of cooperative rearrangements [11] and/or dynamical heterogeneity [12] . It has recently been shown theoretically [13] that spatial correlations play an essential role in determining the shape of the intermediate scattering function Fs(q,t). Here q denotes the wavevector corresponding to the probed lengthscale, while t represents the lag-time used to calculate Fs(q, t).\nIn order to test whether theories like MCT capture all relevant physics, it is necessary to measure experimentally the spatial correlations predicted by those theories. Previous experiments [14, 15] have focused primarily on measuring temporal correlations [16] . Recently, however, several groups [17] - [20] have begun to study spatial correlations directly [21] .",

    "We present an exact expression for the energy density functional in terms of the local electronic charge and spin densities, which is valid for any number N of electrons on a two-dimensional jellium surface with arbitrary spin-orbit interaction strength. The resulting sum rules are shown to be equivalent to those derived by Stillinger and Lovett (SL) for the case of zero spin-orbit coupling but they also include additional contributions due to this term. We show that these new terms can be expressed as functions of the SL parameters only. This result allows us to obtain explicit expressions for all the relevant physical quantities such as the exchange-correlation potential or the magnetization profile at finite temperature.

    "In this work, we study the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for amplify-andforward multihop relay channels with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). We first derive an upper bound on DMT by using the cut-set theorem. Then, based on the derived upper bound, we propose two schemes to achieve the optimal DMT performance in different scenarios. In particular, when all relays have full-duplex capability, our proposed scheme achieves the optimal DMT at high multiplexing gain region; while if only half-duplex relays are available, then our proposed scheme can still achieve the optimal DMT except that it is achieved at low multiplexing gain region instead. Finally, simulation results show that both proposed schemes outperform existing ones significantly. Index Terms-Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff, Multiple-Input MultipleOutput, Amplify-and-Forward",
    "We have read with interest the recent preprint [1] . In this work we find that the authors' claim to set an upper bound on the lifetime of the electron is not justified because they did not take into account all relevant decay channels. \n \n We would like to comment briefly on their treatment of backgrounds as well as their choice of cuts used to select events. The main source of background comes from radiative Bhabha scattering e+e-→e+e-γ which has been studied extensively at LEP2 [2] , where it was found to be negligible compared to other sources such as two-photon processes or four-fermion final states (e.g., W pair production). This process can only contribute if one photon escapes detection; however, since photons are emitted almost collinearly with electrons/positrons, the probability of missing both photons is very small. Furthermore, the cross section for this process decreases rapidly when the invariant mass of the lepton pairs increases [3] .\n \nThe authors also use a cut on the total energy of the event, Evis>10 GeV, which removes most of these events. They do mention that there may still be some residual contamination due to radiative Bhabhas but argue that this will be suppressed by requiring the presence of additional jets. However, even though the jet multiplicity distribution does decrease slightly after applying this requirement, the effect is too small to compensate for the loss of signal efficiency caused by removing events with low visible energies. \n \nIn addition, the authors state that the contribution from radiative Bhabhas should be included in the systematic uncertainty estimate. However, this statement is misleading given that the quoted systematic error already includes contributions from many different sources including those related to the modelling of initial-state radiation [4] . \n\n\nFinally, we note that the authors present results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations performed with PYTHIA 6 [5] . It is known [6] that this generator underestimates the number of high-multiplicity...",
    "We study the glass transition of an ensemble of adhesive hard spheres with repulsive interactions decaying as 1/r6, where r is distance between particles. We find that this system exhibits two distinct relaxation processes at low temperatures: one fast process associated with local rearrangements within clusters of strongly bonded particles; another slower process related to collective motion of these clusters. The latter process can be described by mode-coupling theory (MCT) for colloidal suspensions. However, we show that MCT fails quantitatively when applied directly to our data because it does not take into account the presence of strong bonds which lead to additional slow modes. By introducing a simple modification to MCT, we are able to obtain excellent agreement with experimental results over several decades in time and frequency. This modified version of MCT also predicts correctly the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time near Tg. Our work shows how quantitative tests of theoretical predictions may help improve their accuracy and applicability range.",
    "The purpose of this research is to develop an integrated approach for sharing product information in the supply chain using Web services technology, which will allow companies to collaborate with each other more effectively by exchanging data over the Internet. The proposed system consists of three main components: (1) Product Information Management System, (2) Supply Chain Collaboration Framework, and (3) Web Services Technology. In addition, we have developed a prototype system that demonstrates how these technologies can be used together to facilitate collaboration between different organizations involved in the same supply chain network. This article presents our work on developing such a system. We believe that it has great potential as a tool for improving business processes across various industries. Keywords: Supply chain management, web service, product information management system, collaboration framework. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of e-commerce applications, there are increasing demands for efficient ways to manage products throughout their life cycles [1] . Companies need to cooperate closely with suppliers and customers so they can respond quickly to market changes [2] .\nIn order to achieve better coordination among partners along the supply chain, many researchers have been working towards integrating existing systems into one common platform [3] , where all parties could access relevant information about products at any time [4] . However, most current approaches focus only on providing technical solutions without considering the organizational issues associated with implementing them [5] . Therefore, it becomes important to understand both technological aspects and social dimensions when designing new e-business models [6] .\nThis study aims to address some of these challenges by proposing a novel method for managing product information in the supply",
    "We present an analysis of the photometric data for all known transiting planets discovered by microlensing surveys, including OGLE-II (Udalski et al., 2002) , MOA (Bond et al., 2001) and MACHO (Alcock et al., 1997) . We use these results to investigate whether any of them are likely to be false positives due to blending with nearby stars or other effects such as grazing eclipses.  The majority of the planet detections have been made using ground-based telescopes which cannot resolve individual sources in crowded fields. This means that it is possible that some of the detected signals may actually arise from multiple unresolved objects rather than single planets. In addition, there can also be significant contamination from background eclipsing binaries whose light curves mimic those expected from planetary systems. To address this problem we perform detailed simulations of each system taking into account realistic distributions of stellar masses and distances, as well as observing conditions at different sites.",
    "In this note, we present an elementary proof for the following theorem due to Pappus:\nTheorem 1 (Pappus' theorem). Let $ABC$ be any triangle and let $D$ be its incenter. Then the three medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersect at one point $K$ inside the triangle. \nProof. We first prove that the line segments $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are concurrent in one point $K$ by using only basic geometry. The idea is as follows. Consider the circle $C_1$ centered at $A$ with radius $AC$. Similarly consider circles $C_2$ and $C_3$ centered at $B$ and $C$ respectively with radii $BD$ and $CD$. Note that all these three circles have their centers on the same side of the triangle $ABC$. Now if we draw lines through $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ which are intersection points between the circumcircles of triangles $ABC$ and $A_1B_1C_1$, $A_2B_2C_2$, and $A_3B_3C_3$ then it can easily be seen that they will meet at one common point $K$.",
    "We introduce the notion of an algebra over a monoidal category and show that it is equivalent to the notion of a coalgebra in the dual category, which we call a comonoid.  We then define the cyclic homology of such algebras as the Hochschild cohomology of their underlying comonoids with coefficients in the bimodule given by the tensor product of the algebra with its opposite algebra.  This definition generalizes the usual one for ordinary algebras over fields or rings.   In particular, if the base ring has characteristic zero, this recovers the classical definitions of cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology.  The same construction also works for Hopf algebroids instead of ordinary algebras;  however, there are some subtleties arising when trying to extend these results to arbitrary commutative rings.    Finally, we give several examples illustrating our constructions. Cyclic homology was introduced by Connes in his seminal work on noncommutative geometry [Con] . It can be defined as the Hochschild homology of certain algebras called cyclic objects. These were first studied systematically by Bökstedt [Bök] , who showed how they could be used to construct new algebraic structures like crossed modules and group extensions. Since then, many authors have investigated various aspects of cyclic objects and their applications. For example, see [Fri1] , [Fri2] , [Koc] , [Lau] , [Maz] , [Nee] , [Sta] .\nIn this article, we will study cyclic objects in more detail using techniques developed recently in the theory of operads and monads. Our main result shows that any cyclic object gives rise to two different types of cyclic homologies, namely the cyclic homology of the underlying algebra and the periodic cyclic homology of the associated graded algebra. Moreover, both of them can be computed explicitly in terms of the structure maps defining the cyclic object. As a consequence, we obtain explicit formulas for the cyclic homology of all finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras over a field of characteristic 0.",
    "We study the random spatial growth in two dimensions, where new sites are added to an initially empty square lattice at randomly chosen locations and grow into circular clusters if they do not hit any existing cluster or obstacle site.  We show that this process leads to fractal structures which can be characterized by their fractal dimension Df = 1 + (1 - p)/2p, where p is the probability for adding a new site without hitting an obstacle.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying various aspects of the so-called Eden model [1] . In its original formulation it describes the growth of a single cluster on a two-dimensional substrate starting from one seed particle. This simple concept was later generalized to include several seeds [2] , as well as different shapes [3] .\nThe present work deals with another generalization of the Eden model: Instead of growing only one cluster we consider the simultaneous growth of many clusters competing for space [4] . As a result, some clusters may become trapped between other clusters leading to a complex pattern formation.",
    "We present new optical and near-infrared images, as well as archival radio data for the polar ring galaxy AM1934-563 (NGC4650A). The main results are summarized below:  1) We confirm that this galaxy is an edge-on S0/a with a bright nuclear point source surrounded by a faint disk.  2) A prominent dust lane crosses the central region in the north-south direction.  3) There appears to be no evidence for any recent star formation activity within the ring or along its edges.  4) The kinematics of the gas component show two distinct components; one associated with the ring itself and another which follows closely the rotation curve of the underlying stellar body.  5) The total mass of the gaseous ring amounts to about 10^9 M_sol. 6) The observed properties of NGC4650A can be explained if it has undergone a major merger event between two galaxies at least 0.5 Gyr ago.",
    "We present the first version of our new code, WHAM (Weno-Hybrid Arbitrary Mesh), which is based on the recently developed weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws in one dimension and multi-dimensions.  The main idea behind this method is to use high-order spatial reconstruction with an adaptive mesh refinement technique to achieve high accuracy at low computational cost. We have implemented several different versions of the WENO algorithm into our code including the fifth-order WENO-Z scheme as well as the third- and fifth-order WENO-JS schemes. In addition we also implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme along with the Harten-Lax-van Leer contact discontinuity capturing scheme to handle discontinuities arising during hydrodynamic evolution. Our results show that all these algorithms are able to produce accurate solutions when compared against exact or reference solutions.",
    "We present PdBI observations at 1.3 mm wavelength of the protostellar jet associated with the young stellar object (YSO) HH212, which is one of the best examples for studying the formation process of bipolar outflows driven by YSOs.

(4) The knots have a velocity width of ~100 km s-1 , while the ambient gas has a much broader linewidth up to 300 km s-1 .

    "We present new millimeter observations at 1.3 mm (230 GHz) with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), which resolve the dust continuum emission in the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 into two components, one located close to the central star and another farther out. The inner component is resolved by SMA for the first time and shows an elongated shape that can be fitted well by a Gaussian function with a FWHM size of 0.\"34 ± .\"01 × 0.\"21 ± .\"01. We also detect CO J=2-1 line emission toward this source using the SMA. By comparing our results with previous studies we find evidence for Keplerian rotation in both the gas and dust disks. Our data suggest that there are three distinct regions in the disk where different physical processes may take place: i) An optically thick region near the center of the disk; ii) a transition zone between the optically thin outer disk and the optically thick inner disk; iii) an extended optically thin region beyond 100 AU.",
    "The colour reconnection (CR) model is used to describe how quarks and gluons rearrange themselves into hadrons after they are produced by hard scattering processes, such as those occurring during e+e-annihilation events.  The CR model predicts that particles emitted close together in phase space will be more likely to recombine than those which are further apart.  This effect can lead to changes in event topology and kinematics compared to predictions made using models without CR.  In this analysis we use data collected by the Delphi experiment operating at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and 209 GeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb-1.  We measure the fraction of WW events where one or both W bosons decay leptonically for different ranges of dilepton invariant mass and compare these results to Monte Carlo simulations including and excluding CR effects.  Our measurements show no significant evidence for CR effects within our experimental uncertainties.",
    "We present an analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data for SN 2003du, which was discovered on February 28th by R. Puckett at Mt. Wilson Observatory (Puckett et al., 2004) .

    "We report an observation of a large coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with a halo-type flare that occurred in active region NOAA 10486 on 2006 December 13, which was observed by Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). The CME speed is estimated to be about 1450 km/s at 1 AU using STEREO observations. We find that this CME originated from a complex magnetic structure consisting of two opposite-polarity flux systems connected by a filament channel. In addition, we found that there were several small-scale brightenings around the main sunspots before the onset of the flare/CME activity. These brightenings are identified as ephemeral regions (ERs), which are known to play important roles for triggering eruptions such as flares or CMEs. By analyzing high-resolution images taken by Hinode/SOT/SP, we show that one of these ERs interacted strongly with the surrounding magnetic field lines during its rapid rotation. This interaction caused reconnection between open and closed magnetic fields, resulting in the formation of a current sheet below the ER. Then, the eruption started when the current sheet became unstable due to the kink instability.",
    "The Solar Chromosphere is an important component in our understanding of how the Sun works and its influence on Earth, but it has been difficult to study because of its tenuous nature.  ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) will be able to observe this region for the first time with unprecedented spatial resolution.   This talk will discuss some of the science that can be done using ALMA observations of the Solar Chromosphere. The Solar Chromosphere is one of the most enigmatic regions of the Sun. It lies between the photosphere and corona, and plays a crucial role in energy transport into the upper atmosphere. However, due to its extremely low density, direct observation of the chromosphere was not possible until recently when high-resolution images were obtained by space-based telescopes such as Hinode/SOT and SDO/AIA. In addition, ground-based observatories have also made significant progress towards studying the chromosphere through various techniques including spectropolarimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and speckle interferometry. Despite these advances, there are still many open questions about the physical processes occurring within the chromosphere which need to be addressed. For example, what causes the formation of dynamic structures like sunspots? How do magnetic fields affect plasma dynamics in the chromosphere? What is the relationship between chromospheric heating mechanisms and coronal mass ejections? These questions cannot be answered without detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the chromosphere. To address them we require new observational data at higher spatial resolutions than ever before.",

The calculated results show that MgSiO3 perovskites have high bulk modulus, low compressibility, large volume expansion coefficient at high temperature, and small thermal expansivity in comparison with other oxides. These properties are very important for understanding geophysics phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanic activities.  In addition to these physical properties, we also investigated the electronic structure of MgSiO3 perovskitie using density functional theory (DFT) method. We found that there exists a charge transfer between Si4+ ions and O2-ions which leads to the formation of Si-O bonds. This charge transfer causes the change of bond length and bond angle of Si-O-Si network. Finally, we discussed the effect of oxygen vacancy on the structural stability of MgSiO3 perovksite.",

    "We calculate the two-loop beta function for the coupling constant of the AdS5xS5 superstring theory and show that it is proportional to the one-loop result, which implies that there are no non-trivial fixed points at any finite value of the string coupling constant.  We also find that the dilaton field has an imaginary part when we take into account the higher-order terms beyond the leading order approximation. This indicates that our results may be valid only within some limited region of the parameter space where the imaginary part of the dilaton can be neglected. The present work was motivated by the recent study on the gauge/gravity correspondence between N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories with 16 supercharges and type IIB strings on AdS5xS5G5 backgrounds [1] . In this context, the existence of nontrivial fixed points would correspond to the conformal invariance of the dual SYM theories [2] , while the imaginary part of the dilatonic scalar fields would indicate the instability of the corresponding solutions [3] .\nIn Ref. [4] , the authors have calculated the one-loop beta functions for both the metric tensor and the dilaton field using the Green-Schwarz formalism [5] . They found that these beta functions do not vanish even if they are evaluated at vanishing values of the string coupling constants. However, their calculations were performed under the assumption that all the fermionic contributions vanish identically [6] . It turns out that such an assumption does not hold true [7, 8] . Therefore, it seems necessary to perform more detailed analysis taking into account the effects due to the fermions as well as those coming from the bosons.",
    "We study the radiative breaking of flavor symmetry in models with three generations of Majorana neutrinos and no hierarchy between their masses.

INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes all known fundamental interactions except gravity. It contains one generation of left-handed neutrinos whose masses are generated by the Higgs mechanism [1] , but it does not explain why these particles have such small masses compared to other SM fermions [2] .\nIn order to address this question, many extensions of the SM have been proposed over the years [3] . In particular, theories based on gauge groups larger than SU(3) C ×SU(2) L ×U(1) Y predict new states beyond those present in the SM [4] . These new states may include right-handed neutrinos [5] or scalar fields [6] . If they exist at low energies, they could lead to observable effects [7, 8] .\nOne possible way to test whether new degrees of freedom exist below the electroweak scale is through precision measurements [9] . Another possibility is to look for signals of new physics in rare processes [10] . Finally, if new particles are produced directly at high energy colliders [11] , then their properties can also be studied [12] .",
    "We present the first provably optimal cache-oblivious layouts for meshes with arbitrary aspect ratios and dimensions, which are based on recursive striping into rectangular tiles. Our results hold both in terms of worst-case performance guarantees as well as average case behavior under realistic assumptions about access patterns. We also show how to extend our techniques to handle more general data structures such as trees or graphs. The layout problem is formulated as an optimization problem: given a set of objects that need to be stored in memory, we want to find their positions so that they can be accessed most efficiently by future queries. In this work, we consider the following scenario: A large amount of data needs to be stored in main memory (e.g., a database). This data consists of many small objects (e.g., records) whose sizes vary greatly; some may even be larger than available space. To solve this problem, one could use a standard technique called blocking: each object is divided into blocks of equal size, and then these blocks are placed contiguously within the allocated storage area. However, if there are too few blocks per object, it will not fit entirely inside its assigned block; similarly, if there are too many blocks per object, the unused space between them cannot be used effectively.",
    "In this work, we study the distribution of the size of largest planar matching (LPM) and largest planar subgraph (LPS) in random bipartite graphs with n vertices on each side. We show that for any fixed integer k > 0, there exists an absolute constant ck such that if G is a random bipartite graph with n vertices on each part satisfying cn < p = e(G)/n < 1 − cn then LPM(G) has at least k components w.h.p.. Moreover, when p = 1/2 + o(1), we prove that LPS(G) contains a cycle of length Ω(log log n). These results are proved by using the second moment method together with some new techniques developed here to deal with the dependencies between edges. As applications, these results imply that both LPM(G) and LPS(G) have many small cycles under certain conditions.",
    "We present the clustering properties of star forming galaxies at z ~ 1, 2 & 3 in the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey (DIS) field using photometric redshifts derived by combining deep optical data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). We use two different methods to select our galaxy samples; one based on their observed NUV fluxes and another based on their intrinsic SFRs estimated from their UV luminosities. The results show that both these selection criteria yield similar clustering strengths for all three redshift bins considered here. However, we find evidence for evolution in the bias parameter between each redshift bin which is consistent with previous studies. In addition, we also study how this bias evolves as a function of stellar mass and UV luminosity. Our analysis shows that there are no significant differences in the bias values obtained when considering only those galaxies above or below a given threshold value of either stellar mass or UV luminosity.",
    "We present an assessment of the predictive power of galaxy formation models by comparing their predictions for rest-frame optical luminosity functions (LFs) with observations over the redshift range z=2-3. We use two different semi-analytic models, GALFORM and L-GALAXIES, to predict the evolution in number density as well as the distribution of stellar masses and star formation rates of galaxies across this redshift interval. The predicted LF is compared directly against observational data obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). In addition we compare the observed and predicted distributions of UV absolute magnitudes and dust-corrected colours. Our results show that both models are able to reproduce the overall shape of the observed LF but underpredict its normalisation by up to a factor of three. This discrepancy can be largely accounted for if one assumes that the majority of faint galaxies have been missed due to incompleteness effects associated with current surveys.",
    "We propose an excitable convolutional neural network (CNN) model for solving the 2D path planning problem in this work. The proposed method is based on the concept that the output of each layer can be considered as a potential field, and the final solution will emerge when all layers are combined together. We show how to train such a multi-layered CNN using backpropagation through time with gradient clipping. In addition, we also present two different methods to combine multiple fields into one single field by applying either linear or nonlinear combination functions. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on several benchmark problems including maze navigation, robotics motion planning, and autonomous driving. Keywords: Convolutional Neural Network, Backpropagation Through Time, Gradient Clipping, Maze Navigation, Motion Planning, Autonomous Driving. 1 Introduction Convolutional neural networks have been widely used in computer vision applications [1] . Recently, they were applied to solve various types of optimization problems [2] , which include image classification [3] , object detection [4] , semantic segmentation [5] , etc.. However, most existing works focus only on optimizing a single objective function [6] - [8] .\nIn many real-world applications, there may exist more than one objective function [9] . For example, in robotic motion planning [10] , it usually requires finding collision-free paths while minimizing energy consumption [11] ; in autonomous driving [12] , it needs to find safe trajectories under both kinematic constraints [13] and dynamic traffic conditions [14] at the same time; in medical diagnosis [15] , it should consider not only disease prediction [16] but also treatment recommendation [17] simultaneously; in computational biology [18] , it has to optimize protein folding [19] and drug design [20] at the same time. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop new algorithms to handle multi-objective optimization problems [21] .\nRecently, deep reinforcement learning [22] was introduced to address multiobjective optimization problems [23] . It learns policies directly from raw data without requiring hand-crafted features [24] . However, its performance heavily relies on the quality of training data [25] . Moreover, it often suffers from high sample complexity [26] due to the large number of",
    "We report on the detection by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) of prompt emission in gamma rays with energies above 100 MeV associated with GRB 080916C, one of the brightest bursts ever detected at high energy. The LAT data show that this emission is highly variable and peaks within 1 s after the onset of the burst. We find no evidence for spectral evolution during the first few hundred seconds following the trigger time. A simple power law fit to the LAT spectrum yields an index of -2.2 +/-.1 over the range 100 MeV - 10 GeV. This value is consistent with previous measurements made using Konus-Wind and AGILE satellites but differs significantly from those obtained by other instruments operating below 100 MeV. Our results are inconsistent with models which predict a softening of the photon spectrum as it evolves into the X-ray band. They also rule out scenarios where the high-energy photons originate solely from inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons accelerated in internal shocks. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst",
    "We present here a detailed discussion on the concept of allovalency, which is defined as the simultaneous binding to multiple sites in one molecule by different ligands (or receptors). We show that this definition does not apply to many cases where it has been used previously. In particular we discuss how multisite phosphorylation can be described within our formalism without introducing any new concepts or parameters beyond those already introduced for single-site phosphorylation. Finally, we argue why rebinding effects are negligible under most conditions relevant for signaling cascades. The concept of \"allovalency\" was first introduced more than 20 years ago [1] . It refers to the simultaneous binding of two or more ligands to several sites in one receptor protein [2] , see Fig 1(A) . This phenomenon occurs frequently during signal transduction processes such as kinase cascades [3] .\nThe term \"allovalent\" was coined because it describes a situation intermediate between monovalent and multivalent interactions [4] : while each ligand binds only once per receptor, there may exist several copies of the same ligand bound simultaneously to the same receptor. Allovalent interactions have been studied extensively both experimentally [5] and theoretically [6] . However, despite its widespread use, the precise meaning of \"allovalency\" remains ambiguous [7, 8] . For example, some authors define allovalency as \"the simultaneous interaction with multiple sites in one molecule via different molecules\" [9] . Others consider allovalency to occur when \"ligand molecules bind independently but cooperatively to multiple sites in one receptor molecule\" [10] . Yet others require that \"allovalent complexes must contain at least three components\" [11] .",
    "We report on the observation of an unusual temperature dependence of the resistive transition width and its scaling with the applied magnetic field for single crystals of MgB2 grown using chemical vapor transport (CVT). The observed behavior is explained within the framework of fluctuation induced vortex pinning, which leads to a reduction of the effective volume fraction of the sample that contributes to the resistance at low temperatures. This effect becomes more pronounced when increasing the external magnetic field strength. We find evidence for this scenario by studying the magnetoresistance as well as the anisotropy of the upper critical fields Hc2(0) and Hc3(0), where we observe a strong increase towards lower temperatures. Our results are consistent with recent theoretical predictions based on microscopic calculations. \n \n In addition, our data show clear signatures of quantum oscillations originating from the Fermi surface topology of MgB2. These observations provide further insight into the electronic structure of this material.",
    "We present the results of subjective evaluation experiments conducted on forms designed for use within immersive environments, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The goal is to investigate how users perceive different form designs when immersed in these environments. We compare three designs: traditional 2D forms, 3D forms that are rendered using perspective projection, and 3D forms that are rendered with orthographic projection. Our findings show that there were no significant differences between the two types of 3D forms. However, both 3D forms received significantly higher ratings than their 2D counterparts. This suggests that 3D forms can be used effectively in immersive environments without requiring special rendering techniques or additional hardware. In addition, we found that participants preferred forms that had more visual cues indicating depth information over those that did not have any such cues. Finally, our study also shows that it may be possible to create effective forms by combining elements from multiple existing designs.",
    "We revisit the foundations of quantum mechanics by introducing an alternative formulation to the standard Feynman path integral approach, which is based on the concept of dynamical phase transition (DPT). We show that this new formalism provides a natural description for the emergence and evolution of macroscopic order in open quantum systems. In particular we demonstrate how it can be used to describe the spontaneous emission process in atomic physics, where the atom-field interaction leads to the formation of collective states with well-defined photon number statistics. The proposed framework also allows us to study the dynamics of many-body interacting systems beyond mean field theory. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to condensed matter physics and quantum information science. Introduction:-The development of modern theoretical approaches has led to significant progress in understanding the physical properties of complex quantum systems [1] . However, despite these advances there are still fundamental questions about the nature of quantum phenomena that remain unanswered [2] .\nIn recent years, several authors have attempted to address some of these issues using concepts borrowed from statistical mechanics [3] , such as entropy [4] or free energy [5] . These ideas were originally developed within the context of classical thermodynamics [6] but they have been recently extended to the realm of quantum mechanics [7, 8] . For example, one may consider the von Neumann entropy S = −Tr(ρ ln ρ) associated with the density matrix ρ describing the state of a system [9] . This quantity measures the amount of uncertainty present in the measurement outcomes [10] and its time derivative dS/dt gives rise to the so-called entropy production rate [11] . It was shown that this latter quantity plays a crucial role in characterizing the irreversible behavior of closed quantum systems [12] . More specifically, if the entropy production rate vanishes then the corresponding quantum mechanical model exhibits reversible dynamics [13] . On the other hand, when the entropy production rate becomes positive the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition [14] .",
    "In this work, we study spin effect on resonant tunneling characteristics in double-barrier heterostructure under longitudinal stresses by using transfer matrix method and density functional theory (DFT). We find that the energy gap decreases with increasing stress for both majority-spin electrons and minority-spin holes. The decrease is more significant for minority-spin holes than for majority-spin electrons. In addition, the transmission coefficient increases with increasing stress at low bias voltage but decreases at high bias voltage. This behavior can be explained as follows. At low bias voltage, the increase of transmission coefficient results mainly from the reduction of barrier height due to compressive stress. However, at high bias voltage, the decrease of transmission coefficient comes from two factors: one is the increase of effective mass induced by tensile stress; another is the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction caused by tensile stress. Finally, it should be noted that our calculation shows that the spin-orbit coupling has little influence on the transport properties of the system considered here.",
    "We present results from direct cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that follow the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei, their subsequent evolution through mergers with other SMBHs, and the associated feedback on galaxy properties. We find that:  The simulated SMBH mass function agrees well with observations at z = 0 for M• > 10^7M_solar.  At higher redshifts, our model predicts too many low-mass SMBHs compared to observational estimates based on quasar luminosity functions; this discrepancy may be due to uncertainties in the assumed duty cycle or radiative efficiency of quasars.  Our models predict an average Eddington ratio distribution that is consistent with observed distributions inferred from optical/UV emission lines.  In addition, we show that the predicted relation between BH mass and bulge velocity dispersion agrees reasonably well with observations over four orders of magnitude in BH mass.",
    "The search is performed using data collected by the BABAR experiment at SLAC in 1999-2000, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 40 fb-1 . No signal candidates are observed and upper limits on the branching fraction are set as a function of the mass of the lepton pair.  These results improve upon previous measurements made with similar techniques but smaller datasets. The analysis uses a technique that exploits the kinematic properties of the final state particles to suppress backgrounds. This method has been used previously to measure the branching fractions of other rare decays such as B+ --> K*(892)0 pi+ , B+ --> D*0 pi+ , and B+ --> J/psi K- .\nPACS numbers: 11.30.Er, 12.15.Hh, 13.20.He  We report here our measurement of the branching fraction for the decay B+ --> gamma +l+nu (where l = e or mu), which proceeds through one-loop electroweak penguin diagrams involving W bosons and heavy quarks. In this process, the photon arises from the internal bremsstrahlung of the charged lepton produced in association with the neutrino. The Standard Model predicts a branching fraction of 1.1 x 10-6 [1] . A number of extensions to the Standard Model predict enhancements over this value [2] .  For example, supersymmetric models can enhance the rate by several orders of magnitude [3] ; however, these predictions depend strongly on the masses of the superpartners involved [4] .",
    "We study the effect of interactions on the transport properties of double quantum dot systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations. We find that the system undergoes a transition to an interacting topological phase as we increase the strength of the interaction. The critical value of the interaction at which this occurs is found to be strongly dependent upon the level spacing statistics of the underlying single-particle spectrum. In particular, it decreases rapidly when the distribution becomes more localized around zero energy. This behavior can be understood by considering how the density of states evolves under RG flow. Finally, we show that the fluctuations in the local magnetic moment are suppressed near the transition point due to the formation of singlet pairs. DOI: 10.1063/1.5015481\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe recent discovery of Majorana fermions has led to renewed interest in studying non-abelian anyons in condensed matter physics [1] . One promising candidate for realizing such exotic particles is provided by semiconductor nanowires [2] , where they may appear as end modes of the wire [3] or as excitations bound to vortex cores [4] .\nIn order to realize these proposals experimentally, one must first understand the effects of disorder [5] , electron-electron interactions [6] , and other sources of decoherence [7, 8] on the stability of the Majorana edge state [9] . A number of theoretical studies have been carried out recently [10] - [42] addressing some aspects of these issues. However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay among various physical mechanisms responsible for the appearance of Majoranas in realistic experimental setups.\nOne important issue concerns the role played by interactions in determining the nature of the ground state of the system. It was shown previously that repulsive interactions tend to favor the formation of a spin-singlet state over a triplet state [43] . On the other hand, attractive interactions lead to the opposite situation, i.e., the formation of a spin-triplet state instead of a singlet state [44] . These results were obtained",
    "We present exact solutions for the electromagnetic field in the presence of spherical particles with arbitrary dielectric functions, including both metals and insulators. We show that these results can be obtained by solving Maxwell's equations using an appropriate Green function approach. The resulting expressions are used to calculate the dispersion relations for surface plasmons (SPs) and surface phonons (SPhPs). In particular we find that SPs exist only when the real part of the dielectric constant is negative while SPhPs exist even if it has positive values. Finally, we compare our results against those obtained within the classical Drude model and discuss their validity limits. Surface plasmons (SPs), which are collective oscillations of conduction electrons at metal-dielectric interfaces, have been extensively studied over many decades [1] . They play important roles in various fields such as optics [2] , electronics [3] , sensing [4] , and catalysis [5] .\nRecently there has also been growing interest in studying surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs), which are analogous excitations associated with longitudinal acoustic waves [6] . These modes occur not only at surfaces but also inside bulk materials [7, 8] where they may lead to enhanced thermal transport [9] or thermoelectricity [10] . Moreover, SPhPs can couple strongly to light [11] leading to interesting phenomena like superprism [12] and extraordinary transmission [13] effects.",
    "We present new results on the kinematics and dynamics of the circumnuclear region (CNR) of NGC 1097, based on integral field spectroscopy with SINFONI at VLT/UT4. We find that the CNR is dominated by two components: an inner disk-like structure extending to about 1 kpc radius, and a fast outflowing component along PA∼45°extending up to 5 kpc distance from the nucleus. The latter shows blueshifted emission lines indicating radial velocities between -500 km/s and -1000 km/s relative to systemic velocity. This outflow has been previously detected using optical IFU data as well as HST imaging. In addition we detect a second slower outflow component perpendicular to this one, which extends over 3 kpc towards north-east direction. Both outflows are likely driven by nuclear jets originating from the central engine. Using simple models for the gas distribution and kinematics, we estimate mass inflow rates into the CNR ranging from 0.1 M⊙ yr-1 to several solar masses per year.",
    "We present the two-loop corrections to nuclear matter within an effective field theory approach based on chiral perturbation theory and relativistic mean-field theory. The calculation is performed using dimensional regularization, minimal subtraction at one loop order and the modified minimal subtraction scheme at higher orders. We find that the results are consistent with previous calculations obtained by other methods such as Feynman diagrams or dispersion relations. In addition we show how our method can be used to calculate the energy density functional up to next-to-next-to-leading order.

    "We report the discovery of a new satellite galaxy, dubbed \"A pair of bootes\" (ApoBootes), orbiting around our Galaxy at a distance of about 300 kpc in projection and with an estimated mass of 1.5 x 10^10 M_sun . ApoBootes is located on the opposite side of the Galactic center to the Magellanic Clouds and has a very low surface brightness. We have used deep near-infrared images taken by the VISTA telescope as part of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea survey to identify this object. The photometric properties are consistent with those expected for a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project funding scheme under grant DP130104011. We present evidence that ApoBootes may be associated with a previously known overdensity of stars discovered by Belokurov et al. (2007) using SDSS data.",

    "We report on an imaging survey carried out in 2004-05 using speckle differential imager (SDI) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). We have detected no companions down to ~5 AU projected separation within 50 mas of 45 young stars. The detection limits are estimated by injecting fake planets into real data sets and recovering them through PSF subtraction techniques. Our results suggest that there is little or no excess number of close-in giant planets orbiting these nearby young stars compared to field stars. This result may be explained if most extrasolar planets form beyond 5 AU but migrate inward during their formation process. Alternatively, it could also mean that planet formation is suppressed near the central star due to photoevaporation and/or tidal effects.  These results will provide important constraints on models of planet migration as well as planet formation theories. Keywords: Planet search; Nearby stars",
    "We present an analytical model for the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in protoplanetary disks, which is based on the assumption that the disk can be divided into two regions with different physical properties and dynamics. The inner region has a high density and temperature, while the outer one is less dense but hotter than the surrounding medium. We show how this simple picture allows us to reproduce many observed features of MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks around young stars. In particular, we find that:  -The growth rate of the fastest growing mode decreases rapidly towards smaller radii due to the increasing gas pressure.  -The radial profile of the turbulent viscosity follows closely the profile of the magnetic field strength.  -The angular momentum transport efficiency increases strongly at small radii because of the rapid increase of the surface density there.  -The predicted mass accretion rates are consistent with those inferred observationally for T Tauri stars.",
    "We present near-infrared (NIR) polarimetry and spectroscopy for the bipolar reflection nebula IRAS 19312; 1950 . The NIR polarization vectors are aligned with those in optical images, indicating that they trace scattered light from an illuminating source located behind the dense molecular cloud core. We find evidence for two distinct scattering regions along our line-of-sight to this object; one is associated with the brightest part of the nebula, while another region shows lower polarization degrees but higher polarized fluxes at longer wavelengths. These results suggest that there may be multiple sources contributing to the observed emission. In addition, we detect several absorption features which can be attributed to water ice on dust grains near the central star(s). Our observations also reveal a possible outflow cavity traced by blueshifted CO emission lines.

    "We present an analysis of the first two years (Feb 2005 -Jan 2007) of data taken by the Swift satellite, which has been designed to detect and study gamma ray bursts (GRBs). We find that GRB 050904 at z = 6.3 is the most distant object ever detected in the electromagnetic spectrum. The prompt emission was observed over more than four orders of magnitude in energy, from radio waves up to X-rays. This burst also had one of the highest fluences recorded so far for any GRB. In addition we report on another burst, GRB 080913, whose afterglow was found to be variable on timescales as short as 1 minute. These results are discussed within the context of current models for GRB production. Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, High-redshift universe, Afterglows, Swift satellite. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of high-energy radiation lasting only milliseconds, have now been discovered out to redshifts greater than six [1] . Their extreme luminosities make them powerful probes into the early Universe [2] , but their origin remains unknown [3] .\nSwift [4] , launched in November 2004, carries three instruments capable of detecting GRBs across the entire electromagnetic spectrum [5] : the Burst Alert Telescope [6] detects GRBs via their X-ray and/or optical emissions; the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope [7] observes the afterglow through ultraviolet and visible light; and the X-ray telescope [8] monitors the afterglow's decaying flux. Here we describe our initial findings using these instruments during the first two years of operation. \nThe Burst Alert Telescope\n\nBurst Alert Telescope Observations of GRB 050904\nOn September 5 th , 2006, the Burst Alert Telescope triggered on a bright source located at RA=05h54m36.6s Dec=-69d21'59.6\" [9] .

    "We study the interplay between thermal percolating states and jammed states in disordered systems by using Monte Carlo simulations for dimers adsorbing onto binary alloy surfaces with different compositions. We find that there is an optimal composition at which both types of states coexist, leading to a maximum entropy production rate. The coexistence state has been observed experimentally as well. Our results provide new insights into how energy can be transferred most efficiently through complex networks. Energy transfer efficiency plays a crucial role in many physical processes such as heat conduction [1] , chemical reactions [2] , and biological transport [3] . In particular, it determines whether or not a system will reach equilibrium [4] .\nIn this work we focus on one specific type of non-equilibrium process -thermal percolation [5] . Thermal percolation occurs when particles are injected randomly into a network [6] . Particles then diffuse along the network until they encounter each other [7, 8] . When two particles meet, their energies combine irreversibly [9] . This leads to a cascade-like spreading of particle density [10] . As more particles are added, the number of clusters increases [11] . Eventually these clusters merge together [12] forming a single cluster spanning across the entire network [13] . At this point all particles have combined into a giant cluster [14] . It was shown recently [15] that the transition from isolated clusters to a single connected cluster corresponds to a phase transition [16] . For example, in the case of random resistor networks [17] , the transition temperature T c depends only on the average resistance R av [18] :\n, where k B is Boltzmann's constant [19] . However, if the distribution of resistances P (R) is broad enough [20] , the transition becomes first-order [21] .",
    "We report on the controlled collision between an individual trapped atom and a singly charged ion in a Paul trap, where both particles are confined to different regions of space separated by several micrometers. The ions can be moved along the axis connecting them with the atoms using electrostatic fields generated by electrodes outside the vacuum chamber. We demonstrate that this allows us to control the relative velocity at which they collide as well as their impact parameter. This opens up new possibilities for studying fundamental processes such as elastic scattering or charge exchange reactions. In addition we show how it is possible to use these techniques to prepare entanglement between two neutral atoms via a quantum gate operation mediated by one common ion. Quantum information processing requires scalable systems based on many qubits [1] . One promising approach towards realizing such devices relies on neutral atoms stored in optical lattices [2] , but suffers from limited coherence times due to spontaneous emission [3] . An alternative route involves storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped ions [4] . However, here too there exist severe limitations arising from decoherence caused by heating [5] .\nIn order to overcome these difficulties, hybrid approaches have been proposed [6] combining advantages of both schemes [7, 8] . Here, the storage of quantum states takes place in a small number of highly coherent ions while large numbers of neutral atoms serve as flying qubits [9] . A crucial requirement for implementing such schemes is the ability to perform high-fidelity operations involving both types of qubit [10] . For example, it has recently been shown experimentally [11] that it is possible to entangle two neutral atoms via a shared ion [12] . To achieve this goal, however, the atoms need to interact with each other before being released into free flight [13] .",
    "The chemical compositions of the type II Cepheid variables are investigated by using high-resolution spectra obtained with Subaru/HDS, Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES, and McDonald/DEIMOS spectrographs.  We find that all of our sample stars have solar or super-solar metallicities ([Fe/H]>+0.2). In addition to Fe I lines, we also use Mg I triplet lines in order to determine their atmospheric parameters more accurately. For some of these stars, we detect significant overabundances for CNO elements as well as s-process elements; however, there is no clear correlation between the abundance patterns and pulsation periods. These results suggest that the observed abundance anomalies may be caused by mass transfer during binary evolution rather than internal mixing processes associated with stellar pulsations.

    "We study the slow wave resonance (SWR) effect for periodically layered media with an arbitrary number N of anisotropic layers, each characterized by its own permittivity tensor and thickness. We show that SWR is possible only if all principal axes of the permittivity tensors are parallel to one another within each layer. In this case we derive explicit expressions for the dispersion relation between the frequency f and the Bloch wavenumber kx. The results obtained can be used as guidelines for designing multilayered structures exhibiting strong SWR effects at low frequencies. \n \n Keywords: Slow wave resonance; Anisotropy; Multilayer structure; Dispersion relations. 1 Introduction \n \n Periodic multilayers consisting of alternating thin films made of different materials have attracted considerable attention during recent years due to their unique properties [1] . These include high reflectance [2] , negative refraction [3] , enhanced nonlinear optical response [4] , etc., which make them promising candidates for various applications such as optoelectronic devices [5] or photovoltaics [6] .\n \nIn particular, it has been shown recently [7–9] that periodic multilayers composed of anisotropic layers may exhibit very interesting electromagnetic phenomena including slow wave resonance (S WR). This phenomenon occurs when the phase velocity of the Bloch waves becomes equal to zero inside the medium [10] . It leads to extremely large values of the effective refractive index n eff = c / v ph [11] where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v ph is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch mode [12] . As a result, the corresponding transmission spectrum exhibits sharp peaks associated with narrow stop bands [13] . Such features are highly desirable for many practical applications [14] . \n \n However, despite numerous theoretical studies devoted to S WR in periodic multilayers [15–18] , there still exist several open questions related to the conditions under which this phenomenon takes place [19, 20] . For example, it was found experimentally [21] that the presence of a single misaligned anisotropic layer destroys the S WR effect completely even though other layers remain perfectly aligned. On the other hand, numerical simulations [22] suggest that",

We use photometric redshift techniques to select LAE candidates within a narrow window around each quasar's emission line redshift. The M/L values are derived using SED fitting for individual galaxies as well as stacked samples. Our main conclusions are:\n(1) For individual objects we find that the median value of log(M/LB) is ~-1.8 dex over the range of luminosities probed here.  This result suggests that most LAEs have low stellar masses compared to typical LBGs.\n(2) Stacking analyses show that the average M/LB increases towards higher luminosity bins. In particular, the highest luminosity bin has an average log(M/LB ) = -1.3 ± 0.4 dex which corresponds to a factor of 3 lower than what would be expected if these systems were dominated by old stars alone.",
    "We report on results obtained by INTEGRAL observations during the 2005 outburst of the black hole candidate GRO J1655â€“40 (Nova Muscae 1991). The source was observed in the 20-100 keV range for about 100 days, starting at MJD 53000 and ending at MJD 53300. We have analyzed these data using both ISGRI and SPI instruments aboard INTEGRAL satellite. In addition to the main spectral component which is well described by a power law model modified by an exponential cutoff, we find that there are two additional components present in the spectrum. One of them has been previously reported by other authors but its origin remains unclear. Another one appears only when fitting the whole dataset simultaneously with all three models considered here -power law plus exponential cut-off, broken power law or Comptonization model-. This new feature can be interpreted either as a reflection hump produced by cold material surrounding the central X-ray source or as a broad iron line around 6.4 keV.",
    "We study the remnants produced by merging two CO WDs with different masses and spin configurations, using fully general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that for most cases studied here (except when one WD is very massive), the merger product will be an ellipsoidal object surrounded by a thick disk-like structure. The final mass of this merged system ranges between 0.6-1.1 M⊙ depending on the initial conditions. For some systems we also observe the formation of a thin accretion disk around the central core. In addition to these results, we show that there are several possible outcomes in terms of the amount of material ejected during the merger process. Depending on the total mass of the binary system, the merger can produce either no or significant amounts of ejecta ranging up to 10−2M⊙. Finally, we discuss how our results compare with previous studies as well as future prospects. \n \n Keywords: White dwarfs",
    "Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are widely used in the field of telecommunication and sensing applications due to their high gain, low noise figure, wide bandwidths and compatibility with silica fibers. However, EDFAs have some disadvantages such as high cost and limited lifetime because they require expensive rare-earth elements like erbium ions. In this study, we report on the preparation of new glass-ceramic materials based on sodium chloride and potassium chloride phosphates containing different concentrations of Er3+ ions by melt-quenching method. The structural characterization was performed using X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature between 300 nm and 1600 nm. Photoluminescence emission measurements were carried out under 980-nm excitation wavelength. It is found that the prepared samples show good transparency over a broad range of wavelengths up to 1600 nm.",
    "We present new spectroscopic observations for the open cluster NGC 1883, which is located at a distance of about 1 kpc in the constellation Cassiopeia (α = 20 h 18 m , δ = +58°). The data were obtained with the 2-m telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de San Pedro Mártir (OAN-SPM) on December 16-17, 2009 using the REOSC spectrograph equipped with grism #7 covering the wavelength range 3700-7000 Å. We measured RVs for 23 stars by cross-correlating their spectra against those of template dwarfs observed under similar conditions. Our results show that most of these objects have heliocentric velocities between -40 to -50 km/sec, while only two stars are found outside this interval. These values agree well with previous determinations based on photometric methods. \n \n In addition we derived metallicities [Fe/H] for 14 stars using the calibration of Alonso et al. (1999) . For all but one star our measurements indicate solar or slightly subsolar metallicities ranging from -0.10 dex up to +0.20 dex. Only one object shows an iron abundance significantly higher than solar value (+0.30 dex). \n \n Finally, we compared our results with previously published studies.",
    "We propose an explicit construction for a string model with gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), three generations of quarks and leptons, right-handed neutrinos, and no exotic particles beyond those in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The model is based on type IIA string theory compactified to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold X which has h^{1,1} = 1 and h^{1,2} = 0. We consider a stack of N=2 D6-branes wrapping a divisor S inside X that supports a non-abelian gauge symmetry U(N_c) where N_c = 3. In addition we introduce two sets of fractional branes at singularities of order 6 along divisors T_1 and T_2 such that the total number of D6-branes is 24. By using mirror symmetry arguments it can be shown that this configuration preserves one half of the original supersymmetry.",
    "We present the results of spectral analysis for all Swift bursts with measured redshifts and durations longer than 2 s, using data obtained by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift satellite. We find that most of these bursts are best described as blackbody emission in combination with an additional power-law component at higher energies. The temperature of this blackbody component is found to be correlated with the peak energy of the spectrum E p . This correlation can be explained if we assume that the observed blackbody emission comes from photospheric radius expansion during the prompt phase of the burst. In addition, there seems to exist another correlation between the blackbody temperature T bb , the luminosity L iso and the duration t 90 .\nThe existence of such correlations suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for producing the blackbody emission may also play some role in determining other properties of the bursts. \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRB), discovered more than 40 years ago [1] , have been studied extensively since their discovery [2] . However, many questions about them remain unanswered [3] . One important question concerns the origin of the gamma-rays produced in GRBs [4] . It has been suggested that they could come from internal shocks [5] or magnetic reconnection [6] within relativistic jets launched by collapsing massive stars [7, 8] . Alternatively, it was proposed that they might result from external shocks driven into surrounding medium [9] . Another open issue is whether GRBs are standard candles [10] . If so, then one would expect that different bursts should show similar temporal and spectral behaviors [11] . On the contrary, observations suggest that GRBs exhibit large diversity [12] . Finally, the nature of the progenitors of GRBs remains unknown [13] .",
    "We study numerically and experimentally the dynamics of a liquid droplet bouncing on an inclined plane covered with superhydrophobic coating, which is known to be able to support stable levitation of drops in air.  We show that the lifetimes of such bouncing droplets are determined by their initial kinetic energy. The dependence of the lifetime on this energy can be fitted well using a power law t ~ E0−α where α = 0.5 ± 0.1 for both numerical simulations and experiments. This scaling behavior suggests that the lifetime of a bouncer depends only weakly on its initial velocity. In addition we find that the maximum height reached during each bounce decreases as the number of bounces increases. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be used to estimate the surface tension of water based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have been studied extensively over recent years due to their potential applications in microfluidics [1] . These systems typically consist of millimeter-sized droplets impacting onto hydrophobic surfaces [2] , but they also include smaller droplets bouncing off super-hydrophobic coatings [3] .\nIn many cases it has been observed that the droplets exhibit periodic motion [4] - [6] . However, there exist some examples of non-periodic bouncing [7, 8] or even chaotic trajectories [9] . It was shown recently [10] that the lifetimes (i.e., the times between successive impacts) of bouncing droplets depend strongly on their initial velocities. For example, if the initial speed is too high then the droplet will not bounce at all; instead it will slide down the surface until it reaches the bottom [11] . On the other hand, if the initial speed lies below a certain threshold value then the droplet will bounce indefinitely [12] .",
    "We propose an optical scheme for implementing the Gaussian valence bond (GVB) state, which is one of the most important classes of quantum states in condensed matter physics. The GVB state can be used to describe many-body systems with strong correlations such as spin liquids or Mott insulators. We show that our proposed scheme allows us to distribute entanglement between two distant parties by using only linear optics elements and single-photon sources. Our results may have potential applications in quantum information processing. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields ranging from quantum communication [1] , quantum metrology [2] , quantum sensing [3] , and quantum computing [4] . In particular, it has been shown that quantum entangled states are useful resources for quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , remote state preparation [7] , and quantum key distribution [8] .\n \nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in studying quantum entanglement in many-body systems [9] - [11] . For example, the ground-state wavefunction of strongly correlated fermions on lattices can be written as a product of local singlet pairs known as valence bonds [12] . This class of states is called valence-bond solid (VBS) states [13] . It was later found that VBS states can also be represented by so-called valence bond basis [14] . These states include the famous Néel state [15] describing antiferromagnetic order [16] , the Haldane phase [17] corresponding to integer-spin chains [18] , and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model [19] representing gapped spin-1/2 chain [20] . \n \n Recently, several schemes [21]- [23] were proposed to generate these types of quantum states experimentally. However, all existing proposals require nonlinear interactions among photons [24] and/or complicated setups [25] . Therefore, they cannot be implemented easily in practice. On the other hand, some experimental demonstrations [26] - [28] have been performed recently to produce photonic qubits [29] . Thus, it would be interesting if we could find ways to implement these quantum states without requiring any nonlinear interaction [30] .",
    "We present an analysis of pulsar observations to determine the magnetic field strength in the solar corona at heights between 1 and 3 R_Sun . We use data obtained with the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT) for two different radio frequencies, 327 MHz and 1420 MHz, corresponding to emission heights of about 2 and 5 R_Sun , respectively. The observed pulse profiles are modeled using a simple model that includes contributions from both the local interstellar medium and the solar wind plasma. From these models we derive estimates for the coronal magnetic field strengths as well as the electron density distribution along the line-of-sight towards PSR B1133+16 .\nThe results show that the magnetic field decreases rapidly with height above the photosphere but is still strong enough to confine energetic particles up to several solar radii away from the Sun's surface. This suggests that particle acceleration processes may be taking place throughout most of the solar atmosphere.",
    "The Infrared Camera (IRC), one of the three instruments onboard the Astro-F satellite, is designed to perform imaging observations in four infrared bands centered at 2.4, 3.2, 4.1, and 12 micrometers with high sensitivity over wide fields-of-view ranging from 1 arcmin square to 10 degrees square. The IRC consists of two cameras; an optical camera equipped with a lens system having focal length of f = 50 mm and a near-infrared camera using a lens system with f = 100 mm. Both cameras are cooled down by liquid helium cryostats to temperatures below 5 K. A set of filters covering the entire wavelength range of each band is attached to both cameras. The performance of the IRC has been evaluated through laboratory measurements as well as in-orbit calibration experiments performed during the commissioning phase of the mission. The results show that the IRC meets all its design requirements.",
    "We present new near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy for the high-latitude star forming cloud, CG12. We find that this cloud is composed of two distinct populations; one population with ages <10 Myr and another older population with ages >100 Myr. Using N-body simulations we show that these clouds are likely to be remnants of tidally disrupted open clusters. This suggests that open cluster disruption may play an important role in the formation of isolated young stars at high latitudes. These results have implications on our understanding of how open clusters evolve into open clusters and open clusters into open clusters. Open clusters can also provide insight into the origin of open clusters themselves. In addition, open clusters can help us understand the evolution of open clusters as well as open clusters. Finally, open clusters can give us information about open clusters and open clusters. We use new infrared data obtained by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST).",
    "The electronic properties of solids are determined by their ground and excited state energies, which can be calculated using ab initio wave function-based approaches such as density functional theory (DFT). However, these calculations often suffer from an incomplete description of electron-electron interactions due to the use of approximate exchange-correlation potentials. In this work we present a method that allows us to correct DFT results for excited states with respect to exact many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) results. We apply our approach to calculate the optical absorption spectrum of MgO and compare it to experimental data. Our results show good agreement between experiment and theory over a wide range of photon energies. The presented methodology is applicable to any material where MBPT results exist or can be obtained within reasonable computational effort. This includes most semiconductors but also insulators like ionic compounds. \n \n Ab initio wave-function based methods have become standard tools for calculating the electronic properties of materials. These include ground-state total energy calculations [1], phonon dispersion relations [2], elastic constants [3], magnetic moments [4], and transport coefficients [5]. They are routinely used to predict structural phase transitions [6], defect formation energies [7-9], surface energies [10-12], and chemical reactions [13-15]. Furthermore they provide insight into fundamental physical phenomena including superconductivity [16], magnetism [17], charge-density waves [18], ferroelectricity [19], and quantum critical points [20]. Finally, they allow one to study the effects of external perturbations on the electronic structure [21], e.g., strain [22], pressure [23], electric fields [24], temperature [25], or doping [26].",
    "We present an analytic expression for the one-loop mass-less triangle Feynman integral in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. The results are obtained by using Mellin-Barnes representation and contour integration techniques. We also provide numerical values for some special cases which can be used to check our analytical expressions. This work is motivated by recent interest on the study of higher order corrections to various physical processes, such as Higgs decay into two photons or gluons at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe calculation of loop diagrams plays an important role in theoretical physics. In particular, it has been shown that the inclusion of radiative corrections leads to significant changes in the predictions of many observables [1] . For example, the NLO QCD correction to the decay widths of heavy quarks [2] , top quark pair production [3] , Higgs boson decays [4] etc., have been calculated recently with great success. However, there still remain several open problems related to the evaluation of multi-loop integrals [5] .\nIn this letter we consider the following one-loop mass-less triangle Feyman integral [6] : \nwhere m 1 = m 2 ≡ m 3 ≡ m 4 ≡ 0 and s 12 = q 2 . It should be noted here that I(q 2 ) vanishes when any three masses become equal i.e. m 1 = m 2 = m 3 = m 4 .",
    "We present new exact half-BPS solutions to the low-energy effective action for type-IIB string theory in ten dimensions, which are supported by fluxes on an arbitrary number of intersecting D3-branes. These solutions can be viewed as generalizations of the single Janus solution presented in [1] . We also discuss some properties of these solutions that were not discussed previously. \n \n The first part of this work was published as: \n \n [2] C. A. Johnson et al., Phys. Rev.

    "The effect of magnetic Reynolds number (Rm), Lundquist number (S) and plasma beta (β) on the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence is investigated by means of direct numerical simulations in cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions. The results show that Rm, S and β have significant effects on the saturation level of the Maxwell stress tensor as well as the growth rate of the kinetic energy density. In particular, it was found that for fixed values of other parameters, increasing Rm leads to an increase in both the saturation value of the Maxwell stress tensor and the growth rate of the total kinetic energy density.  Increasing S also increases the saturation value of the stress tensor but has no influence on its growth rate. On the contrary, decreasing β decreases the saturation value of the tensor while having little or no effect on its growth rate. It should be noted that these trends are observed only when the initial equilibrium state satisfies certain constraints which depend on the dimensionless numbers under consideration.",
    "We present the first results for a new template family, called SEOBNRv4HM, which is designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by comparable mass black hole binaries with total masses between 10 and 100 solar masses. We show that this template family can be used in searches for GW signals from binary black holes at current ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo and KAGRA. In addition we demonstrate how these templates are useful for parameter estimation studies using simulated data sets. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on our work.

    "The generalized twistor transform is an extension of the ordinary twistor transform to include particles with spin in arbitrary dimensions. It has been used recently for describing scattering amplitudes involving massive particles as well as massless ones. In this talk I will present some new results on the subject including a description of how one can use it to describe particles beyond free or massless theories. The talk will also cover recent developments related to dualities between different quantum field theories. This includes duality relations that have been found using the generalized twistor transform such as those relating N=4 super Yang-Mills theory to self-dual gravity and its supersymmetric extensions. Finally we will discuss how these ideas are connected to string theory. Generalized twistors were introduced by Witten more than twenty years ago [1] . They provide a powerful tool for studying gauge theories in general relativity [2] , and they play important roles in understanding various aspects of string/M-theory [3] .\nIn particular, the so-called Penrose limit [4] provides a way to relate scattering amplitudes in gauge/gravity theories at weak coupling to correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) at strong coupling [5] . Recently there has been renewed interest in the study of twistors [6] - [11] due to their applications in computing scattering amplitudes [12] - [16] . For example, the tree-level S-matrix elements of gluons [17] and gravitons [18] in four-dimensional N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theory (SYM), which was conjectured to be dual to type-IIB superstrings [19] , were computed via the generalized twistor transform [20] .",
    "In this article, we study cuspidal representations of general linear groups over discrete valuation rings. We prove that if the residue field is infinite and has characteristic zero then any irreducible representation which is unramified outside a finite set of primes is supercuspidal (Theorem 3). This result was previously known only for number fields. As an application, we show how to construct new examples of supercuspidal representations by taking tensor products with characters of tori (Proposition 4).\nWe also give some results on the structure of the space of smooth functions on G(R) where G is a reductive group defined over Q p . In particular, we show that if G = GL n , SL n or Sp 2n then there exists a dense subspace of smooth functions invariant under right translation by elements in G(Q p ) (Corollary 5). Finally, we use these results to compute the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms attached to cuspidal representations of GL 2 (A) (Propositions 6 and 7).",
    "We present the results of our investigation into how stellar evolution models are affected by individual element abundances in stars, focusing on the sensitivity to changes in helium abundance (Y). We use two different sets of evolutionary tracks with varying Y values for masses between 0.8 M⊙ and 8 M⊙ at solar metallicity. The first set is based on the Padova code while the second one uses the Geneva code. For each track we calculate synthetic spectra using the SPECTRUM code. These synthetic spectra are then used as input to determine the best-fit parameters of observed high-resolution optical spectra of Galactic open clusters. Our analysis shows that both codes produce similar results when fitting these cluster data. However, there are significant differences in the derived ages depending on which code was used. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Padova tracks have been calculated without convective overshooting whereas the Geneva tracks include this effect.",
    "We present new results on the detection rate, mass distribution, and orbital properties of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in the Galactic halo based on spectroscopic observations with Keck II/DEIMOS over three years. We find that HVSs are detected at a rate of 0.5 +/- 0.2 per year within 100 pc of the Galactic center. The observed number density profile is consistent with an exponential fall-off with distance from the Galactic center. Our sample contains two HVSs with velocities greater than 1000 km/s; one has a heliocentric radial velocity of 1240 km/s and another has 1420 km/s. These high velocities suggest that these objects were ejected by gravitational slingshots during close encounters between massive black holes or neutron stars. In addition to the known population of HVSs near the Sun, we also detect a large number of high-velocity stars located farther away from the Galactic center which may be associated with other nearby supermassive black holes.",
    "The nucleon is described as an extended object with internal structure, which can be probed by elastic scattering experiments at high energies and small momentum transfers. The present work focuses on the investigation of chiral mechanisms leading to orbital quantum structures within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). In particular we study the role played by pionic degrees of freedom for the description of the nucleon's electromagnetic form factors. We show that the inclusion of explicit pions leads to significant improvements over previous calculations based solely on quark degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the EFT approach allows one to systematically include higher-order corrections into the calculation of observables. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our formalism towards the treatment of other hadronic systems such as nuclei or hypernuclei. The nucleon is described as a composite system consisting of quarks bound together via gluons. However, it has been known since the early days of QCD [1] , that this picture cannot fully explain all experimental observations [2] . For example, while the proton's electric charge radius agrees well with experiment [3] , its magnetic moment turns out to be about 30% larger than expected [4] .\nIn order to resolve these discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data, it was suggested [5] that additional contributions arising from the presence of virtual mesonic fluctuations should be taken into account [6] . These so-called \"meson-cloud\" effects are particularly important when considering processes involving large momentum transfer [7, 8] . It has also been shown [9] that they play an essential role in describing the nucleon's electromagnetic properties [10] .",
    "We study the charge ordering phenomena in one-dimensional solids by using the exact diagonalization method and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique. We find that there are two types of charge orderings, i.e., stripe-like and checkerboard-like orders depending on the electron filling factor n. The former is realized for 0 < n < 1 while the latter appears at half-filling with spin degeneracy lifted. In addition to these ordered states we also observe an exotic state where electrons form pairs without any net charge. This paired state can be regarded as a precursor of superconductivity. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years much attention has been paid to the physics of low dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes [1] , semiconductor nanowires [2] , quantum wires [3] etc.. These materials have attracted considerable interest because they provide us with unique opportunities to explore novel physical properties which cannot exist in conventional three-dimensional bulk materials [4] . For example, it was predicted theoretically [5] and observed experimentally [6] that carbon nanotubes show metallic behavior even though their diameter is comparable or smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another interesting feature of low dimensional systems is that various kinds of electronic phases may appear due to strong correlation effects [7, 8] .\nOne of the most important issues in this field is how to control the electronic phase diagram of low dimensional systems. It should be noted here that the electronic structure strongly depends not only on the geometry but also on the chemical composition [9] . Therefore, if we could change the chemical composition of low dimensional systems, then we would expect new electronic phases to emerge. Recently, several groups succeeded in synthesizing low dimensional compounds whose chemical compositions were controlled precisely [10 -12] . As a result, many fascinating phenomena have been discovered [13 -19] .",
    "We present an optical and infrared study of the central region of the open cluster Sigma Orionis (Orion Nebula Cluster). We have obtained deep JHK photometry with ISAAC at ESO/VLT, as well as X-ray data using XMM-Newton for a sample of stars within a radius of 1 arcmin around the Trapezium OB association. The main results are summarized below:  - A total number of 16 new spectroscopic binaries were found among our targets.  - From the analysis of the radial velocities we find that most of these systems show orbital periods longer than 100 days.  - We also report on the discovery of two new pre-main sequence eclipsing binary candidates.  - In addition to this, we confirm the existence of several known spectroscopic binaries in the field studied here. - Finally, we discuss some interesting cases where the presence of circumstellar disks is inferred by their IR excess emission or by periodic variability.",
    "We present new observations of the outflow driven by the young star cluster NGC 1333 IRAS 4A, located at the center of the Perseus molecular cloud (d = 235 pc). The data were obtained with the Submillimeter Array and include continuum emission at 1.3 mm as well as CO(2-1) line emission. We find that the outflow is highly collimated along an axis oriented NNE-SSW, which coincides with the direction to the nearby Herbig-Haro objects HH 7-11. The total mass of the outflowing gas is estimated to be ~0.1 Msun, while its kinetic energy amounts to ~10^50 ergs. These values are comparable to those found for other low-mass protostellar systems. However, we also detect significant differences between this system and others previously studied. In particular, our results suggest that the outflow may have been triggered recently due to the interaction of the central source with another object or structure within the dense core surrounding it.",
    "We present the results of an investigation into the evolution of dark matter halos and their substructure, using high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions. We find that the number density profiles of subhalos are well described by a power law at all redshifts z < 5 for both low-mass (10^9 Msun/h) and high-mass (10^12 Msun/h) halos. The slope of this profile is independent of halo mass but depends on redshift; it steepens as time progresses. This behavior can be understood if we assume that the subhalo population consists of two components: one which follows the host's potential closely and another whose orbits have been significantly affected by dynamical friction. In addition, we show that the fraction of subhalos within r200c decreases rapidly towards higher masses. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can be used to quantify the effect of numerical resolution on the abundance of subhalos.",
    "We present new observations made with the Cosmosoma experiment, which were designed to search for evidence of an excess in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations above those predicted by standard cosmological models. The data are consistent with predictions based on current theoretical understanding but show some unexpected features that may be related to previously unidentified foreground sources or systematic effects associated with our analysis techniques. \n \n We have used these results to place limits on possible contributions from primordial gravitational waves and other exotic phenomena such as topological defects. These limits are comparable to previous measurements obtained using different experimental approaches. In addition we report the detection of a significant signal at frequencies below 10GHz, which is not expected within conventional cosmological models. This could represent either a new source of foreground contamination or a novel physical effect. Further investigation will require additional experiments to confirm this result and determine its origin. If confirmed it would provide important constraints on theories attempting to explain the observed anisotropy in the CMB spectrum.",
    "In this work, we study the problem of how many users to turn on for multi-antenna broadcast channels (MABCs). We first show that the optimal number of active users is equal to the rank of the channel matrix when all users have the same average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and there are no power constraints at the base station. Then, under general conditions, we prove that the optimal number of users is upper bounded by the minimum between the rank of the channel and the total number of available transmit antennas. Finally, we provide an algorithm which can find the exact solution within polynomial time complexity. The results obtained here may help us design more efficient MABC systems with reduced computational cost. In wireless communications, broadcasting refers to sending information simultaneously to multiple receivers over a shared medium such as radio waves or fiber optics. This type of communication has been widely used in various applications including digital television, video conferencing, data transmission, etc., where it is desirable to send messages to several users simultaneously [1] . However, due to limited resources, only a subset of these users will receive useful signals while others experience interference [2] .\nThe main challenge in designing broadcast systems lies in determining the best set of users who should be turned on so that each user receives its intended message without causing too much interference to other users [3] , i.e., finding the optimal user selection strategy [4] - [6] . For example, if one wants to maximize the sum rate of all users subject to individual power constraints, then the optimal user selection strategy depends not only on the channel state information but also on the power allocation policy [7] . Therefore, the joint optimization of user selection and power control becomes very complicated [8] .",
    "We present an analysis of the Swift/BAT light curve for GRB 060912, which is one of only two bursts to have been classified as both a \"long-soft\" (LS) and a \"short-hard\" (SH) event by the BAT team.  We find that this classification is not robust against changes in the background model used or variations in the time binning applied; we also show that it does not hold up when compared with other LS events observed by Swift. In addition, we demonstrate that the spectral evolution seen during the prompt phase cannot be explained within either the SH or LS models. Finally, we argue that the most likely explanation for these observations is that GRB 060912 was actually a single pulse lasting several hundred seconds, rather than being composed of multiple pulses separated by quiescent intervals. The results presented here suggest that there may exist a continuum of properties between the classes of long-short gamma-ray bursts currently defined by the BAT team.",
    "We present an analysis of the worst-case time complexity for inserting n elements into a binary search tree using the Fibonacci-heap data structure, which is based on the so-called \"Young-Fibonacci insertions\". We show that this algorithm has O(n log n) worst-case running time and thus improves upon previous results by Chan et al., who showed that it takes at least Ω(n2/3) time to perform these operations in the worst case. The main idea behind our proof is to use amortized analysis techniques to bound the number of times we have to update the heap's size during each step of the algorithm. This allows us to prove that the total cost incurred over all steps is bounded by O(n log n). In addition, we also provide experimental evidence showing that our theoretical bounds are tight up to constant factors. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Fibonacci-heap data type was introduced by Fredman and Tarjan [FT86] as part of their work on efficient algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs), shortest paths, and other related problems. It consists of a rooted binary tree with two additional fields associated with every node: its parent pointer and its rank value. Every node stores pointers to its left child and right child nodes; however, unlike ordinary binary trees, there can be more than one node with the same key stored under any given node. Each node maintains a counter called its rank, which indicates how many keys equal to or less than the key of the current node exist below it; if no such key exists then the rank field contains zero. \n \n For example, consider the following Fibonacci-heap storing the values 1 through 5:",
    "We present the results of observations made by the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) in 24 and 70 micron bands toward the Serpens cloud core. The data were obtained as part of the Spitzer Space Telescope's \"Cores to Disks\" Legacy program (c2d). We have detected more than 100 infrared sources within an area of 0.5 square degrees centered on the Serpens South region. Most of these are associated with young stellar objects that show signs of ongoing star formation activity such as outflows or disks. A few dozen sources appear to be background galaxies at redshifts between 1.2 and 3.6. In addition we report the detection of two previously unknown protostars embedded in dense cores located near the center of the Serpens South filamentary structure. These new detections increase our knowledge about the physical conditions prevailing inside this active star-forming complex.",
    "We report on the fabrication and characterization of charge qubits based on self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. We show that by using an optimized growth procedure, we can achieve high quality QD layers with low density of defects which are crucial for achieving good coherence times. The samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy at 600 °C under As-rich conditions to minimize the formation of threading dislocations. A single layer of self-assembled InAs/GaAs QDs was formed after annealing at 650 °C for 10 s followed by deposition of a 50 nm thick Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier layer. Finally, a 20 nm thick GaAs capping layer was deposited. The sample structure is shown schematically in Figure 1 . The photoluminescence spectrum shows emission peaks centered around 1280 nm corresponding to ground state excitonic transitions of individual QDs as well as higher energy states associated with charged excitons.",
    "We investigated the dominant aerosol processes in the atmosphere using ground-based remote sensing and chemical analysis data collected at Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture (Chiba), Japan, between September 2009 and March 2010 under severe air pollution conditions caused by anthropogenic emissions. The results showed that sulfate particles were mainly produced through gas-to-particle conversion via homogeneous nucleation on days with low relative humidity (RH) values; however, they were also formed as secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) when RH was higher than 80%. On some polluted days, SOAs accounted for more than 50% of total submicron particulate matter mass concentrations. In addition to these two major sources, aged sea salt particles contributed significantly to PM2.5 mass concentration levels. We found that SOA formation occurred frequently throughout this study period because of frequent stagnant meteorological conditions. These findings suggest that both primary and secondary aerosol production should be considered simultaneously if we are to accurately assess atmospheric aerosol properties and their effects on human health. \n \n Keywords: Aerosol process, Remote sensing, Chemical composition",
    "We present an analysis of galaxy clusters selected by their red-sequence galaxies (Gladders & Yee 2005) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (DR4). We use two different methods to select cluster candidates, and then apply photometric redshift cuts on these samples to obtain final catalogues with high purity. The first method is based on the matched filter technique developed for X-ray surveys (Postman et al 1996) , while the second one uses a friends-of-friends algorithm applied directly to the galaxy distribution. In order to test our selection algorithms we compare them against mock galaxy clusters extracted from N-body simulations. Our main results are as follows:  1. Using the matched filter technique we find that the number density of galaxy clusters at z < 0.5 is n(z<0.5) = 3.6 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 h3 Mpc-3 . This value agrees well with previous determinations using other techniques.  2. By applying the same matched filter technique to simulated galaxy clusters we show how this method can be used to estimate the mass function of galaxy clusters up to z ~1.0.",
    "We show that the non-Gaussian distributions observed in financial returns are due to microscopic interactions between traders and their environment, which lead to non-trivial correlations among different time scales. We present an analytical model for these correlations based on random matrix theory (RMT), which is able to reproduce all statistical properties of real market data with high accuracy. \n \n The distribution of stock prices has been studied extensively over many decades [1] . It was found that this distribution can be well approximated by a Gaussian function [2] , but deviations have also been reported [3] . In particular, it has been shown recently [4] that the tails of the return distribution follow a power law decay P(r) ~ r−α with α = 3 ± 0.1. This finding contradicts the predictions of standard models such as Black-Scholes [5] or Heston [6] , where the tail exponent should be equal to 2 [7, 8] .\n \nIn order to explain the origin of these deviations we propose here a new approach based on Random Matrix Theory [9] . RMT describes the statistics of complex systems whose dynamics depend on a large number N of degrees of freedom [10] . For example, RMT has successfully been applied to describe the fluctuations of energy levels [11] , wave functions [12] , spin states [13] , quantum transport [14] , and chaotic scattering [15] . Recently, RMT has also been used to study the statistical properties of stock markets [16] - [22] . Here we will focus on the so-called Dyson Brownian motion [23] , which describes the evolution of a system under the influence of white noise.",
    "We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized accretion disks in which we solve the mean-field magnetohydrodynamic equations for an axisymmetric disk with a prescribed radial distribution of angular momentum and mass fluxes, using the shearing-box approximation.  We find that the magnetic field is amplified by differential rotation to produce large-scale poloidal fields whose strength increases outward as $(r^{-3/2})$ (where $r$ is the radius). The toroidal component of the magnetic field also grows rapidly due to winding up of the poloidal field lines by shear flows. As a result, the plasma beta parameter decreases inwardly toward the central object. In addition, we find that the Maxwell stress associated with the magnetic field causes significant redistribution of angular momentum within the disk. This leads to enhanced transport of angular momentum outwards across the disk surface compared to viscous stresses alone.",
    "We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy obtained with Subaru/HDS on day +16 after explosion for the peculiar type Ib supernova SN2006jc, which shows prominent dust formation in its dense shell. The NIR spectrum is dominated by strong P-Cygni profiles of H I Balmer lines and Fe II multiplets at 4233-4245 Å . We find that these features are well reproduced by our non-LTE model calculations assuming an electron density ne = 1 x 10^9 cm-3 , temperature Te = 5500 K , and mass-loss rate oḟ M = 2 x 10^-6 M_sun/yr. In addition to the above mentioned features, we detect weak but significant He II 4686 emission line feature in the red wing of the Hα profile. This suggests that there may be some contribution from helium recombination radiation to the observed fluxes of hydrogenic lines.",
    "The magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat measurements were performed on the single crystals of TbFe3( BO3 )4 . The magnetic properties are analyzed in terms of the crystal-field splitting scheme for Tb3+ ions. It is found that the ground state doublet has an Ising-like anisotropy along c-axis with gz = 8.0 ± 0.1 , which leads to the large spontaneous polarization ( Ps ~ 1μC/cm2 ). The calculated results reproduce well the experimental data except for the low-temperature part of the specific-heat curve below 2 K. This discrepancy may be attributed to the presence of impurities or defects in our samples. \n \n Keywords: Magnetism; Crystal field theory; Specific heat measurement; Susceptibility measurement; Single-crystal growth; Anisotropic magnetoresistance effects; Polarized neutron scattering \n \n \n \n INTRODUCTION : \nTbFe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 belongs to the family of rare-earth iron borates RFe 3 (BO 3 ) (R = Y, Yb, Lu). These compounds have attracted much attention because they exhibit various interesting physical phenomena such as ferroelectricity [1] , multiferroicity [2] , colossal magnetoresistance [3] , and quantum critical behavior [4] .\nIn particular, TbFe 3 (BO 3 )\n4 exhibits a giant spontaneous polarization P s ~ 1 μ C / cm 2 at room temperature [5] due to its unique crystal structure [6] . In this compound, Fe atoms form a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra by sharing their apical oxygen atoms [7 ] . On the other hand, Tb atoms occupy two different sites, i.e., one site surrounded by eight O atoms forming a square antiprismatic coordination polyhedron [8] and another site surrounded by six O atoms forming a trigonal prismatic coordination polyhedron [9] . As shown in Figs. 1 (a) and (b), these two types of polyhedra share common faces perpendicularly to the c -axis [10] .",
    "We prove that for any surface S of general type, the action of its absolute Galois group G(S) on the set of connected components of the modulis space M_g(S) is faithful.  This result has been conjectured by Grothendieck and proved in many cases (e.g., when g = 0 or 1).  We use this to show that if S admits an automorphism of order p > 2 then it also admits one of order q prime to p; we give examples where both orders are arbitrarily large. The proof relies on results about the existence of certain families of curves on S which have been obtained recently using techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory. In particular, we make essential use of the fact that the canonical map of such a curve C onto P^1 is birational; this implies that the image of C under the Albanese map Alb_S : S -> Alb_S(S) is not contained in a fiber of Alb_S.",
    "In this work, we propose an algorithm for blind identification (BI) of distributed antenna systems (DASs). The proposed BI method is based on the joint use of second-order statistics and higher order cumulants to estimate the number of active users in each cell as well as their carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), which are unknown parameters that need to be estimated before data detection can take place. We show by simulation results that our proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of bit error rate performance when CFOs exist between different cells. In addition, it has lower computational complexity than other algorithms. \n \n Keywords: Blind identification; Distributed antenna systems; Second-order statistics; Higher order cumulants; CFO estimation. 1 Introduction \n \n With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, there have been increasing demands for high spectral efficiency and reliable transmission over limited bandwidth resources [1] . To meet these requirements, multi-antenna techniques such as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) [2] , massive MIMO [3] - [5] , cooperative relaying [6] , and cognitive radio [7] have attracted much attention recently. Among them, distributed antenna systems (DAs) [8] - [10] provide significant advantages including improved coverage area, enhanced capacity, reduced power consumption, and increased network flexibility [11] . However, DAs also introduce new challenges due to the fact that they operate under non-coherent conditions [12] . For example, the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side cannot be obtained directly through uplink training or downlink feedback [13] . Therefore, how to obtain CSI accurately becomes one of the most important issues in DA design [14] .\n \nTo address this issue, several works [15] - [17] have investigated the problem of estimating the number of active users and their corresponding channels simultaneously using only statistical properties of received signals without requiring any prior knowledge about the transmitted symbols. These approaches exploit the inherent sparseness property of user activity patterns and utilize second-order statistics (SOS) and/or higher order cumulants (HOCs) [18] - [20] to identify the number of active users per cell. Then, the channel coefficients associated with",
    "The production of light elements in the early universe is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics, cosmology, nuclear physics and particle physics. The standard model (SM) of elementary particles cannot explain how these elements were created during the first few minutes after the Big Bang. In this talk I will present an overview on our current understanding about the origin of light nuclei with A=1-3 produced by photonuclear reactions at high temperatures and densities in the early universe. This includes theoretical predictions for the abundances as well as experimental results obtained using radioactive beams at GSI Darmstadt. Finally, I will discuss possible future experiments to test some of the key predictions made within the SM. Keywords: Photonuclear reaction, Light element synthesis, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical SNe Ia explosion mechanism, Nuclear structure theory. 1 Introduction.\nLight element synthesis in the early universe is among the most challenging open questions in modern science [1] . It has been known since the 1960s that photons can induce nuclear fusion processes leading to the creation of light elements like D, 3 He, 4 He, 7 Li or 9 Be [2] , but it was not until recently when we have gained sufficient knowledge about the physical conditions prevailing in the early universe [3] .\nIn particular, the temperature T and density ρ reached values up to 10 12 K and 10 15 g/cm 3 respectively [4] . These extreme conditions are only accessible today in laboratory experiments using relativistic heavy-ion collisions [5] . However, due to the extremely short time scales involved [6] , such experiments do not allow us to study the formation of light elements directly [7, 8] . Instead they provide information about the properties of hot dense matter which may be relevant for the description of the initial stages of supernova explosions [9] . On the other hand, the abundance pattern observed in primordial objects like white dwarfs [10] or metal-poor stars [11] provides valuable constraints on the models describing the evolution of the chemical composition of the universe [12] .",
    "We report the discovery of an eclipsing binary system HS1857+5144, which is composed of two white dwarfs with masses 0.6 M⊙and 0.8M⊙respectively. The orbital period of this system is 1.5 hours. We find that the mass ratio q = M2/M1=0.84 ±0.04 for this system by using the method of spectral disentangling. This value indicates that it may be in the stage before the final merger into one single degenerate star. In addition to its short orbital period, we also found that the temperature difference between these two components is very large (∼10000K). These results suggest that this system has just evolved out of common envelope phase. \n \n Keywords: Hot subdwarf B stars; Eclipsing; Pre-Cataclysmic Variables; White Dwarfs; Spectral Disentangling",
    "We present an algorithm for the evaluation of Hankel determinants that is almost as efficient as the product formula, but avoids numerical instability problems associated with it.  The determinant of a matrix A = (aij)n×n can be written in terms of its minors as det(A) = ∏i=1^n∑j=0^ni−1j|aij|. We show how to compute this expression efficiently using O((n log n)(log log n)) arithmetic operations and storage space by combining fast polynomial multiplication algorithms with ideas from number theory.   Our approach relies on the fact that we are able to evaluate all minors simultaneously at any point x ∈ [0, 1] using only O((n log n) (log log n))) arithmetic operations and storage space. This allows us to use fast polynomial multiplication techniques to reduce the problem of computing the determinant to one of evaluating polynomials at many points. Finally, we apply recent results from number theory to obtain our final running time bound.",
    "We present an analysis of planet occurrence rates in binary systems, using spectroscopic observations to identify binaries among stars observed by Kepler for which we have obtained high-resolution imaging follow-up. We find that planets are less likely to be found around close visual doubles than single stars (<2 AU), but more likely to be found around wide visual doubles or triples (>20 AU). The difference between these two populations is statistically significant at greater than 3-sigma confidence level. These results suggest that stellar multiplicity may play some role in shaping planetary system architectures. However, our sample size is small compared to other studies, so further investigation will be needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. \n \n Keywords: Binary star - Planets - Multiplicity - Kepler - Visual double - Triple star - Planet formation - Circumstellar disk - Star formation - Exoplanet - Circumbinary disk - Double-lined spectroscopic binary",
    "In this work, we propose an evolutionary neural gas model for input categorization and clustering in the context of self-organizing networks. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept that each neuron can be considered as a cluster center with its own weight vector. In addition to updating their weights according to the standard NG learning rule, neurons are also allowed to evolve by applying genetic operators such as crossover and mutation. We show through experiments conducted on benchmark data sets that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms including SOMs, GNGs, and EBGs. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to solve real-world problems such as text classification and image segmentation. Keywords: Evolutionary Computation, Self-Organizing Networks, Clustering, Genetic Algorithms, Text Classification, Image Segmentation. 1 Introduction Self-organizing maps (SOMs), originally introduced by Kohonen [1] , have been widely applied in many fields ranging from pattern recognition [2] , speech processing [3] , computer vision [4] , bioinformatics [5] , etc.. However, one major drawback of traditional SOMs lies in the fact that they require users to specify the number of clusters beforehand [6] . To overcome this problem, several extensions of SOMs were developed [7, 8] .\nAmong these extensions, growing neural gas (GNG) [9] has attracted much attention due to its ability to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters during training [10] . Nevertheless, it should be noted that most existing models of self organizing network suffer from two main limitations. First, all nodes in the network share the same set of parameters which makes them unable to capture different characteristics of various categories [11] . Second, there lacks any mechanism to prevent overfitting when dealing with high-dimensional data [12] .",
    "We present the results on the spatial distribution of galaxies in the vicinity (<5 Mpc) of a bright quasar at redshift 5.2, using deep near-infrared imaging data taken with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We find that there is an apparent segregation between Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which are selected by their rest-frame UV colors, and Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs). The LBGs show a clear overdensity toward the quasar position while LAEs do not have such a concentration. This result suggests that the physical conditions for star formation may be different between these two populations. \n \n Keywords: galaxy evolution, quasars, clustering, infrared observations, high-z universe, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman alpha emitters \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Quasars play important roles as probes to study the early Universe because they can provide us information about the intergalactic medium through absorption lines observed in their spectra. In addition, quasars themselves emit strong radiation over wide wavelength ranges, so we can use them as background sources to investigate the properties of surrounding objects. For example, it has been suggested that quasars trigger starburst activities in nearby galaxies via intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation and/or gravitational interactions (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006) . \n \n Recently, several studies have investigated the environments of high-redshift quasars based on multi-wavelength surveys. These include optical/near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g., Adelberger & Steidel 2005; Venemans et al. 2007) , radio continuum emission (e.g., Carilli et al. 2007; Overzier et al. 2008 ) and X-ray emission (e.g,. Brandt et al. 2002; Gilli et al. 2003 ) . However, most previous works focused only on relatively small scales (<1 Mpc) due to limited angular resolution or sensitivity of telescopes used. On larger scales, some authors reported possible evidence for large-scale structures associated with quasars (e.g., Kurk et al. 2000; Pentericci et al",
    "We present new observations of the outflows driven by massive protostars using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3 mm, which are compared with previous results obtained with single-dish telescopes. We find that the SMA data reveal more compact structures than those seen previously; this is likely due to missing flux and/or resolution effects. The total mass loss rates inferred for these sources range between 10^-4 and 10^-3 Msun/yr, while their momentum flux ranges between 10^-2 and 10^1 Lsun/c/s. These values are similar to those found for low-mass Class 0 objects but higher than expected if scaled up according to the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that there may be additional mechanisms driving the outflows besides radiation pressure on dust grains. \n \n In addition we report the detection of infalling gas toward two of our targets. For G35.20-1.74NW, we detect an inward motion of ~0.5 km/s over a distance of ~1000 AU. For IRAS 18162-2048, we see evidence for both inward motions as well as outward motions along different lines-of-sight.",
    "We study satellites in simulated galaxies with different masses at z = 0 using high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (the Millennium Run). We find that there is no significant difference between the number density profiles of satellite galaxies around central galaxies with different luminosities or halo masses. The radial distribution of satellites shows an excess over the predictions based on the subhalo abundance matching technique for r < 30 kpc/h. This excess can be explained by tidal stripping of satellites before they are accreted onto the main galaxy. In addition, we show that the fraction of surviving satellites decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the center of host halos. Finally, we investigate how the properties of satellites depend on those of their hosts. Our results suggest that the majority of faint satellites may have been destroyed through mergers and/or tidal disruption during infall into larger systems. These findings provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation.",
    "We report on an analysis of archival Chandra data for the central region of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 (NGC 3034). We find that there are two bright, point-like sources in this field which have been previously identified as ULXs (Ultra-Luminous X-Ray Sources) by Swartz et al. (2004) . The first source is located at RA = 12 h 54 m 55 s .6 and Dec = 69°59'45'' with a count rate of 1.1 x 10^-3 counts sec-1. This source has a luminosity of 2 x 10^39 erg/sec assuming it lies at 8 kpc distance. The second source is located at RA=12h54m55s.7 and Dec=69°59'46'' with a count rate 0.9 x 10^-3 countssec-1. It also has a luminosity of about 2 x 10^39erg/sec if it lies at 8kpc. Both these sources appear to be variable over timescales ranging between hours and days.  These results suggest that both sources may contain black holes accreting close to their Eddington limit.",
    "We report on the observation and characterization of two-dimensional defect modes in optically-induced photonic crystals (OIPCs). The OIPC is formed by periodic modulation of refractive index using femtosecond laser pulses focused into fused silica glass. We show that the defect mode can be tuned over a wide range of wavelengths, which are determined by the periodicity of the lattice structure as well as the size of the defects. This work opens up new possibilities for designing optical devices based on these structures. \n \n Photonic crystal slabs have attracted considerable attention recently because they provide an excellent platform to study light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [1] . In particular, it has been shown that three-dimensional photonic crystals with point or line defects exhibit localized states within their bandgap [2] , leading to many interesting applications such as lasers [3] , filters [4] , sensors [5] , nonlinear optics [6] , etc.. However, fabrication of three-dimensional photonic crystals requires sophisticated techniques [7, 8] , making them difficult to integrate with other micro/nano-structures. Recently, several groups have demonstrated two-dimensional photonic crystals [9] - [11] fabricated directly inside transparent materials via direct laser writing [12] - [14] . These 2D photonic crystals offer advantages including ease of fabrication, flexibility in design, and compatibility with existing technologies [15] .\nIn this Letter we demonstrate the formation of defect modes in opticallyinduced photonic crystals (OPC) [16] . The OPC consists of periodically modulated refractive index created by focusing femtosecond laser pulses into fused silica glass [17] . By introducing defects into the lattice structure, we observe localized defect modes within the stopband of the OPC. Furthermore, we show that the defect mode wavelength can be continuously tuned across the entire stopband simply by changing the lattice spacing and/or the size of the defects. \nThe experimental setup used to create the OPC is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1(a) . A Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier system operating at 800 nm was employed to generate 100 fs duration pulses at a repetition rate of 1 kHz.

    "We present an analytic solution to the steady state distribution for the mechanistic home-range model developed by Moorcroft et al. (2006) that allows for efficient computation of home ranges using numerical integration methods. The new method is implemented as part of the R package adehabitatHR, which also includes functions for computing home ranges with the original algorithm (i.e., without the analytical solution). We demonstrate how our approach can be used to rapidly compute home ranges across large landscapes containing thousands of habitat patches. Our results show that the new method produces identical estimates compared to those obtained with the original algorithm but requires less computational time when estimating home ranges over large spatial extents. Analytical solutions are useful because they allow researchers to efficiently estimate home ranges on very large datasets or at fine resolutions. \n \n Home ranges have been widely studied since their introduction into ecology more than 50 years ago [1] . These areas represent the area within which individuals obtain all necessary resources [2] , such as food [3] , water [4] , shelter [5] , mates [6] , and cover [7] . In addition to being important for understanding animal behavior [8] , home ranges play key roles in conservation biology [9] , wildlife management [10] , epidemiology [11] , and disease transmission [12] .\n \nHome-range models typically assume that animals move through a landscape composed of discrete habitat patches [13] . Animals select among these patches based on some combination of patch attributes [14] , including resource availability [15] , vegetation structure [16] , predation risk [17] , and conspecific density [18] . This process continues until the animal reaches equilibrium between its movement rate and the quality of available habitats [19] . \n \n A number of different approaches exist for modeling animal movements [20] . One popular class of models uses random-walk theory [21] to describe animal movements [22] . Random walk models assume that animals make independent decisions about where to go next [23] . However, this assumption may not always hold true [24] . For example, if two neighboring patches contain similar levels of resources [25] , then it would be unlikely for an animal to switch back-and-forth between them [26] . To account for this type of behavioral response, Moorcro",
    "Reverberation is an important feature of brain function, but its role remains unclear. We show that reverberation can be generated by the interplay between calcium signaling and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to bursts of spikes which are followed by periods of low firing rate due to depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. The resulting slow recovery of transmitter release causes a build-up of residual calcium concentration [Ca] res , leading to facilitation of glutamate release during subsequent bursts. This positive feedback loop generates sustained reverberatory activity with multiple time scales. Our results suggest that reverberation may play a key role in information processing within neural circuits. Reverberation is one of the most prominent features of brain function [1] . It has been observed across different species [2] - [4] as well as in various brain areas including hippocampus [5] , neocortex [6] , thalamus [7] , striatum [8] , cerebellar cortex [9] , olfactory bulb [10] , and retina [11] .\nDespite its ubiquity, however, it still remains unknown what functional roles reverberation plays in the brain [12] . One possibility is that reverberation serves as a mechanism for memory storage [13] or retrieval [14] . Another hypothesis suggests that reverberation could serve as a substrate for working memory [15] . Yet another idea is that reverberation might provide a means for temporal coding [16] . Finally, some studies have suggested that reverberation may simply reflect ongoing spontaneous activity [17] .",
    "We present the first results for atmospheric dynamics in short period extra-solar gas giant planets (EGPs) using 3D general circulation models with radiative transfer and realistic opacities. We find that the night-side temperature is strongly dependent on opacity, which determines how much energy can be transported to space by radiation. The day-night contrast increases as we decrease the opacity because less heat escapes through the nightside atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower pressures where convection becomes inefficient. For low enough opacities, the planet cools down completely during its orbit resulting in an extremely cold night side. Our simulations show that EGPs are likely to have very different climates depending on their composition.

    "We present an analysis of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) selected by narrowband imaging with Subaru/Suprime-Cam and spectroscopic follow-up observations using VLT/VIMOS at z ~ 3.1, which is one of the most active epochs for galaxy formation. We find that LAEs are distributed over a wide range of environments; they exist both in isolated regions as well as in dense clusters. The clustering properties of LAEs depend on their luminosities. In particular, we found that bright LAEs show stronger clustering than faint ones do. This result suggests that bright LAEs may be more evolved systems compared to fainter ones. Furthermore, we investigated the dependence of clustering strength on the equivalent widths of Lyman-alpha emission lines. Our results suggest that strong clustering objects tend to have higher equivalent widths. These findings imply that there exists some evolutionary link between LAEs and LBGs. \n \n Keywords: Lyman alpha emitter",
    "We report on the room-temperature ferromagnetism in Mn-doped ZnO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The Curie temperatures are found to be around 300 K for all samples with different doping levels, which is much higher than that reported previously. We also find that the magnetization increases linearly as the applied field decreases and shows hysteresis loops at low fields. These results indicate that the observed ferromagnetic behavior may originate from exchange coupling between localized spins rather than intrinsic ferromagnetism. \n \n In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new materials for spintronic applications such as nonvolatile memory devices or logic circuits based on the manipulation of electron spins instead of charge carriers1-5 . Among these materials, diluted magnetic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention because they can combine both electronic and magnetic functionalities into one material6-8 .\n \n\n\nZnO-based DMSs have been extensively studied due to their wide band gap energy (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV)9 , high transparency10-12 , and good chemical stability13-15 . However, it remains challenging to achieve room-temperature ferromagnetically ordered states in ZnO-based DMSs16-18 . Although several groups have recently demonstrated room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in various types of ZnO-based DMS systems19-24 , most of them show relatively small saturation magnetizations25-27 . \n \n Here we report on the observation of room-temperature ferromagnetisms in Mn-doped ZnObased DMSs prepared using pulsed laser deposition28-30 .

    "We present the light-cone distribution amplitudes (DAs) for axial vector mesons in terms of their helicity components, which are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with an instantaneous interaction kernel and applying the method developed recently to calculate DAs.  We find that the twist-2 DA is dominated by its first Gegenbauer moment, while higher moments contribute significantly only at large momentum fractions x > 0.7. The twist-3 DA has two independent functions, one of them being proportional to the second Gegenbauer moment. Our results show that the twist-4 contribution is negligible compared to those of lower twists. These findings will be useful for studying exclusive processes involving axial vector mesons such as B-decays into charmonium plus photon or pion pair. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe study of hadronic structure plays an important role in understanding strong interactions between quarks and gluons inside hadrons. In particular, the investigation on the parton distributions provides us valuable information about how quarks and gluon are distributed within hadrons [1] . Recently, there have been great interests in exploring the internal structures of hadrons beyond the leading-twist level [2] , especially the transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions [3] .\nIn this work we focus our attention on another type of nonperturbative objects -the light-cone distribution amplitudes(DAs). They describe the probability amplitude of finding a quark-antiquark pair with certain longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse separation at some fixed light-like distance [4] . It was shown that they play crucial roles in describing various hard exclusive reactions [5] . For example, the decay constants fBπ and fBs can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs [6] ; the form factors of semileptonic decays B→πlν l and B→Klν l depend on both the lowest-and next-to-lowest order DAs [7, 8] . Furthermore, it was found that the heavy-to-light transition form factor FV(q 2 ) of B→V transitions depends",
    "We present an analysis of the mass function (MF) of active black holes (BHs), based on the sample of quasars with redshifts z < 0.5 and luminosities L > 10^44 erg/s, selected by Shen et al. (2007). We use two different methods to estimate BH masses for this sample - virial method and continuum-fitting method. The MF is constructed using both these estimates separately as well as their combination. Our results are compared against previous studies which used similar samples but different techniques to determine BH masses. We find that our best fit Schechter parameters agree within errors with those obtained previously. However, we also find evidence for a possible excess at low-mass end when we combine all three data sets together. This excess could be due to incompleteness or biases in the selection criteria adopted here. In addition, we compare our results with theoretical predictions made by Hopkins et al. (2006a) and Shankar et al. (2009b) .",
    "The author considers the problem of gravitational interaction between bodies in terms of their informational content. The main idea is that the gravitational field can be considered as an ensemble of gravitons which carry information about the source body. Gravitational waves are treated as carriers of information on the state of motion of gravitating objects. It is shown how this approach allows one to explain some phenomena observed in astrophysics (the Pioneer anomaly) and cosmology (dark energy). In addition, it is proposed to use the concept of \"information potential\" for describing the evolution of the universe. This article was published by the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity Volume 27, Issue 14, pages 5993-6010, November 2010. DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/27/14/05993/abstract. The following text is taken directly from the original publication. \n \n Abstract \n \n We consider the problem of gravitational interaction among bodies in terms of their information content. The main idea here is that the gravitational field may be viewed as an ensemble of gravitons/quanta carrying information about the source body; gravitational waves are then seen as carriers of information regarding the state of motion of the gravitating objects. This viewpoint enables us to provide explanations for certain phenomena observed in astrophysical settings (e.g., the Pioneer anomaly), as well as in cosmological contexts (e.g., dark energy). Moreover, we propose using the notion of “information potential” to describe the evolution of the Universe.",
    "We propose that the metallic enhancement observed for some post T Tauri stars (PTTS) may be due to an accretion of planetesimals during their formation phase, which is followed by rapid planet formation and subsequent ejection of planets into space.  We show that this scenario can explain both the high metallicity found among PTTS as well as the low abundance ratios between refractory elements such as Mg/Si or Al/Si compared with those expected if these objects formed through standard core-accretion processes. The proposed mechanism also explains why there are no known close-in giant planets around PTTSs despite the fact that they have already passed their protoplanetary disk stage. This model predicts that most PTTS should host at least one Jupiter mass planet on wide orbits beyond 1 AU. In addition we predict that many PTTS will exhibit infrared excesses caused by dusty debris disks produced by collisions between planetary bodies.",
    "We present the first mid-infrared phase curve observations for an extrasolar planet, WASP-121b (1SWASP J140747.93-394542.7), using Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The data were taken in two epochs separated by one year to allow us to search for any changes in the system's properties over time. We find that the amplitude of the phase variation is consistent with previous measurements made in the optical but we detect no significant change between our two epochs. This suggests that there are no large variations in the temperature structure or composition of this planet as it orbits its host star. Our results also show that the planet has a very high albedo in both bands which may be due to clouds and/or haze. These findings have important implications for understanding how planets form and evolve. \n \n Keywords: exoplanet, infrared",

The results are compared to previous observations made by Copernicus and IUE satellites as well as FUSE. We find that our values for N(3 He+)/N(H+), which range between 0.0015-0.0125, agree within uncertainties with those measured previously at high latitudes but disagree significantly with lower latitude measurements. Our results suggest that there is an additional source of ionization near the Galactic plane not accounted for by cosmic rays or X-rays. This could be due to shocks driven into the interstellar medium by supernovae remnants and/or winds associated with massive OB associations. \n \n Keywords: Helium abundance, Interstellar medium, Shocks, Supernova remnant, Winds, Cosmic ray",
    "We study adiabatic charge transport across an interacting quantum dot coupled to two leads, where one lead is driven by a time-dependent gate voltage and the other remains grounded. We show that this setup can be used as a pump for electrons when the driving frequency matches twice the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states of the dot. In particular we find that the pump current exhibits sharp peaks whenever the Fermi level crosses a bound state inside the gap induced by the Coulomb interaction on the dot. The height of these peaks increases with increasing temperature T , which allows us to use our system as a thermometer. Finally, we discuss how our findings are modified if the driving amplitude becomes comparable or larger than the charging energy U . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in using periodically-driven systems as sources of coherent radiation [1] . This idea was first proposed more than twenty years ago [2] but only recently it became possible to realize such devices experimentally [3] .\nOne particularly interesting class of periodically-driven systems consists of those whose properties depend strongly on their internal degrees of freedom [4] . These so-called \"quantum impurity models\" have attracted considerable attention over the past few decades because they provide a simple description of many physical phenomena ranging from single-electron transistors [5] to heavy fermion compounds [6] . Recently, several groups have studied theoretically the possibility of using quantum dots [7, 8] and carbon nanotubes [9] as pumps for electrons [10] . However, most theoretical studies so far focused on non-interacting particles [11] while experiments typically involve strong interactions [12] . It would therefore be desirable to extend existing theories beyond the weak-coupling limit [13] .\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of electron correlations on the performance of a pump based on a quantum dot (QD) [14] . To do so, we consider a QD connected to two leads via tunnel barriers [15] . One lead is driven out of equilibrium by applying a periodic gate voltage V g (t), whereas the second lead serves as a reference electrode [16] . As shown schematically in Fig. 1(",
    "We study the effect of cascades initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in intergalactic space, and their contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray emission observed at Earth. We find that cascade photons can be produced over cosmological distances with energies up to 10 TeV or more. The resulting flux is strongly suppressed for sources located beyond redshifts z > 0.5 due to absorption effects caused by pair production interactions between cascade photons and infrared radiation fields associated with galaxies. For nearby source models we show that this suppression leads to an upper limit on the photon fraction fγ < 10% − 20% depending on the UHECR injection spectrum assumed. This constraint is consistent with current measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray background as well as recent results obtained using Fermi/LAT data. In addition, our analysis shows that cascade photons are likely to dominate the total diffuse gammaray emission below 1 GeV if they originate within a distance of about 100 Mpc around us.",
    "We present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found [1-3]. Even today there exist many open questions about black holes [4] . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",
    "We study the statistical properties of Barkhausen noise generated by an Ising spin system with random fields and competing interactions at its surface, using wavelets to analyze the time series produced by this model.  We find that the power spectrum of the Barkhausen signal is well described by a stretched exponential function over several decades in frequency space. The stretching exponent depends on both temperature T and magnetic field H. In particular, we show how the stretching exponent can be used as a measure of the degree of disorder in the sample under investigation. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work to other types of systems exhibiting avalanche dynamics. Barkhausen noise (BN) has been studied extensively since it was first observed experimentally more than 100 years ago [1] . It consists of bursts of magnetization reversals which occur when a ferromagnetic material is driven through successive metastable states [2] , and is believed to play an important role in determining the coercive force of such materials [3] .\nThe statistics of BN have attracted considerable interest recently [4] - [8] due to their potential application in non-destructive testing [9] . However, despite many experimental studies [10] - [12] there are still open questions about the origin of these fluctuations [13] . For example, while some authors claim that they arise from thermally activated processes [14] others argue that they result from collective effects [15] or even quantum tunneling [16] . A number of theoretical models [17] - [20] have also been proposed to explain the physics behind BN but none of them seems able to reproduce all features simultaneously [21] .",
    "We present new results on the asteroseismic analysis of the primary component in the binary system Alpha Centari, based on data obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory (Chile). We find evidence for two independent frequencies that are likely to be associated with rotationally split modes. The observed frequency pattern is consistent with theoretical predictions and suggests an inclination angle between 40°and 60°for this star. \n \n Keywords: Asteroseismology, Rotation, Binary stars, Oscillations, Frequency analysis, High-precision radial velocities, Alpha Centari ABSTRACT \n \n We report new results on the asterioseismic analysis of the main-sequence F-type star Alpha Centari A, which forms part of a close double system with its cooler companion B. Our study was carried out using high-precision radial-velocity measurements collected over more than four years by the HARPS instrument installed at ESO's 3.6-m telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chilean Andes), together with photometric observations made simultaneously with the CoRoT space mission. By applying standard techniques used in asteroseismology we have detected several periodicities in both datasets, including one signal whose periodicity corresponds exactly to the orbital period of the system. This finding confirms previous suggestions that the pulsational behaviour of this star may be influenced by tidal effects induced by its companion. In addition, our analysis reveals another set of signals corresponding to periods ranging from about 1 day up to almost 2 days. These signals can be explained as being due to rotationally split p-mode oscillations excited in the convective envelope of the star. Their presence provides strong support for the hypothesis that the surface of Alpha Centari A has been shaped by magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes operating within the convection zone.",
    "We present simultaneous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional Counter Array, Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), X-Ray Telescope (XRT), Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT), and Radio Extension for Multi-wavelengths Observatory (REM). The data were obtained during an active state of the source on February 18-20, 2005 . We find that the spectral energy distribution is consistent with synchrotron self-Compton emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection events occurring within the jet. This interpretation is supported by the detection of rapid variability at all wavelengths observed simultaneously. In addition to this flaring activity we also detect significant flux variations over longer timescales which are likely due to changes in the Doppler boosting factor caused by bulk motion of plasma along the jet. These results demonstrate how multi-wavelength campaigns can be used to study the physical processes responsible for the production of non-thermal radiation in AGN jets.",
    "Quantum repeaters are proposed to overcome the loss in quantum communication channels by using entangled photons and linear optics elements such as beam splitters, phase shifters, and single-photon detectors.  In this work we present an experimental demonstration of a quantum repeater with two distant nodes connected via a 50 km fiber link. The system consists of three parts: (1) generation, (2) transmission, and (3) detection of photon pairs at each node; (4) Bell-state measurement between the two nodes; and (5) feed-forward operation on the received qubits based on the result of Bell-state measurement. We have successfully demonstrated all these parts except the feed-forward operation which is currently under development. Our results show that our current setup can generate high quality entanglement over a distance up to 50 km. This experiment paves the way towards practical implementation of quantum networks. Quantum repeaters are proposed to solve the problem caused by channel losses in quantum communication systems [1] . They use entangled photons generated locally or remotely [2] , and linear optical elements such as beam splitters; phase shifters; and single-photon detectors [3] .\nIn this Letter, we report an experimental demonstration of a long-distance quantum repeater [4] consisting of four main components: (1) generation, ( 2 ) t r ansmission , ( 3 ) d etection , and ( 4 ) B ell -state m easurement o f pho ton pairs at eac h n ode ; ( 5 ) feed-foward operations on the received qubits according to the outcome of Bell-state measurements [ Figs. 1(a) , 1(b), and 2]. A pair of polarization-entangled photons was produced through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). One photon acted as signal while another one served as idler. After passing through different paths, they were combined together at a beam splitter (BS) and sent into a 50-km-long fiber-optic line. At both ends of the fiber-optic line, photon-number resolving avalanche photodiodes (APDs) detected the",
    "We study the elasticity of thin films with periodic microstructure, which are constrained to lie on an underlying substrate. We show that such systems can exhibit anomalously large values for their Young's moduli as well as Poisson ratios. The origin of these effects is traced back to the presence of phonon soft modes associated with the periodicity along the film normal direction. These results have implications for the design of novel materials with tailored elastic properties. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how confinement affects the physical behavior of matter at the nanoscale [1] . This problem arises naturally when considering thin films or nanowires embedded within bulk materials; however it also applies more generally whenever a system is restricted to occupy only part of its available phase space [2] . For example, this situation occurs frequently during crystal growth where defects may be introduced into the lattice structure by impurities [3] , or when studying colloidal suspensions [4] .\n \nIn this work we consider the case of a thin film with periodic microstructure, whose thickness h lies between two length scales L and d (see Fig 1) . Here L represents the typical size of the unit cell while d denotes the characteristic spacing between adjacent layers; both quantities are assumed to be much smaller than the in-plane dimensions of the sample. Such structures arise commonly in nature, e.g., in layered compounds like graphite [5] , transition metal dichalcogenides [6] , and hexagonal boron nitride [7] . They are also used extensively in technological applications ranging from photovoltaics [8] to optoelectronics [9] . \n \n Figure 1: Schematic illustration of our model geometry.

    "In this talk, we will discuss the relationship between loop spaces and Langlands parameters in terms of their connections to representation theory.  We will begin by recalling some basic facts about loop spaces and their relation with infinite-dimensional Lie groups (e.g., loop groups).  Next, we'll recall how one can associate a certain type of infinite-dimensional Lie group called an affine Hecke algebra to any reductive algebraic group over a field k of characteristic 0.   Finally, we'll explain how these two ideas are related via the notion of a Harish-Chandra bimodule. The main result is that if G is a connected semisimple complex algebraic group defined over Q then there exists a natural isomorphism between the category of finite-dimensional representations of G(Q) and the category of Harish-Chandra modules for its associated affine Hecke algebra. This work was done jointly with David Vogan at Harvard University during my postdoctoral fellowship.",
    "The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is one of two instruments aboard NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in June 2008. The LAT consists of an array of silicon strip trackers and cesium iodide calorimeters that detect gamma rays with energies between 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. This document describes a novel method used by the LAT collaboration to monitor the performance of its detector system during flight using cosmic ray data taken over several months prior to launch. We show how this method can be applied to characterize the response function of each individual tracker module as well as the overall energy resolution of the entire LAT. These results are compared against ground calibration measurements performed before launch. Finally we demonstrate how these techniques have been successfully employed to identify problems with some modules after launch which were subsequently fixed through software updates. The Large Area Telescope (L AT ) is one of two instruments flown on NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope [1] . Launched into space in June 2008, it has detected thousands of sources of high-energy photons since then [2] .\nIn order to perform such observations, the L AT must accurately measure the direction and energy of incoming photons. To accomplish this task, the L AT uses a combination of silicon strip detectors and CsI(Tl) scintillators arranged in four layers around a central tungsten converter foil [3] , see Figure 1 . Each layer contains 16 towers, or \"trajectory segments\", consisting of 4 silicon strips oriented at different angles relative to the incident photon trajectory [4] . In addition there are 8 \"strips\" per tower located behind the silicon sensors but outside of the active volume of the calorimeter [5] . Together they form a total of 56 independent tracking channels [6] .",
    "We propose that the energy release process in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is due to two different physical mechanisms, magnetic reconnection and catastrophic loss of equilibrium driven by ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities.  The first mechanism releases free magnetic energy stored in the corona into kinetic energy of plasma flows during solar eruptive events such as flares or CMEs. This mechanism has been studied extensively using numerical simulations based on resistive MHD models with various levels of complexity ranging from simple two-dimensional configurations to more realistic three-dimensional ones. In this work we focus our attention on the second mechanism which involves rapid conversion of magnetic field energy into thermal energy through an explosive reconfiguration of the magnetic topology. We show how this mechanism can be modeled analytically within the framework of ideal MHD theory. Our results suggest that both processes are likely to operate simultaneously but at different stages of evolution of the erupting flux rope.",
    "In this article we study the structure of smooth foliations on closed manifolds, which are given by submersions whose fibers have only Morse singularities (i.e., they look like graphs over their tangent spaces). We prove that such foliations can be approximated in the C 1 -topology by regular ones and give an explicit bound for the approximation error. This result is used to show that any leafwise Riemannian metric on these foliations has bounded geometry. The main tool here is the theory of harmonic maps into Hilbert spaces developed by Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin. In particular, we use the fact that every harmonic map into a Hilbert space is weakly conformal. As another application of our results, we obtain some estimates for the volume growth rate along leaves of such foliations. Finally, using the above mentioned bounds for the approximation error, we also get lower bounds for the number of critical points of generic functions on closed manifolds.",

    "The origin of the most massive stars is still an open question in astrophysics, as well as their role in shaping galactic evolution. In this talk I will present recent results on how we can use observations to constrain theoretical models for the formation of these objects.  The first part of my talk will focus on the observational properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) that are found at high redshift z>6-7. These YMCs have masses up to 10^8 Msun and sizes of ~1kpc. They appear to be very compact compared with local starburst galaxies such as Arp 220 or M82 which typically contain much less dense stellar populations. We find that the observed size-mass relation of these distant YMCs agrees remarkably well with predictions based on numerical simulations of turbulent gas clouds collapsing under self-gravity. This suggests that turbulence plays an important role during the early stages of cluster formation. However, it remains unclear whether all massive stars form in such large clusters like those seen at high redshifts.",
    "We report on the optical and near-infrared afterglows of the short-hard burst GRB 050802 detected by Swift/BAT on May 2nd, 2005 at 07:55:06 UT (T0). The prompt emission was followed by an X-ray flare peaking at T0+500 s in the rest frame. We find that both components are well described by power laws with decay indices α1 = 1.2 ± 0.3 for t < 10 ks and α2 = 2.5 ± 0.4 for t > 10 ks. A break is observed between these two regimes around t0 + 20 ks. No evidence for spectral evolution or extinction has been found within each component. Our results suggest that this event may be similar to GRB 021004 which also showed a double-power law behaviour but without any significant spectral evolution across the break time. This suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for the late-time steepening could be related to the one producing the early shallow decline. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst",
    "We present the results of a numerical study on the relaxation dynamics of an initially straight contact line in a two-dimensional geometry, which is driven by surface tension and viscous dissipation at the moving interface between liquid and gas phases.  We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with free-slip boundary conditions using a spectral element method to simulate the flow field around the evolving droplet shape. The initial condition consists of a circular droplet sitting on top of a flat substrate that has been perturbed slightly away from its equilibrium position. As time evolves, we observe the formation of capillary waves along the contact line as well as the development of small satellite drops near the main droplet due to pinching off events. In addition, we find that the contact angle decreases continuously during this process until it reaches zero degrees when the entire droplet detaches from the substrate. Finally, we compare our simulation results against experimental data obtained from high-speed video microscopy measurements performed by other researchers.",
    "We study the effect of rounding on the dynamics of complex networks with first-order phase transition (FPT). We show that FPTs can be rounded by adding or removing nodes, which leads to an increase in the number of cooperators at equilibrium. The results are obtained for both static and dynamic models of evolution of cooperation. In particular, we find that the presence of FPTs is necessary but not sufficient condition for high levels of cooperation. Finally, we propose a simple strategy for finding the best possible roundings leading to maximal level of cooperation. Rounding of first-order phase transistions and optimal cooperation in scale free networks. P. Krawczyk 1 , A. Szolnoki 2 . \n1 Institute of Physics, University of Warsaw, Poland; krawczykp@wip.waw.pl .\n2 Department of Mathematics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; aszolnok@wip. waw.pl .\nIn this work we investigate how the presence of first order phase transitions affects the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. First, we introduce two new concepts -the minimal and the maximal cooperative states-which describe the range of values of parameters where cooperation prevails over defection. Then, using these definitions, we prove that any system with first order phase transition has its own unique value of parameter corresponding to the maximum fraction of cooperators. Next, we consider the problem of optimizing cooperation in such systems. To do so, we define the concept of \"rounding\" of first order phase transitions, i.e., changing their shape into smooth curves without affecting the position of the point of maximum fraction of cooperators within the interval [0, 1]. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the rounding procedure increases the fraction of cooperators at equilibrium in all studied cases. Finally, we present a method allowing one to determine the optimal rounding of given phase transition curve.",
    "We study the fractal dimension of domain walls (DWs) in two dimensional Ising spin glasses with nearest neighbor interactions and random bonds using Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures. We find that DWs are fractals for all values of temperature studied here, i.e., T = 0.5J/kB to 1.2J/kB where J is the strength of interaction between spins on neighboring sites.  The fractal dimensions obtained by box counting method agree well with those determined by the correlation function analysis. In addition we show that the fractal dimension decreases as the temperature increases. This result suggests that the structure of DWs becomes more complicated when the system approaches its critical point. Finally it should be noted that our results can also be applied to other systems such as vortex lines in type-II superconductors or dislocation networks in crystals. Two-dimensional Ising spin glasses have been extensively investigated both experimentally [1] and theoretically [2] . It has been shown that these models exhibit many interesting phenomena including phase transitions [3] , spin-glass states [4] , and glassy dynamics [5] .\nIn this work we focus on one particular aspect of the model which is the fractal nature of domain walls [6] . Domain wall refers to an interface separating different ordered phases [7, 8] . For example, in ferromagnetic materials there exist two types of domains; up and down magnetization [9] . These domains are separated by interfaces called domain walls [10] . Similarly, in antiferromagnets [11] , there exists four possible orientations of magnetic moments [12] ; three of them form triangular sublattices while the fourth forms a square lattice [13] . Therefore, there will be six types of domain walls [14] .",
    "We present new HST photometric data on halo stars in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3377, obtained with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The observations were made as part of program GO-8491 and consist of two exposures taken through the F606W filter at different roll angles to allow for proper sky subtraction. We have used these images to measure magnitudes for more than 1000 candidate red giant branch (RGB) stars within an area of 1 arcmin radius centered around the galaxy's center. These measurements are compared to those derived by Kundu & Whitmore (1998) , who observed this same field using ground-based telescopes. Our results show good agreement between our photometry and that presented previously; however we find evidence for systematic differences which may be due to crowding effects or calibration uncertainties. \n \n Keywords: Red Giant Branch, Galaxy, WFPC2",
    "We prove that there exists an open set of initial data such that the corresponding solution to the rapidly rotating shallow water (RSW) or Euler equations is globally smooth in space-time, provided it stays sufficiently close to some equilibrium state. The proof relies on a combination of energy estimates with suitable weighted Sobolev inequalities. We also show how our results can be extended to more general systems of conservation laws which are not necessarily strictly hyperbolic. In particular we consider the case where one of the characteristic speeds vanishes at a point but remains bounded away from zero elsewhere. \nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this work is twofold. First, we establish global regularity properties for the rapidly rotating shallow water system and its generalization to arbitrary dimension.

    "We present an analysis of chemical equilibrium and disequilibrium processes occurring in the atmospheres of substellar mass objects (SMBOs). We have developed a new method for calculating departures from chemical equilibrium, which is based on the assumption that all species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with each other at any given point within the atmosphere. This approach allows us to calculate the abundances of individual molecular species as functions of altitude above the photosphere. The results show that there can be significant deviations from chemical equilibrium even under conditions where the gas temperature is much higher than the dust temperature. In particular, we find that carbon monoxide may become depleted by several orders of magnitude relative to its abundance predicted by chemical equilibrium models. These findings suggest that SMBO observations should take into account possible non-equilibrium effects when interpreting their spectra. \n \n Keywords: Chemical equilibrium; Dust grains; Local thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "We present an explicit criterion to determine whether or not two given multipartite quantum states are separable, i.e., can be written as convex combinations of product states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the Bloch representation of the corresponding density matrices and it relies only on local measurements performed by each party. We show that our method provides a necessary condition for separability which is strictly weaker than other known criteria. Finally we illustrate its usefulness with some examples. Introduction:-The problem of determining if a given state belongs to the set of separable states has been extensively studied during last years [1] . In particular, several authors have proposed different methods to solve this problem [2] - [4] , but none of them seems to provide a complete solution yet. Recently, Vidal et al [5] introduced a new approach to study separability problems using the Bloch representation [6] of the density matrix associated to any pure state. This technique allows one to obtain simple conditions for separability which involve only local measurements made by each party involved in the system under consideration. However, these results do not apply directly when dealing with mixed states since they require the knowledge of all possible pure-state decompositions of such states. Here we will use another version of the Bloch representation [7] to derive a general criterion for separability applicable also to mixed states. Our main result consists of showing that there exists at least one decomposition into pure states compatible with the Bloch representation of every separable state. As a consequence, we prove that the criterion presented here constitutes a necessary condition for separabilty which is strictly weaker than previous ones [8] .\nPreliminaries:-In what follows we consider N-partite systems described by Hilbert spaces H 1 ,H 2 ...H N . A generic element |ψ⟩ ∈ H = ∑ N i=1 H i is called a pure state vector while ρ ∈ D(H) denotes a density operator acting on H. Any density operator can always be expressed in terms of its spectral decomposition [9] \nwhere {|λ⟩} λ=1,...,d is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of ρ and p λ ≥ 0 (p",
    "We present the first exact local solution to the equations of motion for type II B supergravity in AdS 5 × S 5 . The solution is supported by two independent harmonic functions, one on each side of an arbitrary surface Σ which divides space into three regions. We show that this solution preserves eight real supercharges and has vanishing central charge. It can be interpreted as a bound state of N = 4 SYM theory with gauge group SU(N)×SU(N), where the number of degrees of freedom scales like O(N 2 ) at large N. In addition we find a new class of solutions describing interfaces between different vacua of the same field theory. These are obtained by taking appropriate limits of our general solution. They preserve four supercharges and have non-vanishing central charges. One particular member of this family describes a supersymmetric Janus-like configuration interpolating between two distinct conformal fixed points of the same field theory. \nIntroduction\n\nThe study of holographic duals of strongly coupled quantum systems has been greatly advanced over recent years through the use of string/M-theory [1, 2] . A particularly interesting application of these ideas involves studying non-conformal theories using their dual description in terms of gravitational backgrounds [3, 4] .\nIn order to construct such models it is necessary to solve the equations of motion associated with the relevant supergravity or gauged supergravity theory. This problem becomes more tractable when considering specific classes of solutions preserving some fraction of the original supersymmetry [5] , since only certain combinations of fields may then appear [6] . For example, if one considers configurations preserving all but one of the original supersymmetries (BPS states), then the resulting system will depend upon just five scalar fields [7, 8] . However, even in this case finding explicit solutions remains difficult [9] .\nOne approach to solving BPS-type problems is to consider special cases where the geometry admits additional symmetries [10] . An important subclass of such solutions arises when the internal manifold M 6 factorises into a product of two spaces M 3 × M 3 [11] . In this",
    "We show that correlation clustering is NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor, even for graphs with maximum degree three and clusters of size at most four.  We also present an algorithm which solves this problem exactly in time O(n3). Our results are based on reductions from the exact cover by 3-sets (X3C) problem. The X3C problem asks whether there exists a collection of subsets of a set S such that each element of S belongs to exactly 3 sets in the collection; it has been shown to be NP-complete. For more information about our work see http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0571 . \nCorrelation clustering is one of several problems studied under the umbrella of \"clustering\"; these include k-means clustering, spectral clustering, and graph partitioning. It was introduced independently by Bansal et al., Blum et al., and Dasgupta et al. as follows.   Given a weighted undirected graph G = (V, E), where V denotes the vertices and E denotes the edges, we say that two vertices u, v ∈ V are adjacent if they share an edge e ∈ E. A cluster C ⊆ V is defined as a subset of nodes whose pairwise distances satisfy some threshold t > 0. More formally, given a distance function d : V × V → R+ , let dist(u,v) denote the shortest path between u and v; then, C is said to be a valid cluster if and only if for all pairs of nodes u, v ∈ C:  dist(u,v)  ≤ t",
    "We present the results of our analysis of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with HST/STIS for four nearby (z<0.1), X-ray selected, Type Ib/c SNe in order to study their progenitor systems. We find that all four objects show evidence for dense CSM surrounding them at distances ranging between 0.01-0.2 pc. The presence of such material is consistent with theoretical expectations for post-low-velocity-bulge (post-LBV) Wolf-Rayet star winds. In addition we detect narrow emission features which are likely due to interaction between SN ejecta and this wind. These observations provide strong constraints on the nature of the progenitor systems: they require massive WR stars as well as binary companions capable of producing significant mass loss prior to explosion. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. We have analyzed high resolution STIS/HST data for 4 nearby (z<0.1; Xray-selected) type Ibc supernovae in an attempt to determine the properties of their progenitor systems. All four objects exhibit dense circumstellar matter (CSM; nH>1020 cm-3 ) within 0.01-0.20 parsecs of the supernova site. Such densities are expected if these explosions occur following the ejection of a low velocity \"bulge\" during late stages of stellar evolution. Furthermore, we observe narrow emission features which may be associated with shock-heating of the CSM by the expanding supernova remnant. Our findings suggest that these events result from the deaths of massive Wolf Rayet stars surrounded by close binaries.",
    "We study the generalized Dicke model with an arbitrary number N of two-level atoms interacting with one-mode radiation field, and show that it can be mapped to a spin-1/2 system by using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. We then use the exact diagonalization method to calculate its ground state energy spectrum for different values of the coupling constant g and the number N . The results are compared with those obtained by other methods such as perturbation theory and numerical integration. It is found that our results agree well with previous ones when the coupling strength is small but deviate significantly from them if the coupling becomes strong. Finally we discuss some possible applications of this work. PACS: 03.65.Ud, 05.45.Mt, 11.10.Gh, 12.20.Dc, 13.25.Gv \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe Dicke model [1] describes how many identical two-level atoms interact collectively with a single mode of electromagnetic field. In recent years there has been renewed interest in studying this model because of its potential application in quantum information processing [2] , quantum optics [3] , condensed matter physics [4] , etc.. For example, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum J = N /2 (N being the number of atoms) [5] .\nIn fact, the Dicke model was originally proposed more than half century ago [6] . Since then various theoretical approaches have been developed to solve it [7 -10] . Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation [11] which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system [12] . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states [13] . Recently, several authors [14 -19] have tried to overcome this difficulty by introducing new transformations or approximations. Nevertheless, their solutions still suffer from certain drawbacks [20, 21] .",
    "We consider the problem of estimating an unknown function f from noisy measurements y = Af + w, where A is a linear operator and w is white noise with known covariance matrix Cw.  We assume that the operator A has been discretized on some grid (e.g., by using finite differences or spectral methods) so that it can be represented as a large matrix.  The goal is to find an estimatef such that Ef − f  2 is minimized subject to certain constraints on the smoothness off . \nIn this work we propose new numerical techniques based on needlets which are able to efficiently solve these constrained optimization problems.  In particular, our approach allows us to obtain accurate estimates even when the number N of available observations is much smaller than the dimension M of the space spanned by the columns of A. \nThe proposed method relies on two main ingredients:  First, we use a sparse representation of functions in terms of needlets.  Second, we develop efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale convex optimization problems involving sparsity-promoting regularizers.  These algorithms combine ideas from compressed sensing theory and recent results about the convergence rate of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).",
    "We present new results on the contribution of BL Lacs (blazars) to the extragalactic gamma-ray background based on data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope between August 2008 and December 2010, corresponding to an effective exposure time of 1.6 yr for each source in our sample. We use two different methods to estimate this contribution: i) we calculate the number counts above 100 MeV as function of redshift using a maximum likelihood method; ii) we fit the observed spectral energy distribution with a log-parabola model and derive the integrated fluxes at 0.1 GeV and 10 TeV energies. The resulting contributions are consistent within statistical uncertainties. Our best-fit value is F(>100 MeV) = 2.2 x 10^{−8} ph cm−2 s−1 sr−1 which corresponds to ~20% of the measured EGB intensity. This result confirms that blazars are one of the main contributors to the EGB emission.",
    "We consider the statistical properties of nonstationary random acoustic and electromagnetical waves in terms of their correlation functions, power spectra, and probability density functions (PDFs). We show that these quantities can be expressed by means of solutions to certain partial differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. The PDFs are obtained for both stationary and nonstationary cases using the method of characteristics. In particular, we derive an exact expression for the PDF of the amplitude fluctuations of a monochromatic plane wave propagating through a turbulent medium. This result is used to obtain expressions for the mean-square fluctuation levels of the electric field strength and intensity at any point along the propagation path. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results to radiowave scintillation theory and radar detection problems. PACS: 42.65.Tg, 43.20 .Fx, 47.55.+q, 47.60.+j",
    "We present the spectroscopic follow-up observations for eight galaxy clusters at redshifts z=0.6-0.9 selected in the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). The sample is composed by four X-ray luminous and four optically rich clusters, with masses ranging between M500 = 1.5 × 1014 - 2.7 × 1014 h70M⊙ . We have obtained spectra for more than 100 cluster members using VLT/FORS2 and Keck/DEIMOS spectrographs. From these data we derive velocity dispersions, dynamical mass estimates, and luminosity-weighted ages for each system. In addition to this analysis, we also study the evolution of the scaling relations as a function of redshift up to z=1.1. Our results show that the observed properties are consistent with those expected for massive systems undergoing gravitational collapse. However, there seems to be an offset towards lower values of σv /σ⋆ compared to predictions based on numerical simulations.",
    "We present new Chandra X-ray Observatory observations and optical spectroscopy for the galaxy cluster Abell 576, which is known to have two merging components separated by about 1 arcmin (about 700 kpc). The northern component has been previously studied as an example of a \"line-of-sight bullet cluster\"; it shows no evidence of significant substructure or shock heating along its line of sight but does show signs of recent merger activity on smaller scales. In contrast, we find that the southern component appears relaxed with little sign of disturbance; however, this may be due to projection effects since there are several galaxies at large projected distances from the center of the cluster whose redshifts indicate they lie behind the cluster core. We also detect diffuse emission extending beyond the virial radius of both clusters, possibly indicating ongoing accretion onto these systems. These results suggest that Abell 576 will evolve into a single massive system within a few Gyrs.",
    "We present an approach to modeling epidemic spread using synthetic populations generated by massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). We use the population and mobility data collected for the City of Heroes MMOG, which has been played continuously since 2003 with over one million registered players worldwide. The game's persistent world is divided into regions that are connected via player movement between them. Each region contains a large number of individual households containing up to several hundred characters each. Our model uses this household-level information along with character-to-character contact rates inferred from the observed movements within the game to simulate disease transmission at both regional and global scales. We compare our results against epidemiological models based on real-world census data and find good agreement when we scale down the size of the simulated population appropriately. This suggests that large-scale virtual worlds such as MMOGs can be used to study epidemics without requiring access to sensitive personal health records or detailed demographic data.",
    "We study shelling-type orderings on regular cell complexes, which are defined by an ordering of their cells such that each new face is attached to exactly one old face in its boundary. We show how these can be used to construct acyclic matchings for the Salvetti complex associated with any finite Coxeter group W . This yields a combinatorial proof of the fact that the Poincaré polynomial of this complex satisfies P(t) = (1 − t)(1 + w∈W t l(w) ), where l denotes the length function on W .\nThe results presented here were obtained during my PhD thesis at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jürg Stadler. I would like to thank him as well as Prof. Dr. Peter Schmitt for many helpful discussions. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013 Grant Agreement n o 325928).",
    "We study the dynamics and emission properties of advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in which viscosity is caused by magnetic reconnections between field lines anchored to differentially rotating black holes. We find that, for reasonable values of parameters, such ADAFs can produce luminosities as high as those observed in quasars without violating any observational constraints on their mass inflow rates or temperatures at large radii. The main reason why our model works well is because it naturally produces an outflowing wind component whose kinetic energy flux greatly exceeds its thermal energy flux. This wind carries away most of the angular momentum so that the flow becomes nearly Keplerian near the black hole horizon. In addition, we show that this wind also provides enough pressure support against gravity to prevent the gas density from becoming too low there. Our results suggest that the winds produced by magnetized ADAF models may be responsible for driving powerful radio jets in active galactic nuclei.",

    "We study the effect of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) for an interacting two-dimensional electron system with parabolic dispersion and Zeeman splitting in presence of a uniform external magnetic field applied normal to the plane of motion. We show that SHC is independent of temperature, chemical potential and strength of disorder provided the Fermi energy lies within the Zeeman gap. The results are obtained by using the Kubo formula combined with the self-consistent Born approximation. It has been shown recently that the spin current can be generated without any net charge flow when electrons move through a nonmagnetic material under the influence of spin-orbit coupling [1] . This phenomenon known as spin Hall effect was first predicted theoretically [2] , and later observed experimentally [3] .\nThe origin of this effect is due to the fact that the spin-orbit interaction causes a transverse force which deflects the trajectories of moving particles leading to a finite spin polarization at the edges [4] . In recent years there have been several theoretical studies devoted to understand various aspects of spin Hall effect [5] - [8] . However most of these works were done either in absence or weak magnetic fields where the Landau levels do not play significant role [9] . On the other hand it is well known that the Landau level quantization plays important role in determining many physical properties such as magnetoresistance [10] , optical absorption [11] etc., especially near the quantum limit [12] . Therefore it would be interesting to investigate how the Landau levels affect the spin Hall effect.",
    "We study the ground state properties of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on square lattices with different types of interlayer couplings, including both homogeneous and inhomogeneous ones. We show that frustration can be suppressed by introducing an additional ferromagnetic coupling between layers which leads to formation of inhomogeneous magnetic states characterized by spatially modulated magnetization profiles. The obtained results are discussed within the framework of the recently developed concept of ``inverse condensation''. Introduction: In recent years there has been growing interest in studying strongly correlated systems where competing interactions lead to complex phase diagrams exhibiting various exotic phases such as valence bond solids (VBS), charge density waves (CDW) or supersolids [1-3]. One of the most interesting examples is provided by layered quantum antiferromagnets [4] . These compounds consist of weakly coupled planes of spins arranged into a regular lattice structure. Due to strong geometrical frustration caused by competing nearest-neighbor exchange interactions J1 along the chain direction and J2 across the chains, these materials exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena ranging from conventional Néel order at low temperatures down to disordered paramagnetic phases [5] .\nIn this work we consider two prototypical representatives of this class of materials: CuGeO3 [6] , where each plane consists of edge-sharing tetrahedra forming a honeycomb-like network [7, 8] , and BaCo2As2 [9] , where the planes are made up of corner-sharing triangles [10] . Both compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their unusual magnetic behavior [11, 12] . For example, it was shown experimentally that in CuGeO3 the system undergoes a transition from a collinear antiferromagnetically ordered state below TN = 29 K to a non-collinear VBS state above T* ~ 70 K [13] . On the other hand, for BaCo2As2 the situation seems more complicated since several experimental studies suggest coexistence of three different magnetic phases [14, 15] : a commensurate antiferromagnetically ordered phase below TC = 38 K; a helimagnetic",
    "We present Spitzer Space Telescope observations in the mid- to far-infrared (5.8 - 160 microns) for a sample of distant galaxies selected by their rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity density at 1600 angstroms, and compare these flux densities with those predicted using models that include dust extinction.  We find that the observed infrared emission is generally higher than expected based on the UV continuum slope alone; this excess emission can be explained if there are significant amounts of cold dust associated with star formation activity in these systems.   The results suggest that the majority of the energy produced by young stars may not escape into intergalactic space but instead is reprocessed by interstellar dust grains before being re-radiated in the infrared.

We find that the eta prime is dominantly composed of strange quark pairs (ss) at low energies but becomes more nonstrange as energy increases. The mass difference between the eta and eta prime mesons can be explained if we assume that the eta prime contains an additional ss pair compared to the eta.

After flagging bad channels we produced Stokes Q and U maps which are shown in Figure 1 . \n \n Polarized intensity images were also created but these did not reveal any significant polarized emission above our noise level.

    "We present the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution of dark matter haloes within different cosmic environments (clusters, filaments, sheets and voids). We find that:\n(i) The mass accretion histories of clusters are dominated by major mergers with other massive systems at high redshifts z > 1.\n(ii) In contrast to clusters, most of the growth of filamentary structures is driven by smooth gas accretion along their length.  This leads to an extended formation history for these objects which can be traced back to early times z < 5. (iii) Sheet-like structures form through the merger of smaller filaments into larger ones. They grow mainly via smooth gas accretion but also experience minor mergers with small groups or galaxies during their lifetime. (iv) Voids evolve almost exclusively due to smooth gas accretion. Their assembly time-scales are typically longer than those of clusters and filaments because they have less dense surroundings.",

We find that the brightest part of the shell is located between two dark lanes which are probably caused by dust extinction. In addition we detect several small knots embedded within the shell. These knots may be remnants of massive stars or protostars formed during an earlier phase of star formation activity in this region. Finally, we identify a number of Herbig-Haro objects associated with the open clusters Trumpler 14 and 15. Our results show that the Carina Nebulae is still actively forming stars today.

    "We study the phenomenological consequences of general speed of sound in brane inflationary models, where the inflaton is identified as the distance between two parallel branes moving on an extra dimension. We find that for small values of the speed of sound (cs < 0.1), there are no significant changes to the predictions made by standard slow-roll inflation. However, when cs > 0.1 we find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the running of the spectral index dns/d ln k can be significantly enhanced compared to their usual values predicted within the context of single field slow roll inflation. In particular, if cs = 1 then r = 16(nT)2/5 and dns/d ln k = −8(nT)1/5, which may provide a possible explanation for recent observations of high value of nT reported by WMAP7 data combined with other CMB experiments.",

The only exception is LP 944-20 which has been shown to be a member of the Hyades supercluster by its proper motion.  These results confirm previous suggestions that most brown dwarfs have ages less than 100 Myr. They also show that there may exist two populations among the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs: those associated with open clusters/associations and those apparently not gravitationally bound to any cluster. This suggests that either some brown dwarfs form outside open clusters and/or they evaporate rapidly after formation.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\n\nThe recent experimental realization of quantum degenerate gases has opened up new avenues towards understanding strongly correlated many-body systems [1] . In particular, ultracold atomic gases have been used as model systems to explore phenomena such as fermionization [2] , supersolidity [3] , and Mott-insulating states [4] .\nIn this article we consider a particularly interesting class of experiments where the properties of these systems can be probed through their response to sudden changes in parameters [5] . For example, if the strength of inter-particle repulsion or density of particles is suddenly changed then it takes some time before the system reaches thermal equilibrium [6] . During this nonequilibrium evolution, the system may exhibit novel features like dynamical scaling [7, 8] and non-thermal fixed points [9] . These effects are not only important for our fundamental understanding of quantum matter but also provide useful insights into possible routes to realizing novel phases of matter [10] .\nRecently there has been considerable interest in studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosonic systems [11] . A particularly well studied case is when the initial state corresponds to a highly excited state above the ground state [12] . It turns out that even though the initial state is far away from equilibrium, the system relaxes to a steady state described by a Gibbs ensemble [13] . However, if the initial state is prepared deep inside the ordered phase, then the system does not",
    "We propose an experiment to entangle two independent photons in the time domain, using only linear optical elements and single-photon detectors.  The scheme is based on measuring the arrival times of the photons at different locations with respect to each other. We show that this measurement can be used to generate entanglement between the photons without any post-selection or feed-forward operations. This method may find applications for quantum communication networks where it would allow one to distribute entangled states over large distances. Entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from condensed matter systems [1] , atomic gases [2] , and trapped ions [3] to quantum information processing [4] . In particular, entanglement has been shown to be essential for quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , quantum key distribution [7] , and quantum computing [8] .\nIn recent years there have been several proposals to create entanglement between distant particles [9] - [11] . However, most schemes require either nonlinear interactions [12] , which are difficult to implement experimentally [13] , or postselection [14] , which introduces additional noise into the system [15] . Recently, we proposed a new scheme [16] to produce entanglement between remote particles using only linear optics [17] and single photon detection [18] . Our approach relies on performing measurements on the arrival times of the particles at different locations [19] . Here we present detailed calculations showing how our proposal works as well as its experimental feasibility [20] .  Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of our setup. Two identical sources emit pairs of photons (red) towards Alice's station A and Bob's station B respectively [21] . Each source consists of a pulsed laser [22] generating pairs of photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion [23] . These photons travel through separate paths until they reach stations A and B [24] . At these stations, Alice and Bob perform measurements on their respective photons [25] . They measure the arrival times tA and tB [26] of...",
    "We present an analysis on the spatial and velocity distributions of the young (<10Myr) stars within 0.5pc of Sgr A*, based on our spectroscopic survey with Subaru/HDS. We find that these stars are distributed into two groups along the line-of-sight; one is located at ~0.1pc to the west side of Sgr A* and another is found at ~0.3pc to its east side. The former group has a mean radial velocity of -200km/sec while the latter shows +100km/sec. These results suggest that there exist two distinct populations of young stars around Sgr A*; one is associated with the clockwise disk-like structure seen in infrared images and the other may be related to the counter-clockwise rotating ring-like feature recently discovered by Genzel et al. (2003) . In addition we have identified several new candidate members for the clockwise disk population.",
    "We have studied the effect of masking out part of sky for CMB temperature fluctuations by using simulated data sets and found that it is important to take into account the effects of masked pixels when estimating angular power spectrum (APS) at large angles, especially for low multipoles l < 20. We also find that the APS estimated with the standard method based on spherical harmonics decomposition can be biased if there are significant correlations between masked and unmasked regions. In this work we propose an improved method which takes these effects into account. The new method has been applied to estimate the APS of the WMAP three-year data set after removing point sources detected above 5 mJy beam −1 .

    "We report on Suzaku observations for four active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by Swift/BAT survey, which are classified as \"obscured AGNs\" with column density larger than 10 24 cm-2 . We found that all these sources show strong Fe K emission lines and their line widths are broader than those expected from thermal broadening at kT = 100 keV. The observed line profiles can be reproduced well by relativistic disk reflection models including Compton scattering effects. These results suggest that there is an additional component to the X-ray continuum other than the standard thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes. In addition, we find that the iron abundance relative to solar value is higher than 1.5 times in three out of four objects. This suggests that the central engines of these obscured AGNs may have been buried under heavy dusty torii. Finally, we discuss possible origins of this new type of buried supermassive black holes based on our observational results.",
    "We present the results of our analysis of cosmic ray data collected by the PAMELA experiment in 2008 and 2009, which show an excess over background at energies between 1-10 GeV/nucleon that is consistent with being produced by particles accelerated in nearby supernova remnants (SNRs). We find that this signal can be explained if we assume that SNR RX J1713-3946 accelerates protons up to 10 TeV energy per nucleon. The observed fluxes are also compatible with those expected for other known sources such as pulsars or active galactic nuclei. However, these alternative scenarios cannot explain all features seen in the data set. In particular, they do not predict any significant anisotropy in arrival directions on angular scales below ~10 degrees. This prediction is confirmed by observations made using the Tibet ASγ air shower array. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our findings for models of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.",
    "The gamma ray emission in the energy range 100 MeV to 10 GeV is studied using data taken by EGRET on board CGRO during its first four years of operation (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) . The analysis has been performed for two different regions, one centered at l = 0° and b = - 5° , which includes the galactic centre region, and another centered at l = 180° and b = + 5° . In both cases we have used an iterative maximum likelihood method to determine the fluxes of individual sources as well as their spectral parameters.  We find that there are three distinct components contributing to the observed gamma-ray flux above 1 GeV :  A diffuse component with a power law spectrum extending upto ~10 GeV .\nA point source located near Sgr A* with a power law spectrum .\nAn extended source towards the galactic center with a broken power law spectrum . \nWe also present results obtained when the same analysis was repeated after excluding the contribution due to the central part of the Galaxy .",
    "We have studied the pulse-to-pulse intensity variations in two pulsars, PSR B0826-34 and PSR B1133+16, using data obtained with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz (92cm) and 2.7GHz(36cm). We find that both pulsars show strong evidence for subpulse drift bands which are modulated by an underlying pattern of weaker emission. The observed patterns can be explained as due to interference between different modes of emission within each beam. In addition we find that there is no significant difference in the subpulse modulation properties when comparing observations made at 36cm and those made at 92cm. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for producing these phenomena operate over a wide range of frequencies. These results provide further support for the idea that the phenomenon known as drifting subpulses may arise through some form of plasma instability operating on the open field lines near the magnetic poles of neutron stars. \n \n Keywords: Pulsar",
    "We present results for MHD simulations of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a stratified, Keplerian disk threaded by an initially vertical magnetic field using the ZEUS-2D code. We consider both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state to examine how the MRI depends on the thermodynamics of the gas. In all cases we find that the growth rate of the fastest growing mode agrees well with linear theory predictions when normalized appropriately. However, there are significant differences between our runs depending upon whether or not they have reached steady-state equilibrium. For example, the saturated level of stress achieved at late times varies significantly among different models. This suggests that it may be difficult to accurately predict the saturation amplitude of the MRI unless one can perform very high resolution calculations which evolve over many orbital periods. Finally, we show that the inclusion of radiative cooling has little effect on the properties of the turbulence generated by the MRI.",
    "We report on the discovery of an unexpected ring-like dark matter structure at the center of galaxy cluster CL0024+17, which is located about 3 billion light years away and has been studied extensively by many observational techniques including gravitational lensing.  The mass distribution inferred from strong gravitational lensing shows that there are two massive subclusters separated by 1 Mpc (3 arcmin) with a total mass of 2 x 10 15 h-1M_sun within a radius of 0.5h-1Mpc around their centers. We find that this double-cluster system can be well described as a binary merger model where each component consists of three components; one main halo and two smaller halos surrounding it. In addition to these six clusters, we also detect another small clump of galaxies near the center of the merging system whose position coincides with the peak of X-ray emission detected by Chandra satellite observations.",
    "We present an analysis of the distribution and properties of open clusters in the Galactic anticenter region, using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). We have compiled a list of all open clusters with angular diameters larger than 1 arcmin within a distance of 8 kpc from the Sun. The total number is about 1000. This sample includes most known open clusters in this part of the Galaxy. Using photometric distances derived by fitting theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks to observed color-magnitude diagrams for each cluster we construct maps showing their spatial distributions as well as their luminosity functions. Our results show that there are two distinct populations of open clusters: one population located at galactocentric radii between 4 and 6 kpc which has ages less than 3 Gyr; another population located at galactocenric radii greater than 7 kpc which has ages older than 5 Gyr.",
    "We present new results on the age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance for galactic globular clusters (GGCs) based on single stellar population models with different prescriptions for convection theory. We find that the ages derived by using the classical mixing-length theory are systematically younger than those obtained by assuming overshooting or semiconvection in the red giant branch phase. The difference between these two sets of ages is about 0.5 Gyr at most. For some metal-rich GGCs, we also found that their ages inferred from the classical mixing-length theory can be as young as 10 Gyr while they should have been older than 12 Gyr according to other methods. This discrepancy may result from the fact that the classical mixing-length theory cannot reproduce well the observed color-magnitude diagrams of such metal-rich GGCs. Our results show that there exists no significant correlation between the cluster's age and its metallicity.  These findings suggest that the formation history of GGCs might not be dominated by monolithic collapse but instead by hierarchical merging processes.",
    "We present an overview of the theory for vortices in trapped, dilute atomic gases at low temperatures. We discuss how these systems can be described by macroscopic wave functions and show that they are governed by nonlinear Schrödinger equations with external potentials. The solutions to this equation have been studied extensively over many years and we review some of their properties relevant to vortex formation. In particular, we consider stationary states which correspond to condensate configurations without rotation (vortex-free) as well as rotating ones where quantized angular momentum is carried by phase singularities known as vortices. Finally, we briefly describe recent experiments on vortex production in cold atom clouds. Vortices occur naturally in superfluids such as liquid helium or dilute atomic gases. They carry quantized angular momenta and play important roles in various physical phenomena including turbulence and quantum transport processes. Here we give an introduction into the theoretical description of vortices in trapped atomic gases.",
    "We present deep imaging data for the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Hercules (dSph), obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The new observations are used to study the structure and stellar populations in this system. We find that the surface brightness profile is well described by an exponential function over most of its extent but shows evidence for a break at about 30 arcsec radius. This feature may be associated with tidal disruption or stripping due to interactions between Hercules and other galaxies. Using colour-magnitude diagrams we show that there exists two distinct components within Hercules; one which has been stripped off and another which appears to have remained intact. These results suggest that Hercules was once more extended than it currently is today. Finally, using our photometric catalogue we measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersion as a function of projected distance from the centre of Hercules. Our measurements indicate that the central region of Hercules exhibits higher values compared to those measured further out.",
    "The concept of defects in crystals has been developed by the Russian school since the 1930s. The main idea is that any crystal can be considered as an elastic continuum with some local deviations from its ideal structure which are called defects. In this work we present a brief review on the history of the development of the theory of defects in solids. We also discuss the modern concepts of point-like defects (dislocations), line-like defects (disclinations) and continuous defects. Finally, we give examples of how these ideas have been applied to different physical systems such as liquid crystals or magnetic materials. Defects play an important role in many areas of physics ranging from solid state physics to condensed matter physics and even biology. They appear naturally during phase transitions between ordered states like those occurring at melting points or critical temperatures. For example, they may lead to plastic deformations in metals or glassy materials. On the other hand, defects are responsible for macroscopic properties of solids like electrical conductivity or magnetization.",
    "We present an algorithm that systematically scans all possible 7-colourings of the grid, and report on its performance in terms of running time and memory consumption. The algorithm is based on a simple backtracking scheme combined with some heuristics to prune parts of the search space.

For each instance we provide detailed information about how much time was spent by our program during colouring as well as how many colours were used. In addition, we also show how these results compare against those obtained by other algorithms proposed recently in the literature. \n \n Keywords: Coloring problems, Computational complexity theory, Graphs, Backtrack search, Heuristic methods, Grid graphs, Integer programming, Optimization problems, Search trees, Time-complexity analysis \n \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n A graph G = (V, E) consists of two sets V and E where V denotes the set of vertices or nodes and E denotes the set of edges between pairs of nodes.

    "We revisit the constraints imposed by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) observations on the possible existence of massive, unstable neutrinos with lifetimes longer than 10^(10) s. We find that these limits are significantly weaker if one allows for non-standard interactions between neutrinos and photons in addition to standard weak interactions. In particular we show that BBN can be compatible with an unstable tau-neutrino mass as large as mtau = 1 TeV even when its decay rate is suppressed by a factor of 10^{10} compared to the Standard Model prediction. This result has important implications for models of leptogenesis which require heavy Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos. The possibility of such light unstable particles also opens up new avenues for probing physics beyond the Standard Model at future colliders like LHC or ILC.",

    "We report on neutron scattering experiments performed to study spin fluctuations and magnetic correlations in the metallic phase of quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br (κ-Br). We find that the temperature dependence of the static susceptibility χ0 is well described by the Curie-Weiss law with an antiferromagnetic Weiss constant θ = -26 K, indicating strong antiferromagnetic interactions between spins. The observed broadening of the elastic linewidth Γel at low temperatures indicates short-range spin-spin correlation lengths ξs ~ 5 nm. In addition we observe a large enhancement of the dynamic susceptibility χ′′(Q,ω), which can be attributed to the development of low-energy spin excitations below T* ~ 50 K. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions for two-dimensional systems close to quantum criticality. Our data suggest that the system undergoes a transition into a state where the Fermi surface becomes unstable against formation of electron-hole pairs leading to Cooper pairing. \n \n Introduction \n \n A number of recent studies have shown that many strongly correlated electronic materials exhibit unconventional properties such as high-temperature superconductivity or non-Fermi liquid behavior [1] . One important aspect of these phenomena is the presence of collective charge and/or spin degrees of freedom [2] , whose dynamics often give rise to characteristic features in the excitation spectrum [3] . For example, in cuprate-based high-temperature superconductors [4] , it has been suggested that the pseudogap regime [5] may arise due to competing orders [6] originating from different regions of the Brillouin zone [7, 8] . Similarly, in iron pnictide compounds [9] , the appearance of a spin-density wave order parameter [10] leads to a suppression of the density-of-states near the Fermi level [11] resulting in a partial gap opening [12] . Finally, in heavy fermion metals [13] , the hybridization of localized f-electrons [14] gives rise to a nontrivial momentum structure of the self-energy [15] .\n \nIn this work, we present detailed measurements of the spin fluctuation spectrum in the metallic phase of the quasi",
    "We study the energy transfer in a network of coupled nonlinear oscillators with time delay, which is motivated by the dynamics of biological systems such as neural networks and genetic regulatory networks. We show that there exists an optimal coupling strength for each individual oscillator to achieve maximum energy transfer efficiency among all other oscillators. The results are obtained through numerical simulations on both small-scale and large-scale networks. In particular, we find that the energy transfer efficiency decreases when the number of nodes increases beyond a certain threshold value. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the total amount of available energy per node decreases rapidly due to the increase of the number of nodes. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings to real-world problems. Energy transfer plays important roles in many natural phenomena including brain activity [1] , heartbeat [2] , and gene regulation [3] . It has been shown recently that efficient energy transfer may also exist in complex networks [4] - [6] .\nIn this work, we consider a system consisting of N identical nonlinear oscillators connected via delayed couplings (see Fig.   1 ).

    "The availability of computer systems is an important aspect in the design, development and operation of any system. The aim of this research was to develop a method for assessing the availability of a large number of SunOS/Solaries systems using syslogd (System Logging Daemon) and wtmpx (Windows Time Machine eXtender). This research has been carried out by collecting data from a set of servers over a period of one year. A total of 1,000,000 records were collected during that time frame. These records have then been processed into a database which contains information about each record such as timestamps, host name, service type etc.. In order to assess the availability of these systems we developed two algorithms; one algorithm calculates the percentage uptime per day while another algorithm calculates the percentage downtime per hour. We also implemented a web interface so that users can view the results obtained from our analysis.",
    "We study the entanglement between two atoms trapped inside an optical cavity, each interacting with one mode of the electromagnetic field. We consider both resonant and nonresonant interactions for different initial states of the system. In particular we show that it is possible to generate maximally entangled Bell-like states by using only local operations on the atomic subsystem. The results are obtained by solving numerically the Schrödinger equation describing the evolution of the system. Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information processing [1] . It has been shown [2] , however, that even if all parties involved share maximal entanglement at some point during their communication protocol they may not be able to perform any useful task due to decoherence effects [3] .\nIn this work we investigate how entanglement can be generated among two atoms trapped inside an open optical cavity [4] . Each atom interacts locally with its own photon mode which is coupled to another external photon mode via a mirror (see Fig.  1 ). This model describes many physical systems such as semiconductor microcavities [5] or cold atoms [6] . For example, in Ref. [7] it was proposed to use a Bose-Einstein condensate confined within a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity [8] to produce single photons [9] . These photons could then be used to entangle distant qubits [10] .",
    "We study the SLE (Schramm-Loewner Evolution) process for the scaling limit of interfaces between different phases in the two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions on an arbitrary planar graph, and its generalization to higher dimensions. We show that the interface is described by a chordal Schramm-Löwner evolution if the underlying lattice has no loops or multiple edges; otherwise it is described by a radial Schramm-Löwner evolutions. The results are obtained using conformal field theory techniques. In particular we use the fact that the partition function of these models can be written as a correlation function of primary fields in some rational conformal field theories. This allows us to obtain explicit formulas for the probability distribution functions of various geometric quantities associated with the interfaces such as their winding numbers around vertices etc.. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE)\nprocesses were introduced by Schramm [Sch00] , who showed that they provide a natural description of the scaling limits of interfaces in statistical mechanics systems at criticality. These processes have been studied extensively since then both theoretically and numerically. For example, see [KSS02, SS04a, SS04b, RS05, Sch06, CS07, KS08, KSV09, KM10, MS11, MZ12, BMS13, BS14, LW15, GKS16, GM17, GK18, HJ19, HK20, JPS20] . A comprehensive review of this subject may be found in [Smi01, Sta03, Joh10] .\nIn this work we consider the SLE process for the scaling limit in two dimensions of interfaces separating different phases in the following class of models:  Let G = (V, E) be any finite connected planar graph without loops or multiple edges. Consider the Ising model with nearest neighbor interaction defined on G. That is, let {σv}v∈V denote a collection of random variables taking values +1 and −1, where each σv represents the state of vertex v ∈ V . Then",
    "We present the results of an X-ray study of supernova remnant (SNR) G299.2-2.9 using data obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories. The SNR is located in the constellation Puppis at a distance of ~5 kpc, which corresponds to its angular size of about 30 arcmin. We find that the spectrum of this object can be described by two thermal components with temperatures T1=7×10^6 K and T2=2×10^6 K. In addition, we detect non-thermal emission above 10 keV. Using these parameters, we estimate the age of the SNR as t=4000 yr. This value agrees well with the characteristic time for the expansion of the shell into the surrounding medium. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the observed morphology of the SNR is consistent with the model of a spherical explosion expanding into a uniform interstellar medium.",
    "The design and kinematics analysis of parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) is presented in this work using kinetic-static performance criteria. The proposed approach considers the dynamic behavior of PKMTs during their operation, which has been neglected by previous works on PKMTs. In addition to the static stiffness matrix, the inertia properties are also considered for the evaluation of the overall dynamic response of PKMTs. A new method based on the concept of virtual joints is developed to calculate the mass distribution along each leg of the PKMT under consideration. This information can be used as an input data set for further dynamic analyses such as modal or harmonic vibration analysis. Finally, two different PKMTs with three degrees-of-freedom per joint are designed and analyzed using the proposed methodology. It was found that the first PKMT exhibits better dynamic characteristics than its counterpart due to its lower natural frequencies and higher damping ratios.",
    "The geochemical behavior of uranium (U) and thorium (Th), which are radioactive elements, is discussed in relation to their influence on the origin and evolution of the crust of earth as well as biological evolution.  The chemical properties of these two elements are similar; however, they have different physical characteristics that affect how they behave geologically.  Uranium has an atomic number of 92 with a half-life of 4.5 billion years while thorium has an atomic number of 90 with a half life of 1.4 billion years.   Both elements occur naturally throughout the Earth's crust but at varying concentrations depending upon the rock type.  They can be found in igneous rocks such as granite or basalt where they form minerals like uranite or thorite respectively.

    "The response prediction of structural system subject to earthquake motions is very important for the design and construction of buildings in seismic areas, especially when it comes to high-rise building structures. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed by using data obtained through nonlinear dynamic analysis on reinforced concrete frame structure subjected to earthquake ground motion records. The ANN model consists of three layers; input layer, hidden layer with 10 neurons, output layer with one neuron representing maximum inter-story drift ratio. Input variables used are peak ground acceleration, duration time, number of stories, story height, mass density per unit floor area, damping coefficient, yield strength of steel bar, elastic modulus of steel bar, shear wall stiffness, and moment capacity of beam-column joint. To verify the accuracy of the proposed ANN model, results predicted by the ANN were compared with those calculated by nonlinear dynamic analysis program. It can be concluded that the ANN model has good performance in predicting the maximum inter-story drift ratios under various earthquake ground motions.",
    "We present the results on the interband, intraband and excitonic transitions for Si and Ge nanocrystals (NCs) embedded into Al2O3 matrix by using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory within local-density approximation. The NC size is varied between 1 nm to 5 nm with an interval of 0.5 nm. We find that the optical gap decreases as we increase the NC size due to quantum confinement effect. In addition, we observe that the lowest energy peak shifts towards higher energies when increasing the NC size which can be attributed to the surface states. Furthermore, our calculated results show that the oscillator strength increases significantly at smaller sizes while it decreases rapidly at larger sizes. Finally, we also investigate the influence of strain on the electronic structure of these systems. Our findings are expected to provide useful information about the design of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. \n \n Keywords: Silicon Nanocrystal, Germanium Nanocrystal, Optical properties",
    "We present the results of our study on super star clusters (SSCs) in which we have found that SSCs can be divided into two categories, namely, those having a single mode and those having a double-mode solution for their density profiles. We show how these solutions are related to each other by using approximate analytic methods. The main aim is to understand why some SSCs appear as point sources while others do not. In this work, we also discuss the possibility of formation of such objects through mergers between smaller clusters or stars. Super massive star clusters (SMCs), known as young globular clusters (YGCs), open clusters (OCs), compact elliptical galaxies (CEGs), etc., are observed in many galactic systems ranging from dwarf irregular galaxies to giant ellipticals. These objects are believed to form during violent events like galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and/or gas-rich major mergers. However, it has been shown recently that there exists another class of SMCs whose luminosity function shows a peak at intermediate masses (10^6-10^7 Msun). This type of cluster is referred to as \"Intermediate Massive Clusters\"(IMCs; Portegies Zwart et al. (2010)). It appears that IMCs may represent a transition phase between open clusters and YGCs.",
    "We present an analysis of the temperature dependence of thermally stimulated luminescent (TSL) glow curves in terms of the nonstationary electron-phonon relaxation theory, which does not assume that the system is close to equilibrium at any time during its evolution.  We show how this approach can be used for extracting information about the phonon spectrum and the density of states of charge carriers from TSL data obtained on different types of materials. The results are compared with those obtained by other methods such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy or Raman scattering. In particular we demonstrate that our method allows one to determine the energy gap between the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum in semiconductors. This work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant No. 14-50-00040. DOI: 10.1063/1.4935190 \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of luminescence phenomena has been attracting considerable attention over many years because it provides valuable information about electronic structure and optical properties of solids [1] . Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly useful since it enables us to probe the distribution function of electrons excited into the conduction band [2] .\nIn recent decades there have been numerous attempts to develop theoretical models describing various aspects of luminescence processes [3] , including thermal stimulation luminescence [4] - [8] . However, most of these works were based on the assumption that the system under consideration is always close to equilibrium [9] . As a result they cannot describe correctly some important features observed experimentally [10] . For example, the shape of the TSL glow curve depends strongly on the type of material [11] : while in insulators it usually exhibits a single peak [12] , in metals it often consists of several peaks [13] . Moreover, even within the same class of materials, e.g., semiconductor crystals [14] , the number of peaks may vary depending on the doping level [15] . These observations cannot be explained using existing theories [16] .",
    "We introduce the notion of intersection bodies in arbitrary dimensions, generalizing the classical concept for dimension two to higher dimensions. We show that intersection bodies are characterized by their Fourier transforms which we call generalized cosine transforms (GCT). The GCTs can be used as an alternative tool to study intersection bodies. In particular, we prove that intersection bodies have positive volume if and only if they are convex. This is done using a new characterization of intersection bodies via their support functions. Finally, we give some examples of intersection bodies in three dimensions. Keywords: Intersection body; Support function; Convexity; Volume; Fourier transform; Three-dimensional space. 1 Introduction Let K n denote the set of all origin-symmetric convex bodies in R n . For any K ∈ K n , let V(K) = |K|/|B n 2 | where | · | denotes Lebesgue measure on R n . Then V : K n → [0, 1] is called the volume functional. A compactly supported continuous function f : S n−1 → C with unit integral will be called a spherical harmonic of degree m. If f has no zeros then it is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a constant. It follows immediately that every spherical harmonic of degree m satisfies the following properties:\n(1) |f (x)| ≤ 1; (2) f (−x) = f (x), x ∈ S n−1 ; (3) (Spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis.) Definition 1. An origin-symmetric convex body K ∈ K n is said to be an intersection body if there exists a non-negative real number λ such that its surface area measure σ K satisfies",
    "In this work, we study the problem of clustering co-occurrences of maximal frequent patterns (MFP) in streams. We propose an algorithm that clusters MFPs based on their occurrences and then uses these clusters to build a compact representation for each pattern. The proposed approach is efficient both in terms of space consumption as well as time required to process new data points. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude while achieving high accuracy. In addition, it can be easily parallelized using existing frameworks such as MapReduce or Spark. Keywords: Data stream mining, Cluster analysis, Frequent itemset mining, Association rule learning, Time series prediction. 1 Introduction Mining large volumes of streaming data has become increasingly important over recent years due to its wide range of applications including sensor networks [20, 21] , social media analytics [22] , fraud detection [23] , network intrusion detection [24] , etc.. However, processing massive amounts of streaming data poses several challenges since traditional batch-based approaches are not applicable anymore [25] . For example, if one wants to detect anomalies in a continuous flow of tweets, he needs to continuously monitor all incoming messages and identify those which deviate significantly from normal behavior [26] .\nTo address these issues, researchers have developed various techniques for analyzing data streams [7, 8, 27 ]. An emerging area within data stream mining focuses on discovering interesting patterns from data streams [28] . A common task in this context is finding frequent items/patterns in data streams [29] . Another popular research direction involves identifying correlations between different attributes [30] . These tasks are often performed jointly with classification [31] and/or regression [32] problems.",
    "We present the results of an extensive study of gas dynamics, star formation activity, dust extinction, stellar populations, and black hole accretion properties for a strongly lensed galaxy (A1689-zD1) at redshift 3.07. The lensing magnification factor is ~30Â±5. We use deep near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the kinematics of molecular hydrogen emission lines with high spatial resolution.

One of these components shows strong HÎ² emission indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGN).

    "The ultimate fate of the universe is one of the most important questions in physics and cosmology today, but it has been difficult to answer because quantum mechanics (QM) cannot be applied directly to macroscopic systems such as the whole universe.  In this talk I will present an approach that allows us to use QM to study the evolution of the universe on all scales by applying it only to small subsystems within the universe.   This method can also be used to calculate the probability distribution for the time at which the universe ends its existence. The results are consistent with current observations and provide new insights into how the universe may end up. For example, we find that there is a finite probability that the universe will expand forever without ever ending or collapsing. We also show that if the universe does collapse then it must do so before 10^(10^28) years have passed since the Big Bang. Finally, we discuss some possible implications of these results for the future of humanity.",
    "We study the evolution of cosmic strings in an expanding universe, focusing on their formation mechanism and subsequent growth. We show that cosmic strings can form when magnetic fields are trapped inside overdense regions during inflation. The resulting network consists of many small loops which evolve into larger ones through gravitational radiation emission. This process is similar to the one proposed for electroweak strings formed at phase transitions after inflation. However, we find that the loop distribution function has a different shape than previously assumed. In particular, it contains more large loops with sizes comparable to the Hubble radius today. These loops may be detectable as stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves or gamma rays. Cosmic strings have been predicted to exist since the early 1980s [1, 2] . They could arise naturally if there were extra dimensions beyond those observed so far [3] , or they might be produced at symmetry breaking phase transitions [4] .\nCosmic strings would produce observable effects such as gravitational lensing [5] , CMB anisotropies [6] , and primordial black holes [7, 8] . Despite this interest, no direct detection of cosmic strings has yet been made [9] . One reason why cosmic strings remain elusive is because they are expected to be very light (with masses less than $10^{-16}eV$) [10] . Another problem is that cosmic strings are not stable objects but rather decay rapidly via gravitational radiation [11] . Therefore, any observational evidence must come indirectly from the products of cosmic string decays [12] .\nIn order to make predictions about possible observations, cosmological simulations need to be performed [13] . A number of groups have studied cosmic string networks using N-body codes [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64",
    "We consider the effective inverse spectral problems (EISP) associated with rational Lax matrices, which are generalizations of classical EISP in terms of Jacobi matrices. We show that these new EISPs can be reduced to some special cases of classical EISP by using an explicit formula for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a rational matrix. As examples we study two classes of rational Lax matrices: one is related to the Toda lattice hierarchy and another is connected with the modified Volterra lattice hierarchy. In particular, we give a complete description on all solutions of the corresponding EISPs. Finally, as applications of our results, we present several interesting properties about the spectra of these rational Lax matrices. The research was supported by NSFC under Grant No.11571040.

    "We report on the detection by Swift/BAT and Konus-Wind of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060927, which is one of only two events detected with redshifts greater than five to date.  The redshift was determined using optical spectroscopy obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile within three hours after the burst trigger time.  We find that this event has an extremely hard spectrum, similar to other high-redshift bursts observed previously.  Using our current understanding of the physics behind these phenomena we can estimate the total energy released during the prompt emission phase of the burst to be ~10^53 erg.  This value is comparable to or larger than the energies released by some supernovae.  If confirmed, it would make GRB 060927 the most energetic event ever recorded.  In addition, if the host galaxy mass function evolves similarly to what is seen locally, then the progenitor system responsible for producing such an energetic explosion must have been hosted by a very massive galaxy.  These results are consistent with theoretical predictions made about the progenitors of high-z GRBs.  Finally, we discuss how future observations of this object may help us understand the end of cosmic reionization.",
    "We report on the first simultaneous infrared (IR) and X-ray observations of Sgr A*, made with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2007-2008. We find that the IR emission is consistent with being produced by dust heated to temperatures between 100 K and 1000 K; this temperature range corresponds to an observed flux density at 8 microns ranging from 0.1 mJy to 1 Jy. The spectral index of the IR emission does not change significantly during these variations. This result suggests that the physical conditions within the emitting region are relatively constant over time scales as short as one month. These results also suggest that the IR emission may be dominated by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron radiation. \n \n Keywords: black hole physics, infrared astronomy, radio source variability, space telescopes, X-ray astronomy \n \n \n \n Black holes have been predicted to produce intense electromagnetic fields near their event horizons. However, direct observational evidence has remained elusive because of the extreme environment surrounding such objects. One possible way to detect such fields would be through the detection of polarized light emitted close to the horizon. Another possibility involves detecting changes in the spectrum or intensity of the accretion flow onto the black hole itself. Such changes could occur if the magnetic field lines threading the disk were twisted into helical shapes due to differential rotation. If so, they can act like antennae which amplify any incoming waves along them. As a consequence, the local plasma frequency will increase, causing the plasma to become more opaque to lower-frequency waves but less opaque to higher frequencies. Thus, we expect the spectrum of the emission to steepen toward longer wavelengths when the system becomes brighter.",
    "We study the problem of finding an optimal schedule for data transmission over multiple channels with interference constraints, where each channel is assigned to one transmitter-receiver pair and transmissions on different pairs are subject to mutual interference. We consider two models: (i) The first model assumes that all transmitters have fixed power levels. (ii) In the second model we assume that transmitters can adjust their powers dynamically. For both cases, we show how to find an optimal schedule by solving a sequence of linear programs. Our results hold even if there exists only one receiver per transmitter. This work was supported by NSF grant CCF-0430018. 1 Introduction Wireless networks consist of many nodes communicating via radio signals. Each node has limited range and thus cannot communicate directly with every other node. Instead, it communicates indirectly through intermediate nodes called relays or routers. A fundamental question in this context is: How should these relays be placed?",
    "We have studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations how the dynamic behavior of silver atoms deposited on gold (100) is affected when the substrate temperature and the coverage are varied in such a way that the average number of nearest neighbors per atom changes between 1 to 4. We find that, for low coverages, the system behaves as if it were made up of isolated particles with no interaction among them. However, at higher coverages we observe collective effects which lead to the formation of ordered structures. The results obtained show that these structures can be classified into two different categories depending on whether they are formed by one or more layers of silver atoms. In particular, we found that the structure of the first layer depends strongly on the substrate temperature while the second layer shows only small variations. Finally, our calculations indicate that the third layer forms a disordered arrangement of silver atoms. This work was supported by DGESIC under project PB98-0443-C02-01",
    "We study the fractional charge and statistics of elementary excitations in quantum spin systems with frustration, using exact diagonalization techniques for small clusters up to 12 sites. We find that the ground state is always gapped and has no degeneracy. The elementary excitations are fractionally charged fermions or bosons depending on whether the system is antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (F). In AF cases we also observe neutral fermionic excitations which carry zero electric charge but have nontrivial braiding properties. These results can be understood by mapping our models onto effective lattice gauge theories where the elementary excitations correspond to particles carrying flux quanta. Our work provides an explicit example of how fractional charges emerge naturally as topological defects in strongly correlated electronic materials. Introduction:-The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxide compounds [1] , together with other exotic phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance [2] , non-Fermi liquid behavior [3] etc., has led to renewed interest in understanding the physics of strongly interacting electrons. One of the most important open questions concerns the nature of the elementary excitations responsible for these novel behaviors [4] . It was suggested early on [5] that the elementary excitations may be described by some kind of collective modes known as spin waves [6] . However it soon became clear [7, 8] that this description fails at low energies due to strong electron correlations. More recently there has been considerable progress towards developing theoretical descriptions based on new concepts like fractionalized quasiparticles [9] , emergent gauge fields [10] , and topological order [11] .\nIn particular, recent experiments [12] suggest that the elementary excitations in the cuprates might indeed be described by some form of fractionalized quasiparticle [13] . This raises many interesting questions about their physical properties including their charge [14] , statistics [15] , and interactions [16] . Unfortunately, despite enormous efforts [17] , a complete microscopic theory describing all these aspects remains elusive [18] . A promising approach involves studying simplified model Hamiltonians [19, 20] whose low-energy limit captures essential features of the original problem [21] .",
    "The present work is devoted to the study of photon wave mechanics in terms of position eigenvectors, which are introduced as solutions of the Schrödinger equation for photons with an arbitrary energy spectrum. The concept of position eigenvector allows one to describe the state of a single photon by its position probability density distribution function (PDF). It also enables us to introduce the notion of quantum trajectory describing the evolution of this PDF over time. In particular, we show that the quantum trajectories corresponding to different initial states can be obtained from each other by means of unitary transformations. We demonstrate how these results may be used to analyze various phenomena related to the propagation of light through dispersive media. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our approach to the description of nonclassical effects associated with the emission of entangled pairs of photons. DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/aa5e20\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\n\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in developing new approaches to studying the properties of light fields based on the concepts of quantum optics [1–3] . One of such approaches involves introducing the so-called position eigenvectors [4] , which play an important role in the description of the state of a single-photon field [5–7] .\nIt should be noted that the use of position eigenvectors makes it possible not only to obtain information about the spatial structure of the electromagnetic field but also to investigate the temporal dynamics of the system under consideration [8, 9] . This fact opens up wide possibilities for applying the proposed method to analyzing various physical processes occurring during the propagation of light waves through dispersive media [10, 11] . \n \n In addition, the introduction of position eigenvectors into the theory of light fields leads to the possibility of using them to describe certain nonclassical effects associated",
    "We study the Catalan numbers in connection with the number of ways to realize a given triangulation as an ordered sequence of its diagonals, or equivalently, as a set of non-crossing diagonals. We show that this problem is related to counting certain types of Dyck paths. In particular we prove that for any positive integer n there are exactly C(n) different sequences of diagonals which can be realized by a convex quadrilateral having 2n sides. This result generalizes a theorem due to Motzkin and Straus on the number of diagonalizations of a convex polygon. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Catalan numbers count many combinatorial objects such as binary trees, noncrossing partitions, spanning trees, etc., see e.g.  [1, 2] . The present work deals with another class of Catalan-like objects: triangulations of polygons (see Figure 1 ). A triangulation T of a simple polygon P is defined as follows: it consists of all edges of P together with some additional diagonals connecting pairs of vertices of P so that each interior angle of P becomes at least 90 degrees after adding these diagonals. It follows immediately that every edge belongs to one and only one diagonal of T .\nIn [3] , Motzkin and Straus' celebrated theorem states that if D denotes the set of diagonals of a convex polygon Q then |D| = 2|Q|. They also proved that the number of diagonalizations d(P ) of a convex polygon P equals the number of diagonals of a triangulation of P . \nIt was shown recently [4] that the number of diagonals in a triangulation of a convex quadrilateral is equal to four times the number of diagonals needed to diagonalize the quadrilateral. Thus, the following question arises naturally: What is the relationship between the number of diagonals required to diagonalize a convex quadrilateral and the number of diagonals used in a triangulation?",
    "We present an algorithm to construct the reduced basis space in the context of nonlinear problems with multiple solutions, which is based on the concept of quasi-equilibrium grid (QEG). The QEG method was originally developed by Simo and Armero as a numerical technique for solving rate-independent processes such as plasticity or damage mechanics. We show that this approach can be used to generate snapshots for constructing the reduced basis spaces associated with nonlinear problems with multiple solutions. In particular, we consider two examples arising from structural dynamics and fluid flow computations. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method yields accurate approximations at significantly lower computational cost than existing approaches. Keywords: Reduced Basis Method; Quasi-Equilibrium Grids; Nonlinear Problems; Model Order Reduction; Geometric Construction; Snapshot Generation. 1 Introduction.\nThe goal of this work is to develop efficient algorithms for generating snapshots for constructing the RB spaces associated with nonlinear problems having multiple solutions. This problem arises frequently when one solves engineering applications involving complex physical phenomena such as multiphysics coupling, material failure, contact/impact, etc.. For example, in structural dynamics, it may happen that different initial conditions lead to different equilibrium states [19, 20] . Similarly, in fluid flows, there are often many steady-state solutions corresponding to different boundary conditions [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] .\nIn order to solve these types of problems efficiently using the reduced basis method (RBM), it is necessary to have a good set of snapshots representing all possible solution behaviors. However, since each snapshot corresponds to a specific solution behavior, it is not easy to obtain them directly through standard finite element analysis. Therefore, various techniques have been developed over the past decade to overcome this difficulty [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40",
    "We study the critical behavior of the 3D RFIM with Gaussian distributed disorder by means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. We find that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at zero temperature, which is characterized by an infinite correlation length but no divergent susceptibility. The results are compared to those obtained for the pure 3D Ising model as well as other models with quenched disorder. In particular we show how our findings can be understood within the framework of the droplet picture. \nPACS numbers: 64.60.Cn, 64.60.J-, 64.60.Nz \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been introduced more than 50 years ago [1] . It describes a ferromagnetic material where each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbors via exchange interactions J ij , while it also feels an external magnetic field h i randomly oriented on different sites [2] .\nIn recent years there have been many studies devoted to this problem both experimentally [3] - [6] and theoretically [7] - [12] . This interest was triggered mainly by the fact that the RFIM shares some features with real systems such as diluted antiferromagnets or spin-glasses [13] - [15] . For example, the presence of quenched disorder leads to frustration effects [16] similar to those observed in spin-glass materials [17] . Moreover, the RFIM displays a rich variety of phases depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field [18] . At low fields one finds a paramagnetic phase, whereas above a certain threshold value H c = O(J), the spins align along the direction of the local magnetic field leading to a ferromagnetic state [19] . Finally, if the magnitude of the external field exceeds another threshold value H t > H c , the magnetization becomes discontinuous [20] . These three regimes are separated by two second-order transitions occurring at T c1 < 0 and T c2 > 0 [21] . However, despite these analogies between the RFIM and experimental systems [22] , the exact nature of the phase diagram remains controversial [23] .",
    "We present an approach for self-organization in networks based on multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed method is applied to two different networks: one with mobile nodes and another with static ones, both using IEEE 802.11b as their communication protocol. In this work we use agents that are able to move between neighboring nodes, which allows them to collect information about the state of each node. This information can be used by other agents to make decisions such as: moving to new positions or changing the transmission power level. We have implemented our proposal in NS-2 simulator and compared it against three well-known algorithms: OLSR, AODV and DSR. Our results show that MAS outperforms these protocols in terms of: packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.

    "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest funder of biomedical research in the United States, but it also supports non-biomedical research through its extramural program.  The NIH has funded thousands of scientists at hundreds of institutions across the country to conduct basic science research that may have important applications outside of medicine.   This study examines how these researchers are using their NIH funding for non-biomedical projects by analyzing data collected during interviews with them conducted as part of an ongoing longitudinal survey of NIH-funded investigators.  We find that many of these scientists use their NIH funds primarily or exclusively for non-biomedically related research activities such as teaching, administration, and service work.  However, we also find that some scientists who receive NIH support for non-biomedics-related research still spend most of their time conducting biomedically focused research.  In addition, our results show that scientists' perceptions about whether they are spending more time doing biomedically versus non-biomedically focused research do not always match up with actual behavior.",
    "We present the results on diffuse optical light (DOL) correlations with cluster properties for a sample of galaxy clusters observed by the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys and Spitzer Infrared Array Camera. We find that DOL correlates positively with X-ray luminosity, temperature, mass, velocity dispersion, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect flux decrement at 1.4 GHz. The correlation between DOL and X-ray luminosity is stronger than those found previously using ground-based data. These results suggest that DOL traces hot gas in galaxy clusters.

    "We study the properties of strong peak points in Banach spaces, which are defined as follows.  Let X be a real or complex normed space with dual space X*. A point x # X is called a strong peak point if there exists an f # S(X) such that |f (x)| = sup{|f (y)| : y # X}. We prove that every separable reflexive Banach space has a dense set of strong peak points. As applications we show that every separable reflexivizable Banach space contains a copy of c 0 , and that every separable superreflexive Banach space contains a subspace isomorphic to l p for some 1 < p < + . In this note we study the properties of strong peaks points in Banach spaces. The concept was introduced by J. Lindenstrauss [L] who proved that every separable reflexible Banach space has a nonempty set of strong peak points; see also [JL1] .\nIn Section 2 we give several equivalent characterizations of strong peak points. In particular, it turns out that a point x # X is a strong peak point if and only if there exist two sequences (a n ) and (b n ) in R satisfying lim n Ä a n = lim n Ä b n = 1 and lim n Ä a n &1Â2 b n = 0 such that the sequence (a n b n ) converges weakly to zero but not strongly. This characterization enables us to prove our first main result on the density of strong peak points in separable reflexive BanACH spaces. \nTheorem 3. Every separable reflexive BanACH space has a dense set SP(X) of strong peak points.\n\nAs immediate consequences of Theorem 3 we obtain the following results. (i) Every separable reflexivizable space contains a copy of c0.\n(ii) Every separable superreflexive space contains a subspace isomorphic",
    "We present new results on the color magnitude distribution (CMD) of field galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<3, based on deep optical imaging data obtained with Subaru/Suprime-Cam at the prime focus telescope of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. We use two different samples for our analysis; one is a sample of about 12000 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), which covers an area of ~10deg2 around the North Galactic Pole (NGP). The other is a sample of about 10000 photometrically selected galaxies over an area of ~30deg2 centered on the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S).\nThe CMD shows that there are three distinct galaxy populations in terms of their rest-frame colors as well as luminosities. These are: red-sequence early-type galaxies, green valley late-type galaxies, and blue cloud star-forming galaxies. In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z. On the other hand, less-massive galaxies continue forming stars until today, resulting in larger fractions of blue cloud galaxies at lower redshifts.",
    "The polaron problem is one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics, and has been studied extensively for many years.  In this work we present an overview of some recent results on path integral methods applied to the su(2)-schrieffer-heeger (s-shh) model with periodic boundary conditions.   We first review how the s-shh hamiltonian can be written as a sum over spinless fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transformation.  Then we discuss how the partition function may be evaluated by performing a trace over all possible states of these fermions.  Finally, we show that the resulting expression can be rewritten in terms of Feynman diagrams which are then used to calculate various physical quantities such as the energy spectrum or correlation functions. The polaron problem is one o fthe most important problems in condensate matter physics, and has b een studied extensively for many years [1] .

    "The authors describe how they have created an artificial life form that self-assembles into a structure similar to the fruiting body of the Dictyostelium discoideum, or \"dictyos\" for short.  The dictyos is made up of thousands of identical cells connected by elastic filaments and can be grown in Petri dishes with nutrients added.   It has been shown to grow and divide indefinitely without any external control signals (such as hormones).   This work was done at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.   ... Self-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of matter into ordered structures such as crystals, snowflakes, and living organisms like bacteria colonies and animal tissues. In this study we report on our efforts toward creating a synthetic multicellular system capable of autonomous growth and division through self-assembly. We designed a minimal cell based on a spherical water-in-oil emulsion droplet containing a single microtubule-based cytoskeleton surrounded by a lipid membrane. These cells are able to attach to each other via flexible polymeric tethers and assemble into three-dimensional aggregates called “dictyos” which resemble the fruiting bodies formed by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoidium.

    "The structural relaxation and the local vibrational modes (LVMs) are investigated by first-principles calculations for the substituted system Mg1-xCrxAl2-xO4 with x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 at%. The results show that the substitution of Al3+ ions by Cr3+ leads to an increase in volume as well as a decrease in the unit cell parameters. In addition, we find that there is no significant change in the bond lengths between nearest-neighboring atoms when the concentration of Cr3+ increases up to 5%. However, it can be seen clearly that the bond length between second-nearest neighboring atoms decreases gradually with increasing Cr3+ content. Furthermore, our calculated phonon dispersion curves indicate that all the LVMs are stable except those along the Γ-X direction which become unstable above 1% Cr3+ doping.",
    "We present an efficient method for computing the vacuum energy and force between two parallel plates using only standard numerical electromagnetism methods, without resorting to any approximations or special treatments such as analytic continuation into complex frequencies. The key idea is that we can use the Feynman-Kac formula to express the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor at finite temperature T = 1/β (where β is the inverse temperature) in terms of the corresponding quantity at zero temperature but with one additional term involving the time evolution operator over a period of length β . We then show how this expression may be evaluated efficiently by expressing it in terms of the Green's function of Maxwell's equations on a periodic domain. This allows us to compute the vacuum energy and force exactly within our computational framework, which consists of solving the vector wave equation numerically on a rectangular grid. Our results are compared against those obtained previously using other approaches, including analytic continuation into complex frequencies and the PFA.",
    "We present an analysis of the transition between first stars and second stars, which are formed by gravitational collapse of primordial gas clouds with masses ranging from 10^4 M_sol to 10^6 M_sol.  We show that the formation rate of second stars is suppressed at redshifts z < 20 due to photoheating effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The suppression factor increases as redshift decreases because the IGM temperature rises more rapidly than its density. At lower redshifts, we find that the formation rates of both first and second stars increase sharply when the universe becomes reionized. This effect occurs because the ionizing photons produced during reionization heat up the surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms, thereby increasing their Jeans mass and suppressing fragmentation into smaller objects. Finally, we estimate the number densities of first and second stars using our model for star formation history. Our results suggest that second stars may be detectable via future surveys such as LSST or Euclid.",

    "The author describes how he has used the concept of \"errors in thinking\" to help students understand and learn about science, particularly physics.  He explains that this approach is based on his own experience as an undergraduate student at Harvard University where he was taught by Professor Richard Feynman.   The author suggests that it may be useful for teachers to use similar approaches when teaching other subjects such as mathematics or chemistry. The author also discusses some of the difficulties associated with using this method. This article appeared originally in Physics Today (Vol. 51 No. 1 January 1997). It can be downloaded from: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9701001v1.pdf  In order to teach physics effectively, one must first have a clear understanding of what constitutes good thinking within the subject area. Unfortunately, many people who are not trained scientists do not think like physicists; they tend to make mistakes which often lead them astray. For example, if asked whether two objects will fall together towards earth's center of mass, most people would say no because they believe that gravity acts only between bodies that touch each other. However, according to Newtonian mechanics, gravitational attraction does act upon all matter regardless of its position relative to another body. If you were to ask someone else why two objects don't fall together, she might answer that they are connected by a string so their weight cancels out. Although this explanation seems reasonable, it fails to take into account the fact that the force exerted by the string is negligible compared to the forces acting upon both objects individually. As a result, her reasoning is flawed.",
    "We present the discovery and analysis of two double neutron stars (DNSs) with masses in excess of 2 M_sun, PSR J0737-3039A/B and PSR B1913+16. The former is an eclipsing system that has been observed to undergo orbital decay at a rate consistent with gravitational wave emission; it will merge within about 3 Myr. The latter consists of a pulsar orbiting around its companion's helium core after having ejected most of its hydrogen-rich envelope during mass transfer on the red giant branch. We argue that these systems provide evidence for two different formation mechanisms for DNSs: one where both components are formed through normal stellar evolution, and another where only one component forms via this process while the other is born as a black hole or massive white dwarf. This second mechanism may be responsible for some short gamma-ray bursts. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.76.084011",
    "We propose that the Standard Model gauge fields are pseudo-goldstone bosons associated with spontaneous breaking of local non-abelian symmetry, and show how this can be implemented in an effective field theory framework. We also discuss possible experimental signatures for such a scenario at future colliders. The Standard Model (SM) is one of the most successful theories ever developed to describe physics phenomena observed over many orders of magnitude ranging from subatomic particles to cosmological scales. However, there remain several open questions about its fundamental structure which motivate searches beyond SM predictions. In particular, it has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics that the SM Lagrangian does not respect all Poincaré symmetries [1] . This fact leads to violations of Lorentz invariance predicted by the SM but never seen experimentally [2] .\nIn recent years, interest in models where some or all of these symmetries are broken spontaneously has increased [3] , motivated primarily by the possibility of explaining small neutrino masses via seesaw mechanisms [4] . These models typically involve new heavy fermions whose interactions break explicitly the global symmetry responsible for protecting the massless nature of the SM vector bosons [5] . As a result, the latter acquire tiny masses through radiative corrections [6] while still preserving their longitudinal polarization states [7, 8] .",
    "We present the results of our study on the evolution of interstellar dust (ISD) in spiral and irregular galaxies with various morphologies, based on multiwavelength observations obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), Herschel Space Observatory (HSO), Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have used SED fitting to derive physical parameters such as stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), age, extinction etc., for all sample galaxies using photometric data available at UV-optical-NIR wavelengths. The derived properties are then compared between two galaxy samples -one consisting of spirals and another one containing irregulars. Our main findings are:  1. Irregular galaxies show higher values of total infrared luminosity than their spiral counterparts.  2. Infrared excess emission is found to be more prominent in irregular galaxies when compared to that observed in spiral galaxies.  3. Dust temperature distribution shows significant differences among irregular and spiral galaxies.",
    "We present the results of dust formation calculations for supernova ejecta using a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code coupled with an equilibrium chemistry network, including grain growth by accretion onto pre-existing grains as well as coagulation between grains. We find that dust can form efficiently at temperatures below 1000 K if there is sufficient carbon available to make amorphous carbon grains. The amount of dust formed depends on the initial composition of the gas; we show that it increases dramatically when oxygen-rich material is mixed into the ejecta. For typical conditions found in Type II SNe, we predict that 0.1 M⊙ of dust forms within 10 years after explosion. This dust survives destruction due to sputtering by ions accelerated during the reverse shock passage through the ejecta. Our results suggest that dust may be produced in significant amounts in some core-collapse supernovae. \n \n Keywords: Dust, Supernova",
    "We report scanning magnetoresistance microscopy (SMRM) measurements on an atom chip with gold wires and microtraps fabricated by focused ion beam milling. The SMRM images show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures, which are used to transport cold atoms between different trapping sites. We find that the magnetic fields generated by these wires can be accurately described using Biot-Savart's law for straight current-carrying conductors. In addition we observe small deviations from this model at distances below 100 nm from the surface of the wires. These deviations may arise due to stray currents induced in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the wires close to their surfaces. Our results demonstrate that SMRM is well suited to study complex magnetic field distributions near microscopic objects such as atom chips. Atom chips have been developed over recent years as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter waves [1, 2] . They consist of arrays of metallic wires and microtraps produced by focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling [3] , where ultracold atoms are transported along the wires before being trapped in the microtraps [4] .\nIn order to optimize the performance of atom chips it is important to understand how the magnetic fields created by the wires affect the motion of the atoms. This requires detailed knowledge about the spatial structure of the magnetic fields around the wires. However, direct measurement techniques like SQUID-based magnetometry [5] cannot resolve the magnetic field distribution inside the wires because they are too thin [6] . Therefore indirect methods based on imaging the trajectories of atoms released from traps [7, 8] or measuring the forces acting on them [9] were employed instead. Recently, scanning Hall probe microscopy was applied to measure the local magnetic field strength [10] . Here we present scanning magnetoresistance microscopy [11] data obtained on an atom chip consisting of two parallel gold wires connected via a junction [12] . By comparing our experimental results with theoretical predictions we obtain information about the magnetic field distribution in proximity of the wires.",
    "We present an efficient algorithm for computing the sign function of a large sparse complex matrix, which is based on the Lanczos bidiagonalization process with partial reorthogonalization. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any Hermitian or non-Hermitian matrices without restriction. We apply this new algorithm to the overlap Dirac operator in lattice QCD simulations at finite density. In particular we show that our algorithm works well even when the quark mass becomes small compared to the inverse of the lattice spacing.

However, it suffers from the so-called \"sign problem\": the fermion determinant detDm=exp[-tr{Dm}lnm] changes its signs depending on the gauge configurations [2] , where Dm denotes the Wilson-Dirac operator [3] . Therefore, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly employed to calculate physical quantities using LQCD because they require positive definite weight functions [4] .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, several approaches have been developed so far [5] - [8] . Among them, the Taylor expansion approach [9] - [11] seems to be very powerful since it allows us to evaluate the expectation value of any observables accurately within statistical errors. It also enables us to perform calculations at high temperature and/or high density [12] - [14] . For example, the Taylor expansion up to O(a6) has already been performed successfully [15] .",
    "We present the first comprehensive study of visible spectroscopy for all known Jupiter trojans (JTs). We obtained high-resolution spectra with Subaru/HDS, Gemini/GNIRS, and Keck/NIRC-2 in order to determine their surface compositions. The sample includes 49 JTs including two new discoveries by our team. Our analysis shows that most JTs are S-complex asteroids or C-type asteroids. However, we found four objects which show unusual spectral features; one is an E-type asteroid, while three others have featureless red-sloped continuum. These objects may be primitive bodies such as carbonaceous chondrites. In addition, we find that some JTs belong to dynamically cold families. This suggests that these families were formed recently through catastrophic collisions among parent bodies. Finally, we discuss possible formation scenarios for JTs based on our findings.

    "We report on the detection of X-ray flares in low mass stars (0.5-0.8 M⊙) with ages between 1 and 10 Myr, located within the Orion Nebula Cluster. The flare activity is found to be strongly dependent upon stellar age; we find that younger stars are more active than older ones by at least an order of magnitude. We also find evidence for a dependence of flaring rate on rotation period, such that faster rotating stars have higher rates of flaring.  These results suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in regulating the level of coronal activity in young solar-type stars. This work was supported under NASA contract NAS8-39073.

    "We consider the asymptotic behavior of the sample autocovariance function and spectral density functions of stationary processes with regularly varying marginal distributions, which are driven by an infinite order moving average process whose coefficients have regularly varying tails. We show that these quantities can be approximated by those of a finite order autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model in the sense of weak convergence under some conditions on the tail behaviors of the ARMA parameters. The results obtained here extend previous ones given in the literature to more general cases where the driving noise is not necessarily Gaussian or has non-Gaussian components. In particular, we provide new proofs for the existing results when the driving noise is purely Gaussian. Our approach relies heavily on recent developments made in the theory of regular variation and stochastic calculus. As applications, we study two examples of duration-driven LRD models, namely the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and the Vasicek model.",

    "We present new near-infrared polarimetric observations of the equatorial ring surrounding the evolved star HD 163296 (HR 5171 A). The data reveal that the ring is highly polarized at infrared wavelengths with an average polarization fraction of ~20%. We find no evidence for significant changes to this value over time scales ranging from years to decades. This result suggests that dust grains are not being destroyed or created on short timescales within the ring. In addition, we detect a small degree of circularly polarized light emerging from the central region of the ring which may be due to scattering off non-spherical particles such as ice crystals. \n \n We also report results from our analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope images showing that the ring has remained remarkably stable since its discovery more than 20 years ago. Finally, we discuss how these findings can be used to constrain models of bipolar nebulae formation. Keywords: Polarization; Circumstellar matter",
    "We present deep radio observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA towards two TeV gamma-ray emitting regions, one associated to the open cluster Cyg OB2 #8 (HESS J1640-465) and another located near the massive star WR 25 (HESS J1641-463). The new data reveal extended emission around both TeV sources which is not detected by previous surveys. We discuss possible scenarios for this emission based on our results as well as those obtained recently by other authors. In particular we propose that the observed structures are due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven by stellar winds interacting within these clusters. This scenario would also explain why no X-ray counterparts have been found so far despite deep searches carried out with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Finally, we estimate the magnetic field strength required to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Cygnus OB2 association contains more than 100 OB stars distributed over an area of about 50 square degrees centered at l = 80°and b = 1° (  Fig.   1a ). It has been suggested that many of them could be members of binary systems or even multiple systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010) . These objects can drive powerful winds into their surroundings creating strong shocks where particles may be accelerated up to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shock fronts they will interact with photons coming from the surrounding interstellar medium producing high-energy electromagnetic radiation detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV range. \n \n Several studies suggest that several of the known TeV sources in the sky might be related to young open clusters like Cyg OB2 (see e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a ,b, 2007a . However, only few of these associations have been confirmed through multi-wavelength campaigns involving optical/infrared imaging, spectroscopy and/or radio continuum observations (see e.g. , Reimer & Böttcher 2006 , Castro-Tirado et al",
    "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has recently reported evidence for a new particle with mass around 125 GeV, consistent with Standard Model expectations for the Higgs boson.  The D0 collaboration at Fermilab is also searching for this signal in its data set and has presented results on the search for single top quarks produced via t-channel exchange of a virtual W-boson as well as s-channel production through gluon fusion.   In both cases we find no significant excess over background predictions. We present our results here along with those from other experiments that have searched for similar signals. The CMS experiment at the LHC has recently reported evidence for an unexpectedly light scalar resonance decaying to pairs of photons or leptons [1] . This observation is compatible with the Standard Model expectation for the Higgs boson [2] , which would be expected to weigh about 126 GeV [3] .\nIn addition to the standard model Higgs boson searches performed by ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] , there are many extensions of the SM [6] that predict additional scalars [7, 8] . These models can lead to deviations from the SM prediction for the Higgs boson properties [9] such as spin [10] , parity [11] , CP [12] , coupling strengths [13] , branching ratios [14] , etc.. Many of these scenarios involve heavy particles that may be pair-produced at hadron colliders [15] . However, some theories [16] suggest that the Higgs-like state could be singlet under SU(2), U(1). Such states cannot be directly produced in pairs but only appear in association with another quark [17] . For example, in supersymmetric models [18] , the Higgs-like state appears in association with b-quarks [19] . Other examples include composite [20] and Little-Higgs [21] models where the Higgs-like state couples preferentially to third generation fermions [22] .",
    "We consider the problem of optimal investment in a financial market when there is no upper bound on the investor's wealth, but his/her utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA). We show that under DARA preferences, the value function for this problem can be characterized as the unique solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) which we call the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs PDE. This characterization allows us to use standard numerical methods such as finite difference or Monte Carlo simulation to compute the value function numerically. In addition, it also enables us to study how the optimal strategy depends on various parameters including the initial endowment, the interest rate, and the volatility of the stock price process. Finally, by using our results, we are able to provide some new insights into the relationship between pricing and hedging derivatives based on utility maximization principles. The main contributions of this work include:",
    "The low energy effective theories for superstrings are supergravity and supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions, which can be obtained by compactifying the extra six spatial dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold.  In this talk I will discuss some recent results about lattice models that provide an alternative approach to studying these theories. The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms. Recently we developed new Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the worm algorithm that allow us to simulate large systems at very high temperatures where conventional Monte Carlo methods fail because they suffer from critical slowing down. We used our new method to calculate the free energies of several different supersymmetric lattice models including the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the N = 1 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory coupled to matter fields in various representations.",
    "We present the results of numerical simulations of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium for solar prominences embedded into non-potential, sheared and twisted coronal fields. The model is based on solving numerically the Grad-Shafranov equation with boundary conditions at both ends of the computational domain that are derived using an approximate analytical solution to this problem. We find that the resulting equilibria have shapes similar to those observed in white-light coronagraph images. In particular, we show how the shape of the prominence changes as its position relative to the underlying photospheric magnetic flux distribution varies. Our results also demonstrate that the presence of shear and/or twist leads to significant deviations from potential-field models commonly used in theoretical studies of prominences. These findings may be useful for interpreting observations of prominences made by space-based instruments such as SDO/AIA. \n \n Keywords: Solar prominence, Magnetohydrostatics",
    "We study the problem of finding an optimal set of points on the unit circle that are equidistant to each other and have minimum angular separation between them, known as the Costas array or Costas configuration.  We show how this problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints over the space of probability measures supported by the unit circle. This formulation allows us to use tools from convex analysis for solving it efficiently. In particular we provide a polynomial time algorithm which computes an approximate solution within any desired accuracy. The proposed method is based on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm combined with the Sinkhorn-Knopp scaling technique. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach compared to existing methods.

    "The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most famous problems in combinatorial optimization, which asks for finding an optimal tour through all vertices of a given graph such that each edge is visited exactly once. In this work we study TSP on graphs with special structure called Hamiltonian graphs. We show how to solve TSP optimally on these graphs by using dynamic programming. Moreover, we present some new results about Hamiltonicity testing algorithms based on our approach. The traveling salesman problem (also known as the travelling salesperson or salesman's route problem) is one of the best-known problems in combinatorial optimization. It can be formulated as follows: Given a complete weighted undirected graph G = (V , E), find a cycle C passing through every vertex v ∈ V at least once so that the total weight w(C ) of edges in C is minimized. This problem has been studied extensively since its formulation more than 50 years ago.",
    "In this work, we study the throughput capacity region for multi-hop wireless networks with multiple transmitters and one receiver (MISO-MHWN). We first show that the MISO-MHWN is equivalent to an interference channel where each transmitter has only one antenna but can communicate simultaneously with all receivers in the network. Then, by using the concept of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), which characterizes how many parallel data streams are supported at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we derive outer bounds on the DoF region of the MISO-MHWNS. Finally, based on these results, we propose a novel transmission scheme called \"Interference Alignment\" (IA) to achieve the optimal DoF region. The proposed IA scheme exploits both spatial multiplexing gain as well as multiuser diversity gain. In particular, it allows different users to transmit their signals over non-overlapping time-frequency resources while maintaining full spatial reuse among them.",
    "The present work is devoted to the investigation of new possible nuclear properties using nonlinear methods, namely fractal dimension (FD) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The FD was calculated for different mass number A in order to study its dependence on the system size. It has been found that there exists an optimal value of the scaling parameter which provides the best results for each nucleus separately. This fact indicates that the structure of the studied systems can be characterized as multifractals with non-trivial behavior. In addition we have shown that the obtained values are very close to those predicted by the percolation theory. We also applied RQA method to investigate the temporal evolution of the considered systems. Our calculations show that the complexity of the time series increases with increasing mass number A. Moreover it turns out that this increase follows closely the predictions made within the framework of the Random Matrix Theory. Finally we have compared our results with experimental data available for some light nuclei.",
    "We study how galactic discs warp in response to tidal forces exerted by dark matter haloes and intergalactic gas filaments, using high-resolution cosmological simulations with radiative cooling and star formation. We find that the majority (>80%) of simulated galaxies have significant warping at z = 0. The amplitude of the warp increases with decreasing galaxy mass, but is independent of redshift for massive galaxies. Warp amplitudes are typically less than 10 kpc, which agrees well with observations. Our results suggest that most observed warps can be explained as being caused by external gravitational torques on galactic discs. This implies that there may not exist any intrinsic mechanism within galactic discs themselves that causes warps. In addition, we show that the presence of an AGN does not significantly affect the shape or strength of the warp. Finally, we demonstrate that our model predicts a correlation between the direction of the warp and the angular momentum vector of the host halo.",
    "We propose a model that describes the spontaneous formation of neuronal assemblies in terms of an unsupervised Hebbian learning rule with synaptic depression. The network is composed by N neurons connected to each other through excitatory connections whose strength depends on their firing rate according to a depressing function. We show how this mechanism leads to the emergence of stable states characterized by different levels of average activity and number of synchronized clusters. In particular we find that there exists a critical value of the connection probability above which the system undergoes a phase transition towards a state where all neurons are synchronously firing at high rates. This regime corresponds to what has been observed experimentally as ictal seizures. \n \n Moreover, we study the effect of external stimulation on the dynamics of our network. By applying brief electrical pulses to specific groups of neurons we can induce transitions between different dynamical regimes. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these results to neurobiology.",
    "We present the results of an analysis to determine whether physical vetoes can be used as part of a pipeline to reduce false alarms in searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole mergers and other astrophysical sources.  We use data collected by the LIGO detectors during their fifth science run, which took place between September 2005 and January 2007. The search pipeline is based on matched filtering with template waveforms that are generated using post-Newtonian expansions up to 3PN order. In addition to standard cuts applied to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we also apply two different types of physical vetoes:  1) Vetoing events whose SNRs exceed some threshold value when they occur simultaneously at multiple detector sites; 2) Vetoing events where there is evidence of excess power above background noise levels in the frequency bands below 100 Hz or above 1000 Hz. For each type of veto, we define a set of parameters that control its effectiveness. Using these parameters, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to study how well the vetoes reject simulated signals injected into real detector data. Our main result shows that both types of physical vetoes significantly improve our ability to detect GW signals while keeping the number of false positives low.",
    "The human genome is organized into chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins and other associated factors. The folding of the chromatin fiber plays an important role in regulating gene expression by controlling access of transcription machinery to genes. In this review we discuss recent advances on how chromatin folds at different levels (from single nucleosome to chromosome) and its relation with human genome function. We also introduce some new concepts such as \"topological domains\" and \"chromosome territories\" that are emerging from high-throughput technologies. Finally, we provide examples for future research directions. Chromatin is the basic unit of eukaryotic chromosomes consisting of DNA wrapped around histones and other associated factors. It has been shown that chromatin structure plays an important role in regulation of gene expression through control of accessibility of transcription machinery to genes [1] . Recent studies have revealed that chromatin fibers fold into higher-order structures ranging from 30 nm fibers [2] , loops [3] , topologically associating domains [4] , and chromosome territories [5] .\nIn this review, we will first briefly describe the organization of chromatin fibers at various scales. Then we will focus on the relationship between chromatin folding and human genome functions including gene regulation, replication, repair, and recombination. Finally, we will give several examples for possible future research directions.",
    "We consider the problem of designing distributed consensus algorithms in sensor networks where links are randomly generated and can be lost or added over time. We propose an algorithm that is robust to link failures, but requires only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm achieves global convergence under mild conditions on network topology. In particular, we show that if each node has at least one neighbor whose degree is greater than its own then our algorithm converges almost surely (a.s.) to the correct value. Our results also hold when there exists a small number of Byzantine nodes which may deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed behavior. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords: Sensor Networks; Distributed Consensus; Local Information Exchange; Robustness Analysis. 1 Introduction Distributed consensus problems arise naturally in many applications such as flocking [1] , formation control [2] , multi-agent coordination [3] , wireless sensor networks [4] , etc.. A typical example is the average-consensus problem: given a set of n agents connected by communication links, each agent holds some initial data xi(0) ∈ Rm, i = 1, ..., n; it aims to compute the average x̄=1/n∑in=1xi(0). This problem was first studied by Tsitsiklis et al. [5] . They showed that if all agents have access to the same fixed directed graph G, then the average-consensus problem can be solved using a simple linear iterative scheme. However, this assumption does not always hold true since the underlying communication graphs are often random due to unreliable links [6] .\nIn recent years, several researchers have investigated the design of distributed consensus algorithms in dynamic networks [7-10]. For instance, Olfati-Saber [7] considered the case where the communication links among agents change randomly according to independent Bernoulli processes. Under certain assumptions on the connectivity of the network, she proved that her algorithm converges almost surely (i.e., with probability one) to the desired average. Subsequently, Jadbabaie et al. [8] extended these results to undirected networks. More recently,",
    "We study the orbital magnetization (OM) induced by spin-orbit coupling on a kagome lattice with chiral magnetic order, which is realized as an emergent property of the system at low temperatures. We show that the OM can be expressed in terms of the Berry curvature associated with the band structure near the Fermi level. The magnitude of the OM depends strongly on the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the direction of the applied field. In particular, we find that when the external field points along one of the three equivalent <111> directions, there are two peaks in the temperature dependence of the OM. These results suggest that the OM may provide useful information about the nature of the ordered state in this material. \n \n Introduction \n \n Orbital magnetization (OM), also known as orbital polarization or orbital moment density, has been studied extensively for many years both theoretically [1]-[3] and experimentally [4]-[6] . It arises due to the presence of spin-orbit interactions [7][8][9] , and it plays important roles in various physical phenomena such as topological insulators [10] - [12] , quantum Hall effect [13] , and superconductivity [14] . Recently, the OM was observed in several materials including SrRuO3 [15] , La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 [16] , YbMgGaO4 [17] , and FeSe [18] .\n \nIn this work, we consider the case where the OM appears in a frustrated antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice [19][20][21] [22] . This type of magnetic ordering occurs naturally in some compounds like Herbertsmithite [23] , ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 [24] , and CuFeO2 [25] . However, these systems have relatively weak spin-orbit couplings compared to other transition metal oxides [26] . Therefore, they do not exhibit large values of the OM [27] . On the other hand, recently discovered iron-based pnictide/chalcogenide compounds [28] - [30] possess strong spin-orbit interactions [31] , but their magnetic structures remain controversial [32] - [35] . Thus, our theoretical investigation provides valuable insight into possible experimental realiz",
    "The standard model (SM) is the most successful theory in particle physics, but it has some problems such as hierarchy problem and CP violation.

The Yukawa couplings are given by \nwhere  is the Higgs vacuum expectation value,  is the mass matrix for fermions ,  is the CKM mixing matrix , and  is the Kobayashi-Maskawa(KM) matrix . We have two parameters in the KM matrix : one phase which causes CP violation and another parameter called Jarlskog invariant J = Im VudVub * / Re VudIm Vub .\nIn order to explain the observed CP violation in K meson system, we need at least one complex number in the KM matrix. However there are only four real numbers in the Yukawa coupling matrices. This means that we cannot determine all elements of the KM matrix uniquely. Therefore we introduce extra dimensions into our models so that we can obtain more degrees of freedom.",

    "The future evolution of the local large scale structure is investigated by using N-body simulations with different cosmological models, including dark energy (DE) and cold dark matter (CDM). The results show that in the Λ-CDM model without DE, the growth rate of large-scale structures decreases rapidly at late times due to the effect of CDM. In contrast, for the same initial conditions but with DE included, the growth rates are almost constant over time. This indicates that the inclusion of DE can significantly affect the formation of large-scale structures on very large scales. We also find that the density profiles of clusters formed in these two cases have significant differences. These results suggest that it may be possible to distinguish between these two scenarios through observations of cluster properties such as their mass functions or X-ray luminosities.

    "We present the results of our study on binary models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with progenitors in the mass range 8-40 M⊙, which are expected to produce GRB jets that can be observed at cosmological distances. We find that these systems evolve into double-degenerate binaries consisting of two white dwarfs or helium stars before they explode as supernovae. The explosion is triggered by the merger of the components due to gravitational wave emission. In some cases we also find that the system evolves through an intermediate stage where one component collapses to form a black hole while the other explodes as a supernova. This scenario may explain why there seems to exist a gap between the masses of ordinary core-collapse supernovae and those of GRBs. Our calculations show that the total number of such events per year could be up to 10 times higher than previously estimated if the progenitor population extends down to lower masses.",

The observed line profiles are consistent with an expanding shell model for the wind.

    "We present an analytical solution to the problem of bending thin elastic shells with variable thickness under surface loads, which is applicable to the case where the shell's thickness varies by several orders of magnitude over its radius and where the load distribution is not necessarily axisymmetric.  We show that in this case it is possible to obtain accurate results using only two parameters instead of three as was previously thought necessary (the third parameter being the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the shell's thickness). The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration. This makes our approach much faster than previous methods while retaining high accuracy. Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth's crust to tectonic stresses and other processes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition. It also has applications in geophysics beyond Earth sciences including planetary science, astrophysics and seismology. \nTheory\n\nIn order to study the deformation of the Earth's crust we need to know how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate boundary interactions like subduction zones and transform faults. To do so, we use the theory of elasticity to find solutions to problems involving the interaction between plates and their underlying mantle. However, solving these problems analytically requires simplifying assumptions about the geometry of the system and the mechanical properties of the materials involved. \n\nOne important simplification made when studying the mechanics of plate boundaries is to assume that they behave as if they were composed of thin elastic shells. These shells have been shown to provide good approximations to more realistic models of plate boundaries because they allow for rapid calculations of the stress fields within them. For example, Figure 1 shows a comparison between the predictions obtained using a simple spherical shell model and those produced by a finite element model of the San Andreas Fault System.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison between the predicted displacements along the San Andreas fault calculated using a spherical shell model (blue line) and a finite element model (red dots).",
    "We present the theory for anomalous diffusion in terms of fractional Fokker-Planck equations and apply it to study the time evolution of chemical reactions occurring on realistic self-affined fractals, such as porous media or biological tissues. We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*. For times larger than t* the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial condition and coincides with the one predicted by classical mean field theories. This result suggests that the dynamics of chemical reactions in complex environments may be described by simple models based only on geometrical information about the environment.",
    "In this work, we propose an encounter based worm interaction model to evaluate the performance of different node characteristics in terms of their ability to detect and prevent worms spreading over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). We consider two types of nodes with distinct capabilities for detecting and preventing worms: normal nodes that are vulnerable to infection by worms but can detect them using signature detection techniques; and immune nodes which have no vulnerability to worm infections but can prevent worm propagation through quarantine mechanisms. The proposed model is used to study how these two types of nodes interact when they meet each other during network operation. In particular, our results show that: 1) Immune nodes play a significant role in reducing the number of infected nodes as well as the total number of encounters between susceptible and infectious nodes; 2) Immune nodes should be deployed at strategic locations within MANETs; 3) Immune nodes should not only focus on quarantining infectious nodes but also on isolating suspicious nodes; 4) Immune nodes should use both signature detection and quarantine mechanisms simultaneously to achieve better performance against worm propagation; 5) Immune nodes should adopt dynamic quarantine strategies instead of static ones since static quarantine may lead to unnecessary isolation of legitimate nodes.",
    "The discovery space for astronomical research is vast, with many different types of surveys being conducted at all wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this talk I will discuss how wide field optical imaging surveys have been used to discover new classes of objects in our Universe such as quasars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, supernovae, gamma ray bursts etc., and also how these surveys are now providing data on dark energy which drives cosmic acceleration. The next generation of large area surveys (such as LSST) will provide an even greater volume of data that can be exploited by researchers worldwide. This talk will give examples of some recent results obtained using data from current and past surveys including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1), Dark Energy Survey (DES), VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy survey (VIKING).",
    "We relate the notion of information-theoretic security to that of computational indistinguishability, and show how this relationship can be used in practice for proving security properties of cryptographic protocols.  We also present an algorithm which transforms any protocol secure against passive adversaries into one secure against active ones (under some reasonable assumptions). The transformation preserves all communication complexity measures such as round-complexity or number of messages exchanged between parties.   Finally we give examples where our approach is useful by applying it to prove security of several well-known protocols. In recent years there has been much interest in developing techniques for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. One important goal is to develop tools for showing that certain protocols are secure with respect to various definitions of security. For example, many researchers have studied the problem of transforming a protocol secure only against passive attackers into one secure against active attackers. This problem was first considered by Canetti et al., who gave a general solution based on universal composability [Can01] . However their method does not preserve communication complexity measures like round-complexity or message-exchange patterns. Subsequently, Micali proposed another transformation [MIC02] , but his technique requires additional assumptions about the underlying primitives being used.",
    "We present the results of our analysis of U Gem, which is one of the brightest and most studied dwarf novae in outbursts. We have used all available photometric data to determine its ephemeris with an accuracy better than 0.1 s. The light curve shows that there are two maxima per orbit during quiescence as well as in outburst. This fact allows us to obtain accurate values of the mass ratio q = M2/M1 between the components of this binary system. Using these new values we can estimate the absolute masses of both stars (0.7 ± 0.05M⊙) and their radii (3.5 ± 0.2R⊙). These values agree very well with those obtained by other authors using different methods. \n \n Keywords: Dwarf Novae - Orbital Period Changes - Mass Ratio - Photometry - Ephemerides",
    "We study the ground-state properties of two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) quark matter at finite density and temperature by using an effective chiral model with vector interaction, which is derived from QCD under the mean-field approximation. We find that there exists a new type of 2SC phase where quarks are paired into diquark condensates with different colors but same flavor. This novel phase has been named as Larkin-Ovchinnikova-Fulde-Ferreell (LOFF) state because it was first proposed to describe superfluidity in nuclear systems. In this LOFF state, we show that the gap parameter for pairing between quarks with opposite momenta depends on their relative angle. The magnitude of the gap decreases rapidly when they move away from each other along the Fermi surface. As a result, the energy gap vanishes completely near the boundary of the Brillouin zone.",
    "We show that the exchange-only optimized potentials (OEPs) are not equivalent to the Kohn-Sham (KS) method in general, even if one uses an exact density functional for the exchangecorrelation energy. We demonstrate this by solving analytically the OEPs for two simple model systems using Gaussian-type orbitals as basis functions. The results obtained within both approaches differ significantly. In particular, we find that the KS approach yields incorrect values for the total energies of these systems. This is due to the fact that the KS equations do not have solutions corresponding to all possible densities which can be generated by the given basis sets. On the other hand, the OEP formalism always provides unique solutions for any given density matrix. Our analysis shows also how to resolve the apparent paradox arising when trying to apply the OEP formalism to the case where only a limited number of basis functions is used.",

    "Globular clusters are dense stellar systems that contain thousands to millions of stars, and may be the oldest gravitationally bound objects known.  The discovery of planets around other stars has raised questions about whether or not globular cluster members can also harbor planetary systems.   In this work we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine how many planets could exist within globular clusters with different masses and ages.  We find that for most reasonable assumptions on planet formation rates, there should be at least one planet per star in all but the youngest (<10 Myr) and lowest mass (<100 Msun) clusters.  This result is robust against uncertainties in our knowledge of planet formation efficiencies and initial conditions such as the number density distribution of planetesimals.  Our results suggest that it will be possible to detect planets orbiting globular cluster members using current observational techniques.

    "We discuss the gauge invariance properties of effective actions obtained by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, such as quarks and gluons, within supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We show that these actions are not generally invariant under local gauge transformations unless certain conditions on their form are satisfied. These results have important consequences for the construction of gauge-invariant observables in supersymmetric gauge theories. They also provide an explanation why it is possible to construct nontrivial superpotentials even though supersymmetry does not allow any explicit breaking terms at tree level. Finally we argue that our findings can be used to resolve some puzzling features observed recently in lattice simulations of N = 1 supersymmetric QCD with four flavors. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories play an important role both in particle physics and string theory. Their low-energy dynamics is described by an effective action which contains all quantum corrections due to the integration over heavy fields like quarks or gluons. This effective action has been studied extensively during recent years but many questions remain open concerning its precise structure. One particular issue concerns the question whether this action is gauge invariant. It was shown already more than twenty years ago [1] that if one integrates out only massive fermions then the resulting effective action is indeed gauge invariant. However, when including also massive bosonic degrees of freedom there exist counterexamples where the effective action fails to be gauge invariant [2] . Recently, this problem attracted renewed interest because of its relevance for the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories [3, 4] .\nIn this work we study the gauge invariance properties systematically using functional methods. Our main result is that the effective action is always gauge invariant up to total derivatives provided two conditions are met. First, the effective action must contain no higher-order time-derivatives acting on the gauge field. Second, the coefficients appearing in front of the various operators in the effective action should satisfy certain relations. For example, they cannot depend explicitly on the gauge coupling constant g. If either condition is violated then the effective action will fail to be gauge",
    "We present an effective method to conserve the total energy and linear momentum in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by introducing two types of potentials: one is used during the MD run, while another is only used when calculating the forces on particles at each time step. The latter type of potentials are switched off after being calculated so that they do not affect the subsequent MD trajectories. We show how this scheme can be implemented into existing MD codes with minimal modifications. In addition, we demonstrate its effectiveness through several examples including liquid argon, water clusters, and carbon nanotubes. Our results indicate that our new scheme conserves both energy and momentum very well even though it does not require any additional computational cost compared to conventional schemes.

    "We present the first supersymmetric generalization of the isometry group of string theory, which we call the hidden dimensions (HD) group.  The HD group contains all known symmetries of string theory as subgroups, including the Poincare symmetry in ten spacetime dimensions, the SO(32) gauge symmetry of heterotic strings, and the E8xE8 or SO(16)xSO(16) gauge symmetry of type IIA or IIB superstrings respectively.   We show that the HD group can be realized on any closed Riemann surface with genus g > 1 by constructing an explicit action for it on the space of conformal field theories associated to this surface.  This construction generalizes previous results obtained using orbifold techniques, but has several advantages over them.  In particular, our approach allows us to construct new models of string compactification without introducing extra massless states into the spectrum at tree level.   ...",
    "We study the semiclassical dynamics of electrons in magnetic fields, which are described by the Dirac equation with spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting. We show that the electron trajectories can be focused into narrow beams when their initial velocities have opposite directions along the field lines. This is due to an interference between two types of motion -the usual cyclotrons and the so-called \"Zitterbewegung\" oscillations-which leads to a beating pattern on top of the classical circular orbits. The latter type of motion arises because of the relativistic nature of the particles and its origin lies in the fact that the energy bands are spin split. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the physics behind phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect or the integer quantum Hall effect at high Landau levels. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of interacting fermions under strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been studied extensively over many years [1] . In particular, it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional filling factors [2] , where the number of filled Landau levels differs from the expected value [3] .\nIn this work we focus our attention on the case of non-interacting fermions moving in 2D space subject to a uniform magnetic field B = Be z [4] . For simplicity, we consider only one spin species; however, all our results remain valid if both spin projections are taken into account [5] . In addition, we assume that the Fermi level lies within the conduction band [6] . Under these conditions, the low-energy excitations around the Fermi surface are well-described by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian [7, 8] \nwhere v F denotes the Fermi velocity, σ i=x,y,z denote Pauli matrices acting on the spinor wave function Ψ(r), p x = −i∂/∂x and p y = −i∂/(−i∂y).

    "We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the in-plane structure, order parameters, and surface tension of liquid Na(l) in contact with vacuum or solid NaCl (001). We find that the density profile is strongly dependent on the presence of an underlying substrate; it exhibits a pronounced double peak for the case without substrate but becomes single-peaked when the substrate is present. The height fluctuations are found to be larger than those observed experimentally by STM measurements. This discrepancy may arise due to the fact that our simulation cell contains only one layer of liquid sodium atoms while experiments typically involve several layers. In addition, we observe that the average nearest neighbor distance decreases as the number of layers increases. Our results show that the in-plane structure of liquid sodium can be significantly influenced by its environment. Finally, we calculate the surface tensions using two different methods and compare them against each other.",
    "We present an overview of our recent work on Bayesian methods for reconstructing the large scale structures in the universe using galaxy redshift surveys. We discuss how to formulate this problem as a statistical inference task with priors that encode physical information about the underlying matter distribution. The posterior probability density function is then evaluated by applying Bayes' theorem together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. In particular we focus on two different approaches which are based either on Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally we describe some applications of these methods to simulated data sets. This research was supported by NSF grant AST-0707763. Cosmology has been revolutionized over the past decade by precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies made by WMAP [1] , PLANCK [2] and other experiments [3] . These observations have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark energy [4] and have led to tight constraints on many parameters describing the physics of the early universe [5] .\nHowever, despite their successes there remain several open questions regarding fundamental aspects of the standard model of cosmology [6] . One such question concerns the nature of dark matter [7, 8] : what is its particle content? What is its mass? How does it interact with ordinary matter?\nAnswering these questions requires detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of dark matter throughout space and time [9] . Unfortunately direct detection experiments [10] cannot provide this information because they only measure the gravitational effects of dark matter particles [11] . Instead one must rely on indirect probes like galaxy clustering [12] , weak lensing [13] and 21 cm emission [14] .",
    "The in vivo behavior of looped DNA-protein complexes is investigated by using multiscale modeling and simulation techniques. The results show that the looping process can be divided into three stages, namely initiation, elongation, and termination. During the initiation stage, the protein binds to its recognition site on one end of the double helix; during the elongation stage, it slides along the double helix until reaching another recognition site at which point the complex terminates. These findings are consistent with experimental observations. Furthermore, we find that the sliding motion of the protein is driven by thermal fluctuations rather than Brownian diffusion. Finally, our simulations suggest that the formation of loops may play an important role in regulating gene expression.

    "We report on observations made with the Submillimeter Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in order to study the kinematics of an outflow driven by the high-mass protostellar object, IRAS 18566+0408; this source is associated with a cluster of young stellar objects located at a distance of 3 kpc. The data reveal that there are two components along the line-of-sight; one component has a systemic velocity of ~10 km s-1 , while another component shows blueshifted emission up to -60 km s-1 . We find evidence for a collimated jet-like structure extending over ~0.5 pc. This suggests that the driving source may be deeply embedded within its natal cloud core. In addition, we detect several compact knots distributed along the flow axis which show blue-shifted velocities ranging between 10-60 km s-1 .\nThe mass-loss rate estimated from our observations ranges between 1×10-3 -1×10-2 M⊙ yr-1 .",
    "We propose an efficient numerical scheme to solve the nonlinear dynamics of semiconductor microcavity lasers with arbitrary pumping profiles and cavity losses, which is based on the combination of two different truncation schemes. The first one is used to reduce the number of equations by eliminating all but those that are relevant at any given time instant; this allows us to obtain accurate results even when only few modes contribute significantly to the total emission spectrum. The second one is applied to eliminate the fast oscillating terms appearing due to the presence of multiple longitudinal modes within each transverse mode family. We show how these two techniques can be combined into a single algorithm, which we call \"dynamics-controlled truncation\" (DCT). Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by comparing it against other existing methods. In particular, we consider three different types of pumping profiles: constant, periodic, and random pulsed pumping. \nI. INTRODU CTION\nSemiconductor microcavity lasers' attract considerable attention because they provide a promising route towards low-threshold laser sources [1] . However, their complex multimode nature makes them difficult to model numerically [2] , especially if the pumping profile or the cavity loss varies over time [3] .\nIn order to overcome such difficulties, several authors have proposed various approaches [4] - [8] . For example, in Ref. [6] , the authors use a reduced set of rate equations to describe the evolution of the slowly varying amplitudes of the dominant modes. This approach has been extended recently to include higher-order effects [7] as well as nonuniform gain saturation [9] . Another possibility consists in using truncated Fourier series expansions [10] , where the coefficients of the expansion are determined self-consistently [11] . Alternatively, one may also employ direct integration of Maxwell's equations [12] , although this requires very large computational resources [13] .",
    "We report the observation of very weak electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films grown on SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition, which is consistent with previous reports for bulk samples.  We also observe that EPC decreases as temperature increases up to 300 K. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of lattice expansion due to thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. In addition, we find that the magnitude of EPC depends strongly on film thickness; it becomes smaller when the film thickness decreases down to 10 unit cells. The observed dependence of EPC on both temperature and film thickness suggests that phonon confinement plays an important role in determining the strength of EPC in these materials. Manganese oxides have been extensively studied because they exhibit many interesting physical properties such as colossal magnetoresistance [1] , metal-insulator transition [2] , and charge ordering [3] . Among them, La1-xSrxMnO3 has attracted much attention since its discovery [4] .\nIn this compound, Mn ions are located at two different sites, i.e., Mn3+(tetrahedral site) and Mn4+(octahedral site). It was found that the magnetic ground state changes from ferromagnetic insulator to antiferromagnetic insulator upon increasing x [5] . These phenomena were attributed to the competition between double exchange interaction [6] and superexchange interaction [7, 8] . However, there still remain some open questions about the origin of the electronic states in these compounds [9] . For example, the mechanism responsible for the insulating nature of these materials remains controversial [10] .",
    "We prove that the set of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is uniquely representable as a sum of squares of rational functions, and we give an explicit algorithm for computing such representation.  We also show how to extend this result to multivariate polynomials over finite fields. The problem of representing a given polynomial as a sum of squares (SOS) has been studied extensively since Hilbert's 19th century work on quadratic forms. In particular, it was shown by Artin that every nonnegative integer can be represented as a sum of four squares of integers; see [1] . This theorem implies that any positive integer n can be written as a sum of at most 4 square roots of integers. However, there are infinitely many ways to write each number as a sum of two or three square roots of integers. For example, 1 = 2 + √ 3 , but also 1 = 2 − √ 3 .\nThe uniqueness question becomes more interesting when restricted to certain classes of polynomials. It turns out that if f ∈ Z[x] is a monic polynomial whose Galois group G(f ) is solvable then f is uniquely representable as SOS [2] . On the other hand, if G(f ) contains a nonsolvable subgroup then f may have several distinct SOS representations [3] .",
    "A slide-o-cam transmission is an alternative to conventional geared transmissions in which the input and output shafts are connected by means of cams that rotate on their own axes, with no gears or other mechanical elements between them.  The main advantages of this type of transmission are:  • No backlash due to tooth meshing; • High efficiency (up to 98%); • Low noise levels; • Reduced weight and volume compared to traditional gearboxes; • Easy assembly and disassembly; • Possibility of using different types of motors as inputs. This article presents some strategies for designing a slide-o-cam transmission based on the analysis of its kinematic characteristics. These strategies have been applied to develop two prototypes of slide-o-cam transmissions intended for use in electric vehicles. In addition, a mathematical model has been developed to simulate the behavior of these transmissions under various operating conditions. Finally, experimental tests were carried out to validate both the design process proposed here and the results obtained through simulation.",
    "The Web is an important source of information that can be used to support decision making processes and business intelligence applications.

The proposed method uses semantic technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Ontology Web Language). We also present how our approach can be integrated within a data warehouse system using ETL tools. Finally, we show some experimental results obtained by applying our approach to real world datasets.

A data warehouse [4] is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions. It provides users with fast access to historical data along with current operational data.

    "The purpose of this study is to investigate how privacy issues are perceived by users in Europe and what their attitude towards these issues is, when using online learning environments (OLE). The research questions are: \nWhat do students think about privacy?\nHow does student's perception change over time?\nWhich factors influence students' attitudes on privacy? How can we measure it? What are the implications for OLE developers? This article presents results from two surveys conducted with university students at different universities across Europe between 2004-2006. It shows that there has been little change in the way students perceive privacy since 2004. Students' concerns have not changed significantly either; they still worry most about personal information being shared without permission or control. However, some differences were found among countries. In addition, the findings show that gender plays a role as well as age.

    "We study the existence, uniqueness and ergodicity of physical measures in some classes of infinite measure preserving transformations on probability spaces. We prove that if T is an infinite measure preserving transformation on (X, B(X), m) such that there exists a set A ∈ B(X) satisfying m(A) > 0 and m(T −1 A) = 0 then T has at least one physical measure which is unique up to scalar multiples. Moreover we show that any two physical measures are equivalent under suitable conditions. Finally we give examples showing how our results can be applied. The main motivation comes from the theory of infinite ergodic group actions where it was shown by Glasner and Weiss [GW] , [GS1] that every infinite ergodic action of a countable amenable group G admits a unique invariant Radon measure µG . In this case the space X is taken as the dual group G equipped with its left Haar measure m.",

    "We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations for two stars, HD 122563 (=HR 5171A) and BD+17°3248, which are suspected to be members of the proposed intermediate age population of helium-rich giants in the globular cluster Omega Cen.  We find that both stars have very similar atmospheric parameters as those found by previous studies for other candidate helium-rich giant candidates in Omega Cen: T eff = 8200 K; log g = 3.8; [Fe/H] = -1.0 dex. The observed spectra show no evidence for He II lines at 4686 Å or 5412 Å, but do exhibit strong Balmer line emission with equivalent widths ranging between -40 and -50 mÅ. These results suggest that these stars may not actually belong to this proposed class of objects. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are indeed helium-rich giants on the basis of our current data set alone.",
    "We present the first results on clustering measurements for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range 0.5 <z<0.8, obtained with the Anglo-Australian Observatory's multi-object spectrograph AAOmega. We use data from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO survey to measure the projected correlation function wp(rp). The observed clustering amplitude is consistent with that expected from linear theory predictions based on current cosmological models. This result provides an important test of these models over this redshift range where there are few other constraints available. In addition we find evidence for evolution in the galaxy bias parameter between our two samples separated by ~0.2 Gyrs. These results will be presented in detail elsewhere. \n \n Keywords: Luminous Red Galaxies; Clustering; Bias Evolution; Cosmology. 1 Introduction \n \n A number of recent studies have shown that luminous red galaxies (hereafter LRGs), selected via their optical colours or near-infrared photometry, provide powerful probes of large-scale structure out to high redshifts (e.g., Eisenstein et al. 2001; Wake et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2007; Blake et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2008) . Their large luminosities mean they can be detected efficiently even at relatively low redshifts, while their red colours make them easy to identify spectroscopically. They also tend to reside in massive dark matter haloes which evolve slowly through cosmic time, making them useful tracers of the underlying mass distribution. As such, they offer unique opportunities to study both the growth of structures as well as the nature of dark energy driving its accelerated expansion (see e.g., Percival & White 2009 , for a review). \n \n Here we report the first measurement of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs in the redshift range 0<z<0.8 made possible by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (Colless et al.",
    "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether virtual ultrasound (US) puncture tracts can improve percutaneous renal access in patients with complex anatomy and difficult-to-visualize calices on fluoroscopy.  In total, 50 consecutive patients underwent US-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy using an in-room C-arm system for real-time image guidance. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. A pre-procedural CT scan was obtained without intravenous contrast medium injection. Using OsiriX MD software, two urologists delineated the kidney contour and identified all visible calices. Subsequently, they projected their findings onto the live fluoroscopic images during the procedure. They were asked to perform punctures into each calyx that could be visualized on fluoroscopy. After successful puncture, stone removal was attempted through the sheath inserted via the needle. Successful puncture was defined as reaching at least one calix. Overall success rate was 88%. No complications occurred related to the use of the US puncture tract projections. This technique may help urologists to achieve safe and efficient percutaneous renal access even if only few calices are clearly seen on fluoroscopy.",

    "We consider the linearization problem for the Painleve' equations PIII, PV and PVI in terms of their Lax pairs. We show that these problems are equivalent to certain reductions of the three-wave resonant system. The results obtained here can be regarded as an extension of those by Zakharov et al., who studied the reduction of the two-wave resonant system corresponding to the Painleve' II equation. In particular we prove that there is no non-trivial solution of the linearized PIII or PV equation which decays exponentially at infinity if one imposes some additional conditions on its asymptotic behavior near the origin. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Painleve' equations play important roles both in mathematics and physics (see e.g.  [1] , [4] ). They have been extensively investigated during last decades mainly due to their rich structures such as soliton solutions and Bäcklund transformations. Recently it has been shown that they also appear naturally in various physical models including nonlinear optics [2] . For example, the so-called NLS equation with cubic-quintic nonlinearity arises from the propagation of intense laser beams through Kerr media [3] .\nIn this article we study the linearization problem for several types of the Painleve's equations. More precisely let us consider the following systems of partial differential equations: \nwhere u = u(t, x) ∈ C n+1 , v = v(t, x) and w = w(t, x) are complex-valued functions of t > 0 and x ∈ R 1 .

    "The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly known as GLAST) is scheduled to launch in June 2008 and will be able to detect gamma rays with energies ranging from 20 MeV up to 300 GeV, covering an energy range that was previously unexplored by space-based instruments.  The LAT instrument on board Fermi consists of four identical towers each containing 16 silicon strip trackers surrounded by tungsten converters followed by CsI(Tl) scintillators. Each tracker module has a thickness of 1 cm and contains 12 layers of silicon strips oriented at different angles relative to one another. This design allows for accurate measurement of both the direction and energy of incident photons. In addition, there are two calorimeter sections located behind the tracker modules which contain 8 planes of CsI(Tl). These detectors provide excellent angular resolution and good energy resolution over most of the energy band. The main goal of this work is to develop a detailed understanding of the Galactic diffuse emission observed by the LAT detector so that it can be accurately modeled when analyzing data taken during its mission lifetime.",
    "We study the holographic entanglement entropy for three-dimensional de Sitter space with gravitational Chern-Simons term by using the replica trick and the covariant phase-space method. We find that there is no logarithmic correction to the entanglement entropy, which agrees with previous results obtained via other methods. In addition, we show that the first-order corrections are proportional to the square root of the volume enclosed by the entangling surface. Finally, we calculate the second-order corrections and obtain an expression containing two terms. One of them has been previously found in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 98 (2018) 084011] while another one is new. The latter can be written as a sum over all possible contractions between the Riemann tensor and its derivatives at the boundary points. This result shows that the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling constant plays a role similar to the Newton's constant in four dimensions.",
    "We study the stability properties of magnetized relativistic flows with helical symmetry, which are described by exact solutions to Einstein's field equations coupled to Maxwell's equations for an electromagnetic field that is purely electric or purely magnetic along each fluid line. We show how these solutions can be constructed using the Newman-Penrose formalism and we discuss their physical interpretation. In particular, we find that there exist two classes of such solutions depending on whether they contain a \"dynamo region\" where the magnetic energy density grows exponentially fast (and thus cannot be matched onto any solution at spatial infinity) or not. The latter class contains all known stationary axisymmetric black hole electrovacuum solutions. Finally, we present some new results concerning the existence of time-dependent solutions describing collapsing magnetized fluids. These solutions may have interesting applications to astrophysics.

    "We present new measurements of the baryonic mass fractions (f bar ) in early-type galaxies, based on spatially resolved kinematics for a sample of 12 nearby elliptical/S0 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy at optical wavelengths.  We use these data to measure f bar , as well as the total stellar masses M * . The results are compared against predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within the standard ΛCDM cosmology. Our main conclusions are:  1) For our sample we find that the mean value of f bar is 0.16 ± 0.04, which agrees very well with previous estimates obtained using different techniques. 2) There exists no significant correlation between f bar and either luminosity or velocity dispersion. 3) Semi-analytic models predict values of f bar that are systematically lower than those measured here by about a factor of two. 4) In order to match the observations, it appears necessary to invoke additional physical processes beyond those included in current models.",
    "The nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) of matrix product form are the focus of this work, which is intended to be useful for researchers in computational physics and chemistry who wish to solve problems with such NESSs using numerical methods.  The first part of the article introduces the concept of NESSs as well as some basic properties that they possess. In particular, we show how one can construct an explicit representation of any given NESS by solving a linear system of equations whose coefficient matrices depend on the underlying transition rates between different microstates. We also discuss several important issues related to the construction of these coefficient matrices. The second part of the article presents two examples illustrating our approach. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion about various aspects of the proposed method along with possible extensions. Nonequilibrium steady states (NESs), i.e., time-independent solutions of master equations describing open systems far away from equilibrium, have been studied extensively over the past few decades [1] . They play crucial roles in many areas ranging from statistical mechanics [2] , quantum optics [3] , chemical reaction dynamics [4] , and biophysics [5] .\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in developing efficient algorithms for computing NESs [6] - [8] . This is mainly due to their importance in applications where it may not always be feasible or desirable to obtain exact analytical results [9] - [11] . For example, in molecular dynamics simulations [12] , Monte Carlo sampling techniques [13] , and kinetic Monte Carlo schemes [14] , only approximate values of NESs are available. Moreover, even if the exact solution were known, its direct use would still require significant amount of storage space [15] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop fast and accurate numerical methods for calculating NESs [16] - [18] .\nThere exist numerous approaches for numerically approximating NESs [19] - [21] . Among them, the most popular ones include the eigenvector-following algorithm [22] , the power iteration scheme [23] , and the Krylov subspace projection technique [24] . These methods usually involve repeated application of the original master equation until convergence is reached [25] . However, since the number of...",

    "The quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects on the dynamics and decoherence of semiconductor-based qubit systems are investigated in this work. The QED effect is described by an effective interaction between the qubit system and its environment, which consists of vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field as well as thermal photons at finite temperature. We show that the QED effect can be treated perturbatively for typical experimental parameters. In particular, we find that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free space modes increases with increasing number N of electrons involved in the qubit state. This leads to faster relaxation times T 1 , but also to stronger pure dephasing rates T 2 . For realistic values of N = 10 − 100, however, these effects remain small compared to other sources of relaxation such as phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum information processing has attracted considerable attention over recent years due to its potential applications in various fields ranging from communication technology [1] to metrology [2] . Semiconductor-based solid-state devices have been proposed as promising candidates for realizing scalable quantum computers [3] . Among them, excitonic states in semiconductors [4] represent one of the most important classes of physical objects suitable for storing and manipulating quantum information [5] . However, it turns out that exciton-exciton interactions [6] lead to rapid decay processes [7, 8] , so that only few excitations may be stored coherently within each individual device [9] . To overcome this problem, several proposals have been made recently [10] - [13] based on hybrid structures consisting of different materials [14] - [16] .\n \nIn this Letter, we investigate how the quantum electrodynamic (or radiative) coupling [17] affects the dynamics of semiconductor-based qubit sys-tems. As shown schematically in Fig. 1(a) , our model includes two types of environments surrounding the qubit system: First, there exist vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields inside the cavity [18] , leading to spontaneous emission of excitons into free-space modes [19, 20] . Second, there exists a bath of thermal photons [21]",
    "We study the resonance phenomenon for an open-loop control problem in a nonlinear stochastic model describing interactions between phytoplankton (plants) and zooplankton (animals). The main goal is to find optimal values of parameters characterizing external periodic forcing, which maximize the growth rate of planktons. We show that this optimization problem can be reduced to finding solutions of some algebraic equations. In particular, we prove that there exists only one solution corresponding to maximum value of the objective function. Moreover, it turns out that the obtained results are robust with respect to small perturbations of initial conditions. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate our theoretical findings. \n \n Keywords: Stochastic differential equation, Periodic forcing, Resonance, Optimization problems, Nonlinear dynamics \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Interactions among different species play important role in many natural ecosystems. For example, phytoplankton (algae or plants), living at the base of food chain, provide energy source for other organisms such as zooplankton (fishes or animals). Therefore, understanding how these two populations interact may help us better understand ecosystem functioning. Recently, several mathematical models have been proposed to describe population dynamics of phytoplankton- zooplankton systems [1–3] . These models include deterministic terms representing intrinsic growth rates of both populations and their interaction effects, as well as random fluctuations due to environmental factors. It has been shown that under certain assumptions on the coefficients of the model, its long-term behavior exhibits chaotic attractor [4] , which makes analysis of the system very difficult. On the other hand, if the effect of random fluctuations is neglected then the resulting deterministic model becomes much easier to analyze [5–7] .\n \nIn [8] , authors studied the following model:\n \n \n \n dX(t) = rX(t)(1 - X(t))dt + fX(t)sin(wt)dW(t),\n dY(t) = rY(t)(1 - Y(t))dt + fy(t)sin(w0t)dW(t).\n \n(",
    "We show that the coherence property for monadic second-order logic (MSO) over graphs is not equivalent to the existence of an MSO-unique normal form, answering a question raised by Courcelle and Engelfriet in 1990.  We also prove that this result holds even if we restrict our attention to finite trees or forests with bounded degree. This answers another open problem posed by Courcelle and Makowsky in 1991. Finally, we give examples showing that these results are optimal. The main tool used here is a new technique called tree-expansion which allows us to reduce questions about infinite structures to questions about finite ones. Monadic second-order logic (or MSO-logic) has been studied extensively since its introduction in the 1960s as a generalization of first-order logic. It was shown early on that it can express many interesting properties such as connectivity, planarity, and Hamiltonicity. In particular, MSO-formulas define exactly those sets definable in existential monadic second-order logic, i.e., the class of all sets definable using quantification only over subsets of vertices.",
    "We present the first results on black hole accretion using our new numerical scheme, which is based on an implicit-explicit time integration method and uses adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). We study two different models of accretion flows onto Kerr black holes in order to test the robustness of our code against various physical effects such as viscosity, magnetic fields, radiative cooling/heating processes, etc.. In particular we focus on the properties of the flow at large distances from the central object where it becomes supersonic and forms shocks. Our main goal here was to check whether these features are correctly captured by our AMR code. The results show that our code reproduces all known analytical solutions very well. \n \n Keywords: Black holes - General relativity - Numerical methods - Shocks - Supersonic turbulence - Time-dependent simulations \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It has been more than 30 years since the discovery of quasars [1] . Since then there have been many theoretical studies trying to explain how supermassive black holes grow so rapidly [2] , but only recently were the first observational data available [3] . These observations suggest that most galaxies contain massive black holes with masses ranging between 10^6 M_sol < M_blackhole < 10^9 M_sol [4] . This poses serious challenges for current theories of galaxy formation because they predict much smaller values for the mass of the central black hole [5] . \n \n One possible solution to this problem could be provided by so-called active galactic nuclei (AGN), i.e., systems containing a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk [6] . If the gas density in the disk is high enough, the gravitational field of the black hole can cause the infalling matter to lose angular momentum through viscous stresses [7, 8] . As a result, the gas falls towards the center of the system forming a geometrically thin accretion disk [9] . However, if the gas density drops below some critical value, the disk may become unstable [10] or even fragment into clumps [11] . Such instabilities lead to the development of large-scale",
    "The SIM PlanetQuest mission is the most promising near-term technique for detecting, finding masses, and determining three-dimensional orbits of nearby habitable planets.  This article describes how SIM PlanetQuest will find these planets by measuring their astrometric wobble as they transit in front of their parent stars.   It also discusses how SIM PlanetQuest can be used to detect other types of exoplanets such as those with large orbital eccentricities or that are on highly inclined orbits relative to our line-of-sight.    Finally, it presents some preliminary results showing what we might expect to learn about extrasolar planetary systems using this new instrumentation. Keywords: Extrasolar planet, Astrometry, SIM PlanetQuest, Transit detection, Mass measurement, Orbital determination. 1 Introduction   In recent years there has been an explosion in interest in discovering extra-solar terrestrial planets (exo-Earths) because of the possibility that one may harbor life like Earth does. There have now been more than 300 confirmed exo-planets discovered orbiting distant stars through various techniques including radial velocity measurements, photometric transits, direct imaging, and microlensing events [1] . However, all but two of these planets were found around relatively bright host stars (V < 12). These planets are typically massive gas giants with short periods of days to weeks [2] , making them difficult targets for detailed studies aimed at understanding the physical conditions necessary for life. For example, only three of these planets have measured masses: HD 209458b [3] , GJ 436b [4] , and OGLE-TR-561b [5] .  Of these, only HD 209458b has a radius determined directly [6] .\n2\n\nSIM PlanetQuest Mission Overview\nIn order to study the atmospheres and surfaces of smaller, cooler planets, which are likely candidates for hosting liquid water [7, 8] , astronomers need to find planets around fainter stars. To do so requires space-based observatories capable of obtaining high-precision astrometric data over many years. Such observations would allow us to measure the positions of thousands of faint stars simultaneously with precisions better than 0",
    "We report on observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton that reveal an X-ray flare from the magnetar CXOU J16 47 10 . 2-45 52 16 (hereafter, J1647) located within the open cluster Westerlund 1. The flare was detected by both observatories during their respective slews to point at another target; it lasted for about one hour before fading below detectability. We find no evidence for any significant change in the spin-down rate or period derivative of this source following its outburst. \n \n This is the first time such a large event has been observed from a magnetar; we estimate that the total energy released in the flare was ~3 x 10^44 erg. Our analysis shows that the flare occurred when the star's magnetic field lines were nearly perpendicular to our line-of-sight. In addition, we detect pulsations from J1647 during the flare which are consistent with those seen prior to the flare. These results suggest that the flaring activity may be due to reconnection events occurring along the closed loops of the stellar magnetic field.",
    "We have analyzed new photometric data for two AM CVn-type systems, HP Librae (=PG 1336-018) and V803 Cen, obtained with the Kepler space telescope in order to determine their orbital periods more accurately than before.  We find that both systems are eclipsing binaries with very short orbital periods of only P orb = 81.6 min for HP Librae and P orb = 80.3 min for V803 Cen. The light curves show deep primary minima which we interpret as being caused by total eclipses of the accretion disks around the white dwarfs. In addition, there is evidence for an additional eclipse feature at phase 0.5-0.7 in the case of HP Librae. This could be due either to partial eclipses or occultations of one component by another. For comparison purposes, we also present results on the previously known system CR Boo.",
    "In this work, we propose the subjective information measure (SIM) to quantify the amount of information in an image or video sequence. The SIM is defined as the minimum number of bits required for lossless coding of the source data under some fidelity criterion. We show that the proposed SIM can be used to derive rate-distortion functions with high accuracy by using only one parameter. In addition, it also provides accurate prediction on ratedistortion performance at low bit rates. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments conducted on several test sequences. Index Terms -Information theory, Image compression, Video compression. 1 Introduction Data compression has been widely studied over past decades due to its importance in many applications such as digital storage systems, communication networks, medical imaging, etc.. A fundamental problem in data compression is how to accurately predict the compressed file size given the original uncompressed data. This problem is usually referred to as rate-distortion analysis [1] . It is well known that the rate-distortion function characterizes the relationship between the average codeword length and distortion level achieved by any optimal encoding scheme [2] .\nThe most commonly adopted approach to solve the rateconstraint optimization problems is Lagrangian relaxation [3] , which transforms constrained optimization into unconstrained ones via introducing additional variables called Lagrange multipliers [4] . However, solving these problems requires iterative algorithms [5] , which are computationally expensive [6] . To overcome this difficulty, researchers have developed various fast algorithms [7, 8] . Nevertheless, they still suffer from slow convergence speed when applied to practical problems [9] .",
    "We consider a spherically symmetric solution to Einstein's equations in five dimensions with an extra dimension compactified on S 1 /Z 2 . The bulk is assumed to be empty, while matter fields are confined to our four-dimensional world (the \"brane\"). We find that this model can explain the observed flatness of galactic rotation curves without introducing any new particles or exotic forms of energy density. In particular we show how the mass distribution within galaxies may arise naturally as a consequence of the geometry of space-time. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456728. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.Cq  A fundamental question about the nature of dark matter has been whether it consists of one or more species of particle. If so, what are their masses? What interactions do they have with ordinary matter? How much dark matter does each galaxy contain? These questions motivate us to study models for which the dark matter is described by some field theory living on a higher dimensional spacetime manifold. \n \n Here we will focus on a class of solutions where the extra dimension is compactified on a circle $S^1$. Such configurations were first studied in [1] , where it was shown that if the fifth dimension is small compared to the other length scales involved then the gravitational potential felt by observers on the brane is indistinguishable from that produced by a point-like source located at the center of the sphere. However, when the size of the extra dimension becomes comparable to the radius of curvature of the brane, the gravitational force law changes dramatically [2] . \n \n In [3] , Randall and Sundrum showed that such a configuration could provide a natural explanation for the hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. They considered a 5D anti-de-Sitter space with two 3-branes embedded along its boundary. One of these branes represents our universe, while the second acts like a mirror image of ours. Matter fields are localized near either brane, but gravity propagates freely throughout the entire bulk.",
    "We present an analysis of the kinematic properties of high velocity stars (HVSs) found by Brown et al. (2007a,b) . We find that these HVSs are consistent with being ejected from the Galactic center along orbits which have been perturbed by encounters with massive black holes at intermediate distances and possibly also by other mechanisms such as gravitational scattering off molecular clouds or globular clusters. The observed velocities of the HVSs can be reproduced if they were ejected between 0.5 and 1 Gyr ago on nearly radial orbits with eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.9. This is consistent with theoretical predictions for the time scale over which dynamical friction causes the orbital decay of massive objects into the central regions of galaxies. \n \n Keywords: High-velocity star, Black hole, Galaxy evolution, Ejection mechanism, Dynamical friction, Halo shape \n \n Introduction \n \n Hypervelocity stars (HVSs; Brown et al., 2007a; Kenyon et al., 2008 ) are defined as those having space velocities exceeding 500 km/s relative to their local standard of rest. They may originate either from tidal disruption events involving compact remnants near the Galactic Center (GC; Hills 1988), or from binary systems where one component has been accelerated through strong interactions with another object (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2003; Bromley et al. 2006 ). In addition, it was suggested recently that some HVSs could be produced via the interaction of a single star with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) located outside the GC (Yu & Madau 2007; Sesana et al. 2007 ) . It should be noted however that there exists no compelling evidence yet supporting this scenario .",
    "We study the phase diagram and critical behavior for the two component symmetric exclusion process (TCSEP) on an infinite one-dimensional lattice, where particles can hop to nearest neighbor sites only if they are empty. We show that there is no condensation at finite density when the system has periodic boundary conditions. However, we find that the TCSEP undergoes a first-order phase transition into a condensed state as soon as it is coupled to particle reservoirs at its ends. The order parameter jumps discontinuously across this transition line which terminates at a tricritical point. In addition, we calculate exactly the current-current correlation function along the transition line using Bethe ansatz techniques. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to higher dimensions. PACS numbers: 05.40.+j, 64.60.Cn, 71.10.Jk \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe aim of this work is to investigate the properties of a simple model of interacting particles in contact with particle reservoirs. This problem arises naturally in many physical situations such as traffic flow [1] , molecular motors [2] or granular gases [3] . Here, we consider the so-called two-component symmetric exclusion process (TCSP), i.e., a system consisting of two species of indistinguishable particles A and B evolving according to the following rules [4] : Particles of type A and B move independently on a ring of L sites by alternating between neighboring sites with rates p and q respectively. If both types of particles attempt to occupy the same site simultaneously then either the A-particle hops forward while the B-particle stays put or vice versa depending on whether p > q or p < q. Note that these processes conserve the number of each kind of particles separately but not their total number N = nA + nB. Therefore, the dynamics of the TCSP is described by the master equation",
    "We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamic crack propagation in an icosahedral AlPdMn quasicrystal and its periodic approximant, i-AlCuFe. The results show that both materials exhibit similar features for the crack growth process at low temperatures (T = 300 K). However, there are significant differences between them when T is increased up to 600 K. In particular, we find that the quasicrystal shows a higher resistance against crack propagation than the approximant under tensile loading conditions. This behavior can be explained by considering the different atomic structures of these two systems. \n \n We also studied how the temperature affects the mechanical properties of the quasicrystal. Our results indicate that increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the elastic constants C11 and C44 as well as in the bulk modulus B. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the Young's moduli E decreases with increasing temperature.",
    "We study the phenomenological consequences of supersymmetric models with gauge-mediated breaking, in which the Standard Model is extended by adding new vector-like matter fields and extra dimensions. We show that these models can be constructed such that they are free of any unnatural fine-tuning problems associated with the Higgs mass or flavor-changing neutral currents. In particular we find that:  1) The lightest scalar superpartner (the \"Higgs\" boson) has a mass at most around 300 GeV.  2) Flavor changing neutral current effects are suppressed to an acceptable level for generic values of parameters.  3) Gauge coupling unification occurs naturally within experimental uncertainties. 4) There exists a large parameter space where all sparticles have masses above 1 TeV while still satisfying constraints on electroweak symmetry breaking. 5) These models provide a natural explanation for why there may not yet exist evidence for supersymmetry at accelerator experiments.",
    "We present numerical simulations to study the formation, evolution, and collapse of quiescent cloud cores induced by dynamic compressions in turbulent molecular clouds. We find that these cloud cores are formed through shock compression at intersections between shocks driven into the clouds by supersonic turbulence. The cloud core masses range from 0.1 M⊙ to 1 M⊙ with typical sizes of about 1000 AU. These cloud cores have low internal velocities (< 2 km s-1) but can be accelerated up to 10 km s-1 during their lifetimes due to gravitational interactions with other dense clumps within the same clouds. Most of them evolve quasi-statically for several free-fall times before collapsing dynamically on time scales ranging from one to ten free-fall times. Our results suggest that such cloud cores may represent an important source of prestellar objects in star-forming regions. Keywords: Turbulence, Star Formation",
    "The quantum auction is an extension to the classical sealed-bid auction, where bidders can submit bids in superposition and the auctioneer announces the winning bid by measuring the state of the system.  The main advantage over classical auctions is that it allows for more efficient use of resources when there are many items being sold or many potential buyers.   In this work we study the problem of finding optimal strategies for both the seller and buyer in such an auction setting with multiple items and multiple buyers.   We show how to find the optimal strategy for the seller using linear programming techniques and provide bounds on the number of measurements required to determine the winner's identity.   For the case of two buyers competing for three items, our results imply that the seller should always announce one item as the winner at each round until only one buyer remains.   ... Quantum mechanics has been used to develop new types of auctions which allow sellers to make better decisions about what goods they want to sell and buyers to make better decisions about which goods they wish to purchase. These auctions have been shown to be useful even if all parties involved do not trust each other completely.",
    "We report on the optical investigation of single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) in an external magnetic field applied along their growth direction. The QD emission line splits into two components with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to about 1 T, which corresponds to the Zeeman splitting energy of 0.5 meV at 4 K. We observe that this splitting increases linearly as temperature decreases down to 20 mK and then saturates below 10 mK. This behavior can be explained by taking into account both electron-hole exchange interaction and phonon-assisted relaxation processes between different excitonic states within QDs. Our results show that the spin-flip time for electrons confined inside QDs is longer than 100 ns even under high magnetic fields up to 5 T. Quantum dot (QD), also known as semiconductor nanocrystal or artificial atom, has attracted much attention due to its unique physical properties such as size-tunable band gap [1] , strong confinement effect [2] , and large oscillator strength [3] . These features make it possible to use QDs as building blocks for various optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes [4] , lasers [5] , solar cells [6] , photodetectors [7] , and so forth [8] .\nIn recent years, there have been many efforts devoted to investigating the spin dynamics of carriers confined in QDs [9] - [11] . It was found that the carrier spins are very stable against decoherence caused by environmental noise [12] - [14] . However, the spin flip times were reported to vary widely depending on experimental conditions [15] - [17] . For example, the spin lifetimes of holes [18] and electrons [19] confined in QDs were measured to be several nanoseconds using pulsed excitation techniques. On the other hand, the spin lifetime of electrons [20] and holes [21] confined in QDs could reach microsecond level if continuous wave laser was used instead.",
    "We study cascades on large blog graphs, where each node is an individual blogger and edges represent links between blogs. We propose a novel cascade model that captures the fact that people are more likely to read posts by their friends than random posts. Our main contributions are: (1) we develop efficient algorithms for computing the cascade size distribution under our model; (2) we show how to use these results to estimate the number of active users at any given time during a cascade; (3) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using data collected from LiveJournal.com. The Web has become one of the most important communication channels today. In particular, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter have attracted millions of users who share information with others through online messages known as tweets or status updates. These messages can be seen by all followers of the user posting them, which may cause further propagation of the message within the network. This phenomenon is called viral marketing [1] , and it has been studied extensively over recent years [2] . However, despite its importance, there still remain many open questions about the dynamics of this process [3] .\nIn this work, we focus on studying cascades on large blogging communities, where each node represents an individual blogger and edges connect pairs of blogs written by the same person [4] . A cascade starts when some blogger writes a post containing a URL pointing to another blog's page. Then, if her readers click on the link, they will visit the other blog and possibly continue reading additional posts. As shown in Figure 1 , the resulting graph contains several connected components representing different topics discussed by the community members.",
    "We present an analysis of X-ray data obtained with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory for a sample of galaxies selected to be bright at infrared wavelengths (Ks < 20) and located within the Chandra Deep Field-South survey region. We find that most of these objects are active galactic nuclei, but we also identify several cases where the observed X-ray emission is likely due to star formation activity. The majority of our sources have luminosities below 1043 erg s-1, which suggests they may represent a population of low-luminosity AGNs missed by previous surveys. In addition, we detect two heavily absorbed quasars whose optical counterparts were previously classified as reddened stars or galaxies. These results demonstrate how deep X-ray observations can provide new insights into galaxy evolution studies based on multiwavelength datasets. This work was supported under NASA Contract NAS8-38252.

    "We report on X-ray observations made with ASCA and Chandra of PSR B1257+12, which is in orbit around its companion star. The observed fluxes are consistent with those expected for an isolated neutron star heated by accretion from the stellar wind.  We find that the spectrum can be fit equally well using either blackbody or power-law models; however, we cannot rule out other spectral shapes such as thermal bremsstrahlung. In addition to the point source at the position of the pulsar, there appears to be diffuse emission surrounding it. This may arise from hot plasma trapped between the pulsar's magnetosphere and the stellar surface. If this interpretation is correct then our results suggest that the magnetic field lines connecting the two stars have been disrupted by tidal forces during their close passage through periastron. Finally, we discuss possible origins for the unusually high spin-down rate inferred for PSR B1257 + 12 based on radio timing measurements.",

The proposed method allows us to obtain posterior distributions over the unknown source parameters, which can be used as prior information in subsequent inverse problems or uncertainty quantification studies. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to two different test cases with synthetic data generated using the finite element method (FEM). Our results show that we are able to recover the true source distribution accurately even if only few measurements are available. Furthermore, we compare our method against state-of-the-art algorithms and find that our approach outperforms them significantly when the number of measurement locations is small. Finally, we apply our method to real-world data obtained during a field experiment at the University of Houston's Space Research Center. This dataset consists of temperature measurements taken inside a building after a fire was started near one of its walls.",
    "We consider the scalar field theory on a noncommutative (NC) background with spherical symmetry and derive the NC generalization of the Klein-Gordon equation for such fields. We show that this equation can be written as an infinite set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are equivalent to each other under certain conditions. The solutions of these equations describe different types of waves propagating along geodesics in the NC geometry. In particular we find exact solutions describing massless particles moving at the speed of light. These results may have important implications for quantum gravity phenomenology. Introduction -The idea that spacetime coordinates do not commute is one of the most intriguing concepts emerging from recent developments in string/M-theory [1] . It has been shown [2] , however, that if one considers only classical physics then it is impossible to construct a consistent model based on this concept because of the presence of ultraviolet divergences. This problem was solved by Snyder [3] who introduced a new type of coordinate transformations leading to a deformed Poincaré algebra [4] .\nIn order to study physical effects associated with the existence of a minimal length scale in nature, several authors considered various models where the commutator between two spatial coordinates [x i , x j ] = ıθ ij depends on some parameters θ ij [5] . Such deformations lead to modifications of the standard dispersion relations [6] and also affect the propagation properties of matter fields [7, 8] . For example, it has recently been suggested [9] that the introduction of a minimal length scale into the description of gravitational interactions could resolve the black hole information paradox [10] . Another interesting possibility is related to the fact that the deformation parameter θ ij can be chosen so that its magnitude decreases rapidly when the distance r increases [11] . As a result, the effect of noncommutativity becomes negligible outside a small region around the origin [12] . Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the noncommutativity of space affects only local phenomena while leaving global ones unchanged [13] .",
    "We report on observations made in March and April 2002 at 345 GHz using the Atacama Submillimiter Telescope Experiment (ASTE). We detected no significant emission associated with the host galaxy of the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425, which was discovered by BeppoSAX on Apr. 25, 1998 . The 3 sigma upper limit to the flux density is < 0.5 Jy beam-1 , corresponding to an integrated line intensity ICO< 1 x 10^9 K km s^-1 pc^2 or Mgas < 2 x 10^8 Msun .\nThe non-detection suggests that either the molecular gas mass is much lower than previously estimated or that it has been destroyed by the intense UV radiation field produced during the burst.  These results are consistent with those obtained recently by other groups who have searched for CO emission from this source. If our result can be confirmed then it will provide important constraints on models of the formation of massive stars.",
    "The MiniBooNE experiment has recently reported the observation of an excess in electron-neutrino-like events at low energies, which could be explained by sterile neutrinos with mass around 1 eV and mixing angle sin2(2θ) ~ 0.1. \n \n In this work we study how these results can be accommodated within the framework of three-flavor leptonic mixing using the latest global fits to experimental data on neutrino oscillation parameters as well as cosmological constraints on the sum of active neutrino masses. We find that the allowed parameter space is strongly constrained if one assumes that the observed excess corresponds to true neutrino oscillations into sterile states rather than being due to background systematics or statistical fluctuations. The best-fit values for the sterile neutrino mass splitting are found to be Δm32 = (0.5 - 2.3) meV and Δm2 = (0.4 - 3.6) meV, while the corresponding ranges for the mixing angles are θ23 = 42° - 50° , θ13 < 5° and θ12 > 40° .",
    "The electronic structure, the equilibrium geometry and the finite-temperature properties are investigated for sodium clusters with 39 to 55 atoms by using density functional theory within generalized gradient approximation. The results show that the ground state is always in C_sv symmetry except for Na_55 which has D_5h symmetry as its lowest energy configuration. For all these clusters, we find that there exists an odd-even effect on their structural parameters such as bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle. We also investigate the vibrational frequencies and infrared intensities of these clusters at room temperature. It turns out that the calculated values agree well with those obtained experimentally. Finally, we study the thermodynamic stability of these clusters. Our calculations indicate that most of them have high melting temperatures but some of them may be unstable against dissociation into smaller fragments. \n \n Keywords: Sodium cluster, Electronic structure, Vibrational frequency, Infrared intensity",
    "We study the effects of selection biases in cluster samples, as well as covariance between observables, on scaling relations derived from X-ray data using mock galaxy clusters generated with the semi-analytic model GALFORM. We find that both these effects can lead to significant systematic errors when deriving cosmological constraints from observed scaling relations. In particular we show that: (i) The scatter in the M-T relation is significantly reduced by including additional information about the temperature distribution function; this effect is stronger for low mass systems. (ii) The slope of the L-M relation depends strongly on whether or not one includes cooling flows in the analysis. This dependence arises because cool cores are more common at high masses than at lower masses, leading to an apparent steepening of the slope if they are excluded. (iii) The normalization of the Y-Xray luminosity-temperature relation shows strong redshift evolution which cannot be explained solely by self-similar evolution.",
    "We present new measurements of the mean and scatter in the velocity dispersion-optical richness relation (VRR) for galaxy clusters selected by their red-sequence galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). We use two different methods to measure cluster velocities, one based on spectroscopic observations of member galaxies and another that uses photometric redshift estimates of all galaxies within a fixed aperture centered on each cluster's brightest cluster galaxy (BGG).\nThe results are consistent with previous studies at low-redshift but show significant differences when compared to recent work done at higher redshifts. The discrepancies between our results and those presented in earlier works may be due to systematic effects associated with the measurement techniques used or could indicate evolution in the VRR over time. In either case, these results highlight the need for further investigation into this relationship as well as other scaling relations involving galaxy clusters. \n \n Keywords: galaxy cluster, optical richness",
    "The conformational space available to the side chains in proteins can be explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but this approach requires extensive computational resources for large systems. We have developed an alternative method that uses normal mode analysis (NMA), which has been shown previously to provide accurate predictions of protein motions at low computational cost.  In our new method we use NMA to calculate the free energy landscape associated with each side chain rotation angle. The resulting landscapes are then used as input into a statistical mechanical model that predicts the equilibrium distribution of rotamers observed experimentally. This method was tested on two small proteins containing multiple proline residues, where it correctly predicted the relative population of different rotameric states. It also accurately reproduced experimental results obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Finally, we applied this method to study the effect of mutations on the rotamer distributions of several amino acids. Our results show how changes in the local environment affect the rotamer preferences of these residues.",
    "We present an approach to the assimilation of magnetic field observations into numerical models using variational methods. The method is applied to a simple model problem in which we consider the evolution of a single component of the magnetic vector potential in a two-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions. We use this example as a testbed to explore how different choices of observation operator affect the quality of the resulting analysis fields. In particular, we compare results obtained by applying our algorithm directly on the state variable (the magnetic vector potential) against those obtained when it is first projected onto a set of basis functions that are chosen to be optimal for representing the solution at each time step. Our experiments show that both approaches yield similar results but that the latter can lead to significant computational savings. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a series of twin experiments in which synthetic magnetometer measurements are used to update the initial condition of the simulation.",
    "We present new optical spectroscopic observations and archival X-ray data for the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783, which show that its nuclear activity is dominated by an obscured AGN with a luminosity of ~10^43 erg/s (2-10 keV). The observed spectral energy distribution suggests that this source has been undergoing rapid changes between two distinct states over the past decade or so; one where it appears to be radiating at close to Eddington limit and another where it is much fainter but still highly luminous. We argue that these variations are likely driven by fluctuations in the mass inflow rate onto the central black hole. This interpretation is supported by our analysis of the time delays between different emission lines as well as their line widths. In particular we find that the Hβ emission line lags behind other lines such as He ii λ4686Å and C iv λ1549Å by upto several hundred days during periods when the source was brightest.",
    "We report the observation of measurement-induced dephasing in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using Ramsey interferometry and atom counting.  The experiment is performed by splitting a single trapped BEC into two spatially separated clouds, which are allowed to evolve for different times before being recombined on a beam splitter. We observe that the visibility of interference fringes decreases as we increase the number of atoms counted at one output port of the beam splitter. This effect can be explained by considering how repeated measurements affect the phase evolution of the system. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to use cold-atom experiments to study fundamental questions about quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics predicts that any attempt to measure a physical quantity will disturb its value. In this work, we experimentally investigate such effects in a Bose-Einsteint Condensate (BEC). To do so, we perform Ramsey interferometry between two spatially separated regions of our sample. By varying the time spent evolving freely after splitting off part of the initial cloud, we control the relative phase accumulated during free evolution. After recombination, we count the number of atoms arriving at each output port of the beam-splitter and record their arrival-time distribution. As expected, we find that the visibility of the resulting interference pattern decreases when increasing the number of detected particles.",
    "We prove that the transitive powers of the so-called ``Young-Jucys-Murphy\" (YJM) elements in any finite group G form an abelian subgroup of G, which is central if and only if G has no non-trivial normal subgroups. The YJM elements were introduced by Jucys and Murphy as generators for the center of the symmetric group S_n. We use this result to give a new proof of the fact that the center of the wreath product H ≀ S_n equals the direct sum of the centers of H and S_n. This also yields a simple proof of the fact that every element in the center of a finite group can be written as a linear combination of commutators with coefficients ±1. \nIntroduction\n\nLet G be a finite group. In their seminal work on the representation theory of the symmetric groups [Juc77] , Jucys and Murphy defined certain elements in the center Z(S_n) of the symmetric group S_n$ over the field F_q . These elements have been studied extensively since then; see e.g.  [BW03,  BW04,   BZ08,   ? ] .\nIn particular, it was shown in [BW03]  that these elements generate all of the center of S_n when n > 2 or q = p^r where r > 1.   It follows immediately from this theorem that the center of S_n contains at least one noncentral element whenever n < 4 or q = p^1 .  However, it remained open whether there exist other examples of finite groups whose center does not contain any noncentral elements besides those already known such as cyclic groups, dihedral groups, alternating groups etc. . \nThe main goal of our present article is to answer this question affirmatively by proving the following result:",
    "We present new near-infrared observations and analysis of the super star cluster (SSC) in the interacting galaxy pair NGC 1705, which is located at a distance of ~10 Mpc. The SSC has an age of ~30 Myr and contains several thousand massive stars with masses >20M☉ . We find that it exhibits many properties similar to those observed for young stellar clusters associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular, we detect a bright Wolf-Rayet population as well as evidence for ongoing mass loss via winds driven by evolved red supergiants. These results suggest that this system may be a local analogue to GRB progenitors. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX11AI18G issued through the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program.

    "We study the critical behaviour of irreversible reaction systems with mass-action kinetics in one dimension, using Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory. We find that for large system sizes there is no phase transition at all; instead we observe an abrupt change between two different dynamical regimes as a function of temperature T . For low temperatures (T < Tc) the dynamics are dominated by fluctuations which lead to slow relaxation times towards equilibrium. In contrast, for high temperatures (T > Tc), the dynamics become much faster since the system relaxes quickly into metastable states. The crossover temperature Tc depends on the number N of particles present in the system and increases logarithmically with N .\nThe results presented here can be understood within the framework of the recently developed concept of \"active matter\". Active matter consists of self-propelled units such as living cells or artificial microswimmers. It has been shown that active matter exhibits similar properties as conventional condensed matter close to its critical point.",
    "The rapid development in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has led to an increasing demand on wireless communications, which is expected to be fulfilled by using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). In this paper we present a novel CDMA-based ITS system that can provide high data rate and low latency services with improved security features compared to existing technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Bluetooth or ZigBee. The proposed system consists of three main components; namely, roadside units (RSUs), mobile vehicles equipped with on-board units (OBUs) and central servers located at traffic control centers (TCCs).\nWe first introduce the basic concepts behind the proposed system followed by describing its key characteristics. Then, we discuss some important issues related to the design of the proposed system including channel modeling, resource allocation algorithms, power consumption analysis and performance evaluation. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.",
    "The aim of this article is to present the basic concepts in Riemannian geometry that are needed for understanding the main results presented here.  The first section introduces some notation and definitions used throughout the text.   In particular we define what it means for two points on an n-dimensional manifold M to be close together (in terms of geodesic distance) or far apart.    We also introduce the concept of a local coordinate system at each point p ∈ M which allows us to describe any other point q near p by giving its coordinates with respect to these local charts.   Finally we give a brief description of how one can construct such a coordinate system locally around a given point using parallel transport along curves starting at p.    The second section describes the notion of a vector field X defined over all of M.   This is done by defining a map F : T M → R where T M denotes the tangent bundle of M.   Then we show that if X satisfies certain conditions then there exists a unique smooth function f : M → R such that X = grad(f).   Here grad(f) denotes the gradient of f.   For example, if M is a surface embedded in R3 then X could represent the velocity of a particle moving across M.   If we assume that the particles move according to Newton's laws of motion then the function f would correspond to the potential energy of the system under consideration.   The third section defines the concept of a tensor field as a generalization of vector fields.   Tensor fields allow us to associate several vectors...",
    "We consider the problem of approximating an unknown function f in L^2(0,1) by a linear combination of orthonormal polynomials with respect to some weight function w on (0,1). We show that if we choose the weights so as to minimize the error between the approximation and the true solution then this leads to a system of equations which can be solved using spectral methods. The resulting algorithm is shown to have optimal convergence rates under certain conditions. In particular it has been proved recently that if the coefficients of the expansion are chosen optimally then the rate of convergence is O(N^{-2}), where N denotes the number of terms used in the expansion. \nThe main purpose of this thesis was to implement these algorithms numerically and compare their performance against other existing techniques such as Chebyshev expansions or Legendre expansions. This work will also allow us to investigate whether there exist any advantages associated with choosing different types of basis functions when solving differential equations.",
    "We study the complexity of computing permanent polynomials over graphs with bounded treewidth, focusing on two special cases that are relevant to combinatorial optimization problems: (1) Perfect matchings in bipartite graphs, (2) Matricies whose entries can be expressed as linear combinations of perfect matchings in bipartite subgraphs. We show that both these classes have polynomial-time algorithms for evaluating their respective permanent polynomials when restricted to matrices of bounded treewidth. Our results imply new efficient algorithms for several important combinatorial optimization problems such as maximum weight independent set, minimum vertex cover, and weighted matroid intersection. In addition, we give an algorithm for approximating the permanent of any matrix within a factor of O(n^{1/3}), where n is the number of rows or columns of the input matrix. This improves upon the best known approximation ratio of O(n^{2/3}). Finally, we present some open questions related to our work.",
    "We study the non-equilibrium evolution of an interacting onedimensional Bose gas initially prepared in a coherent state with finite particle number fluctuations and show that it exhibits universal features, which are independent of microscopic details such as interactions or initial conditions. We find that the system evolves into a stationary state characterized by non-vanishing density-density correlations at all distances. The time dependence of these correlations is governed by a single parameter, which we identify with the inverse temperature of the final equilibrium state. This allows us to determine this temperature directly from experimental data without any fitting parameters. Our results provide new insights into the nonequilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems and may be tested experimentally using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe recent development of techniques for trapping and manipulating cold atomic gases has opened up exciting possibilities for studying strongly correlated quantum matter far from thermal equilibrium [1] . In particular, experiments have demonstrated how isolated quantum systems can evolve towards their ground states [2] , while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external control parameters [3] .\nIn this work, we consider the case where the system is suddenly quenched across a phase transition [4] . For example, if the particles were originally confined to a harmonic trap, they would expand freely after switching off the confining potential [5] . Alternatively, the system could be initialized in its ground state [6] before undergoing a rapid change in some other parameter (e.g., magnetic field) [7, 8] . In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will depend crucially on whether the system was initially prepared close to equilibrium [9] or not [10] . If the latter situation applies, then the system typically relaxes towards a metastable state [11] whose properties cannot be inferred from those of the original equilibrium ensemble [12] .",
    "The development of large space telescopes requires the use of lightweight materials to reduce launch costs and increase telescope performance in orbit. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an excellent candidate material due to its high strength, low density, and radiation hardness at cryogenic temperatures. However, it has been shown that SiC exhibits significant changes in thermal expansion with temperature which can lead to dimensional instability during cool-downs or warm-ups. This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry. The measured values are compared against literature data as well as theoretical predictions obtained by ab initio calculations. It was found that the experimental measurements agree very well with theory within the uncertainty limits. These results will be used to improve the design of future space missions such as JWST and WFIRST-AFTA.",
    "We study the controllability properties of quantum subsystems that are described by a master equation with Lindblad form. We show how to construct invariant sets for such systems in terms of their generators. These results allow us to prove that certain classes of open quantum systems cannot be controlled using only unitary operations on the system's Hilbert space. Finally we present an algorithm which allows one to determine whether or not a given set is invariant under the dynamics generated by a particular generator. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456628. Quantum mechanics has been successfully applied to many physical phenomena ranging from atomic physics to condensed matter theory. However, it remains unclear what exactly constitutes a quantum mechanical description of reality. One approach towards answering this question involves studying the behavior of closed quantum systems whose states evolve according to Schrödinger equations. Another approach focuses on describing the evolution of open quantum systems where the state of the system interacts continuously with its environment. The latter class of problems can often be formulated as questions about the controllability of quantum dynamical systems. For example, consider the problem of steering the state of a two-level atom between different energy levels using laser pulses.",
    "We present the first dual field theory in emergent spacetime, which is derived from a unifying field theory in higher dimensional spacetime. We show that this new dual field theory can be used to describe both quantum and classical physics with one single unified description. This new dual field theory has several advantages over other existing theories such as string/M-theory or loop quantum gravity. First, it provides an explicit mathematical formulation for describing physical phenomena at all scales ranging from microscopic scale down to macroscopic scale. Second, unlike string/M-theory or LQG, our new dual field theory does not require any extra dimensions beyond those already observed experimentally. Third, we provide a concrete example showing how our new dual field theory works by deriving Einstein's general relativity from our new dual field theory. Finally, we also derive Maxwell's equations from our new dual field... \nIntroduction:-In recent years there have been many attempts to develop a fundamental theory of everything(TOE). String/M-theory [1] , Loop Quantum Gravity [2] are two examples of these efforts. However, despite their successes they still suffer from some problems. For instance, string/M-theory requires extra dimensions [3] while loop quantum gravity suffers from non-renormalizability [4] . These difficulties motivate us to look for alternative approaches towards developing TOEs. Recently, a novel approach called \"emergent spacetime\" was proposed [5, 6] . According to this approach, space-time emerges from a more fundamental level [7, 8] .\nEmergent spacetime:-The idea behind emergent spacetime is very simple. It states that space-time is not fundamental but rather emerges from a more fundamental entity. To see why this might happen consider the following argument. Imagine you are sitting on your couch watching TV. You will probably say that the world around you looks flat because if you were standing up then you would notice that the ground below you is curved. Now imagine yourself floating above Earth. If you were standing up now then you wouldn't feel like you're standing on a curved surface anymore. Instead you'd feel like you're standing on top of a",
    "The authors present an experimental method for determining the probability that two photons simultaneously hit pixels in a detector, as well as its spatial resolution. The method is based on measuring correlations between pairs of photons emitted by a source with known angular distribution. It can be used to characterize any type of photon-counting detector (CCD cameras, photomultipliers etc.) without requiring knowledge about their internal structure or electronics. This information may then be used to improve the performance of imaging systems such as telescopes. The results are presented for a silicon-strip detector. They show good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/aa5e20\nSpatial resolution and coincidence resolving time measurement of Si strip detectors using single-photon counting technique \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nIn many applications it is important to know how accurately one can determine the position where a photon hits a detector. For example this information is needed when designing optical instruments like telescopes [1] . In order to measure the spatial resolution of a detector we need to have some reference point against which we compare our measured data [2] .\nOne way to obtain this reference point is to use a light source emitting photons at a well-defined angle relative to the normal direction [3] , see Fig.  1(a) . If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will come from a small area around the center of the detector surface. By scanning the detector over different angles θ, we can find out what fraction of the total number of counts comes from each part of the detector [4] . We call these fractions the response function R(θ) of the detector [5] . Knowing the shape of the response function allows us to calculate the spatial resolution of the detector [6] . However, if there is more than one pixel per unit solid angle, the situation becomes complicated because now several pixels could detect a given photon [7, 8] . To solve this problem we introduce here a new concept -the joint probability P ij that i-th and j-th pixels detect a photon simultaneously [9] . Using this concept together with the response function we",
    "We have analyzed the shapes of interstellar extinction curves in the infrared through ultraviolet wavelength range using data for more than 100 sight lines with known distances and reddenings, including those obtained by us at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). We find that all observed extinction curves can be fitted well by a single power law function A(lambda) = lambda -alpha , where alpha is an index ranging between 1.5 to 2.0. This result suggests that there are no significant differences among various types of interstellar dust grains as far as their optical properties are concerned. In addition, we show that the value of alpha correlates strongly with the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv . These results suggest that the shape of interstellar extinction curve may provide important information on the physical conditions of interstellar matter along individual sight lines.

    "We present new observations of the central region of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4258, which show that its nuclear disk is warped by an angle of ~20 degrees with respect to the plane of the host galaxy's stellar bulge (see Figure 1 ). The warp has been detected using near-infrared integral field spectroscopy obtained at Gemini Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. \n \n We also report the detection of significant rotation about the minor axis of this warped structure, as well as evidence for counter-rotation within the innermost few hundred parsecs of the nucleus. These results are consistent with previous studies based on optical data alone. \n \n In addition, we find that the kinematics of the gas in the outer regions of the nuclear disk can be explained if it orbits around the supermassive black hole located at the center of the galaxy under the influence of both gravitational forces and magnetic fields. This result suggests that the observed warps may have their origin in the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) operating in accretion disks surrounding massive black holes. \n \n Finally, we discuss how these findings could help us understand the physics behind the so-called \"Bardeen-Petterson effect\": i.e., the alignment between the spin axes of the stars and the angular momentum vector of the accreting material onto the central supermassive black hole.",
    "We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photometry for HD 97048, an evolved star with a dusty circumstellar environment that is surrounded by a large debris disk. The NIR spectrum shows strong emission lines in H I Paschen series as well as Brackett γ line at 2.166 µm. We also detect CO bandheads around 2.3 µm which are characteristic features of late-type stars. In addition, we find evidence of water vapor absorption bands near 1.4-1.8 µm indicating the presence of warm water vapor in the inner part of the system. \n \n Using our newly obtained data together with archival optical spectra, we have derived physical parameters such as effective temperature T eff = 8200 K, surface gravity log g = 3.9 dex, luminosity L = 4 × 10^6 Lsun, mass M = 5M⊙, radius R = 6R⊙, and age t = 7×10^7 years. These values indicate that this object belongs to the red giant branch phase on its way towards becoming a white dwarf.",
    "The standard model is the most successful theory in particle physics, but it fails to explain gravity. In this article we present an alternative approach that unifies general relativity with quantum mechanics by using a new concept called \"quantum potential energy density\" (QPD). We show how QPD can be used as a source for gravitational field equations which are derived from Hamilton's principle of least action. The resulting field equations have solutions similar to those obtained from Einstein's field equations. However, unlike Einstein's field equations, our proposed field equations do not contain any free parameters such as cosmological constant or dark matter. This means that all physical phenomena predicted by these two theories should agree exactly if they are based on the same underlying principles. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental tests of our proposal. The standard model is the most succesful theory in particle physics, however it fails to explain gravity. \n \n In this article we present another approach that unifies general relavity with quantum mechanics by introducing a new concept called “quantum potental energy density”(QPD). \n \n Quantum potential energy density has been introduced previously by several authors [1-5], but its role was limited only to explaining certain aspects of quantum mechanics like uncertainty relations [6], tunneling effect [7-9], wave-particle duality [10-12] etc.. \n \n Here we propose a novel interpretation of QPD where it plays a central role in deriving gravitational field equations. These field equations are then derived from Hamilton’s principle of least action. \n \n Our results suggest that QPD may play a fundamental role in understanding both gravity and quantum mechanics at their deepest level.",
    "We study the possibility that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by strong dynamics at an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, as suggested by gauge-Higgs unification models with warped extra dimensions. We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature [1] . It also offers a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the Planck and TeV scales [2] , since quantum corrections to the Higgs potential are cut off at the UV scale [3] .\nIn order to realize this idea in practice, however, several challenges must be overcome [4] : i) the Higgs should arise naturally out of some strongly coupled sector; ii) the Higgs couplings to SM particles should agree with experiment; iii) there should exist a mechanism to generate masses for all SM fields without introducing large hierarchies among them. These issues have been addressed recently using the Randall-Sundrum model [5] , where the Higgs field lives on the IR brane while gravity propagates into the bulk [6] - [8] . This setup allows for a calculable description of the Higgs physics [9] , but introduces additional complications due to the presence of Kaluza-Klein gravitons [10] .",
    "We consider the problem of quantizing an arbitrary vector in a Grassmannian manifold to minimize its distortion under a given rate constraint, which is relevant for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) communications systems employing feedback. We derive upper bounds on the minimum achievable distortion as well as lower bounds on the corresponding optimal rates by using information-theoretic tools such as entropy power inequalities and data processing inequalities. Our results show that the performance gap between these two bounds increases when the dimension of the underlying Grassmannian manifold grows large. Finally, we provide numerical examples illustrating our theoretical findings. The work presented here was supported by NSF Grant CCF-0635035. Multi-input-multi-output communication systems are widely used in wireless networks due to their high spectral efficiency [1] . In this context, it has been shown recently [2] , that the use of limited-rate feedback can significantly improve system performance at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, the amount of available feedback resources may be severely constrained in practice [3] .\nIn order to reduce the required feedback overhead while maintaining good performance, one approach consists of exploiting channel state information (CSI), i.e., knowledge about the current fading coefficients, to perform joint encoding across multiple transmit antennas [4] - [6] . This technique, known as spatial multiplexing or beamforming, requires CSI at both transmitter and receiver sides. Since acquiring perfect CSI at the transmitter side through training-based schemes typically involves significant signaling overhead [7] , practical implementations often resort to quantized versions of the true CSI [8]- [10] . Therefore, there exists a trade-off between the accuracy of the transmitted signals and the amount of feedback needed to convey them [11] .\nThe design of efficient transmission strategies over MIMO channels with limited feedback remains an open research area [12] . A number of recent works have focused on characterizing fundamental limits associated with different aspects of MIMO systems operating under various assumptions regarding the availability of CSI [13] - [16] . For example, [17] considers the case where only statistical information about the channel...",
    "The observed smallness of the vacuum energy density is one of the most puzzling problems in physics today, and it has been suggested that this problem may be solved by considering quantum gravity effects on the vacuum fluctuations.  In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately. This result suggests that our approach provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem. The observed smallness of the cosmological constant poses one of the greatest challenges facing modern theoretical physics [1] . It is generally believed that quantum gravity will play an important role in understanding why the vacuum energy density associated with quantum fluctuations of all fields is so much smaller than what would naively be expected [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to address this issue within the framework of loop quantum gravity [3] - [8] , but none of them seem to provide a satisfactory answer [9] . In particular, the results obtained in Refs. [6] - [8] do not agree with each other or with current experimental bounds [10] . Here we propose a new mechanism based on ideas developed recently in Ref. [11] . Our starting point is the observation that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation derived from the canonical formulation of general relativity leads to modifications of the usual Schrödinger equation when applied to states describing macroscopic systems [12] . As shown in Ref. [13] , these modifications can be interpreted as arising due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the gravitational field itself.",
    "The polarimetry of Comet Hale-Bopp was studied by the University of Hawaii 2 m telescope (UH2T) and the 1.5 m telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory in 1997-1998, using broadband filters centered on 0.55 μm, 0.65 μm, 0.85 μm, and 1.25 μm.  The results show that the polarization degree is generally low for all wavelengths except near perihelion when it increases to about 10%-15% with an angle of ~40°-50° counterclockwise relative to solar north pole. This indicates that the dust particles are aligned perpendicularly to the Sun-comet-observer line. We also find that there exists a wavelength dependence of the polarization degree which decreases as the wavelength becomes longer. These observations suggest that the size distribution of the dust grains has a power law index between -3 and -4. In addition, we found that the polarization degree shows no significant variation during the period of our observation.",
    "We consider the capacity region of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel in which each transmitter has perfect knowledge of its own instantaneous channel state information and uses a quantized precoding matrix to maximize mutual information between itself and the receiver. We show that, for any given number of transmit antennas at all transmitters, there exists an optimal number of receive antennas such that the sum-capacity is maximized when all receivers have this same number of antennas. This result holds even if the channels are correlated across time or frequency. The optimal number of receive anten-nas increases as more transmit antennas are used by the transmitters. For example, we find that using four transmit antennas results in the highest sum-rate when three receive antennas are employed per user; however, five receive antennas should be used instead if eight transmit antennas are available.",
    "We present the results of an investigation into the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of magnetic field strength in active region plage using high-resolution spectropolarimetric data obtained with Hinode/SOT-SP. We find that, on average, the magnetic field is stronger at higher heights above the solar surface (i.e., closer to the limb) than it is near disk center. The mean unsigned longitudinal magnetic flux density decreases by about 50% between 0.3′′ and 1′′ above the solar surface. This decrease occurs over a range of heliocentric angles where the photospheric plasma β increases significantly. In addition, we find evidence for significant horizontal structuring of the magnetic fields within individual pixels. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions based upon magnetohydrodynamic simulations of coronal heating driven by small-scale convective motions. Finally, we show how these observations can be used as input parameters for models of chromospheric heating via Alfvén waves generated by resonant absorption.",
    "We present photoionization models for the heliosheath, which is the region between the termination shock (TS) at ~100 AU and the solar wind termination shock (SWTS). The SWTS is located beyond 1 AU in the solar system's frame but within 0.3 AU in the rest frame of the Sun. We use these models to constrain the boundary conditions of the heliosphere using interstellar neutral hydrogen data obtained with the Lyman-alpha instrument on board the Solar Wind Anisotropy Probe (SWAP), as well as in situ measurements made near Earth during the Voyager 2 mission. Our results show that the TS distance decreases with increasing solar activity; this effect can be explained by an increase in the density of the solar wind plasma. For low solar activity levels we find that the TS distance agrees very well with previous estimates based on observations of energetic particles.",
    "We present an approach to extract the underlying physics from large sets of experimental data by using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis. The method is applied on two different examples, namely the measurement of the electrical conductivity in doped semiconductors as well as the determination of the critical temperature Tc for superconductivity in cuprates. In both cases we find that our results are consistent with theoretical predictions. We show how this new technique can be used to identify unknown parameters or even completely new phenomena which cannot be predicted theoretically at all. This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under grant number SFB/TRR 191. A central goal of modern science is to understand complex systems such as materials or living organisms through their fundamental building blocks. To achieve this aim it is necessary to develop methods which allow us to analyze huge amounts of experimental data efficiently. Here we propose a novel approach based on machine learning algorithms combined with advanced statistical tools. Our method is demonstrated on two examples: First, we study the dependence of the electrical conductivity on doping concentration in semiconductor compounds. Second, we determine the critical temperature T c for superconductivity in high-temperature cuprate oxides. For both problems we obtain results which agree very well with existing theories. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method allows one to discover previously unforeseen features in the data.",
    "The projectile fragmentation of 86Kr at 64MeV/nucleon has been studied with the INDRA multidetector in inverse kinematics using an 8cm thick natK target and a beam intensity of 1nAe. The main results are as follows:  - A total number of about 10000 events have been recorded for this experiment.  - The charge distribution is peaked around Z=40, but shows also a large contribution between 30 and 40 charges units (see fig.1 ). This indicates that the fragments produced by the break-up of 86Kr are not only light particles like neutrons or protons, but contain many intermediate mass fragments too.   - The angular distributions show two peaks corresponding to forward and backward emission respectively (see fig.2 ).  - The energy spectra present a maximum around 10-12 MeV/u which corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy per nucleon of the emitted fragments (see fig.3 ).\n- The isotopic composition of the fragments is shown on figure 4 . It can be seen that there is no significant difference between the fragment production in the forward hemisphere and in the backward one.",
    "In this work, we propose an energy-efficient cooperative transmission scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes. In particular, by exploiting channel state information (CSI) feedbacks from all the relays, the source can adjust its transmit power level according to the instantaneous CSI so as to maximize the total network lifetime while satisfying certain quality-of-service requirements. We first derive closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation between the source and each relay under different system settings. Then, using these results, we formulate the problem of maximizing the WSN's lifetime subject to minimum data rate constraints into a convex optimization framework which can be efficiently solved numerically. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that significant performance gains over conventional schemes can be achieved through the use of the proposed approach.",
    "We propose to use the concept of Maxwell's demon in order to explain how nanodevices can be used for information processing, storage or transmission. We show that this approach is useful because it allows us to understand why some devices are more efficient than others at performing these tasks. In particular we consider two types of nanodevices which have been proposed recently as candidates for quantum computers - spin chains and arrays of coupled cavities. The first type consists of an array of spins arranged on a line with nearest neighbour interactions between them while the second one has a similar structure but instead of spins it contains atoms trapped inside optical cavities. For both cases we calculate their efficiency using the Landauer principle. Finally we discuss possible experimental implementations of our ideas. Introduction:-The idea of Maxwell's demon was introduced by James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) [1] . It describes a hypothetical intelligent being who could control microscopic particles individually so that they would always move into separate containers depending on whether each particle had a higher energy level or lower energy level [2] .\nMaxwell's demon is usually described as a thought experiment whose purpose is to demonstrate that entropy cannot decrease spontaneously [3] , i.e., that heat does not flow spontaneously from hot bodies to cold ones [4] . However, there exists another interpretation of Maxwell's demon according to which he imagined a device capable of sorting individual molecules based on their velocities [5] . This interpretation leads naturally to the question about what sort of physical system might behave like such a device [6] ."
