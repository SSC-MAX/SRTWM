Introduction  \nIn this work, we consider the following stochastic differential equation that describes the motion of a one-dimensional particle, which is influenced by frictional forces and a periodically varying potential energy V(x). This potential energy is modulated by a stochastic process W(t), where x = {x(t), t ∈ R} denotes the particle's position coordinate; γ > 0 represents the friction coefficient; f(x) describes the deterministic part of the potential energy, while g(x) represents its stochastic part.",
