Over the past three decades, this counterintuitive phenomenon has been verified experimentally and aligns with theories from various nonlinear systems, including both experimental and theoretical studies. Recent research has focused on information transmission through superthreshold stochastic resonance, where the signal exceeds a certain threshold level.",
