INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nIn this study, we examine a stochastic differential equation that models the motion of a particle in one dimension, influenced by friction and a periodically varying potential, V(x). This potential is further modulated by a random process W(t). Here, x = {x(t), t ∈ R} represents the position of the particle, γ > 0 denotes the friction coefficient, f(x) describes the deterministic component of the potential energy, and g(x) represents its stochastic element.",
