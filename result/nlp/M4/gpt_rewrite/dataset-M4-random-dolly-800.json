Key concepts and constructions are detailed within this framework. Framed bicategories are presented as enriched categories, while fibers function as two-categories. Additionally, 2-cells are identified as 2-morphisms, and 2-groups are described as fibers of strict monoidal functors. The Morita equivalence of 2-groups corresponds to isomorphisms among related strict monoidal functors. Crossed modules of 2-groups represent monoidal deformations of these 2-groups. The document also discusses monoidal fibrations between framed bicategories, the relationship of strict monoidal functors between these bicategories, and conditions under which additional equations yield fibrations with 2-groupoid fibers. Generalizations of these concepts are included, and appendices offer technical results for further clarity.",
