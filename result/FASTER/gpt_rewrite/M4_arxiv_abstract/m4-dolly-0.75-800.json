We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

        "rewrite_text": "The observed spectra of black holes may feature several components, one of which is thermal radiation. String theory suggests that the corresponding dual representation involves a gas of strings and particles known as fuzzballs. This indicates that the evaporation of white holes leads not merely to the formation of a black hole with a specific temperature, but rather to a fuzzy black hole made up of various non-commutative segments. Specifically, we propose that the Barbero-Immirzi constant for fuzzballs can be accurately defined as the string statistical constant, /b/ = 2π/3. We support this assertion with compelling circumstantial evidence by demonstrating the semiclassical maximum of state degeneracy (the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) derived from fundamental principles of string theory. Our analysis shows that the spectrum and symmetries of the lowest lying states correspond well with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which relates to the thermal state through a Penrose process. Additionally, we find that the entropy of small black holes can be accounted for by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, suggesting that the decay of a small black hole results from the fission of a larger fuzzball. Our findings confirm that fuzzballs represent the suitable structures in string theory that align with the conventional understanding of black holes. Furthermore, since the fuzzball partition function is anticipated to exhibit an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi constant, we also identify /b/ as a physical observable within string theory.",

However, computing these models can be challenging, primarily because they often rely on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. Recently, a new approach utilizing the variational inference (VI) algorithm has shown promise in effectively calculating the approximate posterior for Bayesian deformer models. In this study, we present a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) grounded in the VI framework to improve computational efficiency. Our method is first formulated within the context of general Bayesian deformable theory and subsequently applied to specific Bayesian deformer models for validation.

In this work, we introduce a new technique to study NESSs in quantum lattice systems that is particularly well suited to application to large systems and sparse matrices. Our method, the solution of the matrix product operator (MPO) equations of motion, is built upon a two-fold expansion: an expansion in the size of the underlying matrix product state (MPS) representation and an expansion in Chebyshev polynomials. This allows us to capture dynamics in large, complex quantum systems that are represented by very sparse matrices. We apply our technique to the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a paradigmatic model of quantum phase transitions. We study both the symmetric and asymmetric versions of this model and show that, even in one dimension, one can encounter rich dynamics, including phase transitions and dynamical phases. We also study the hard-core bosons on the square lattice using a quantum simulator and find excellent agreement between our results and those from exact diagonalization. Finally, we use this approach to study the solution of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model at finite temperature. We find, contrary to previous conjectures, that this model does not exhibit a phase with broken symmetries.

One of the most popular models that has enjoyed great success in reproducing the observed particle spectrum is the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In this model, SUSY must be broken, and the breaking mechanism, which has profound implications for the scale of EWSB and the character of physical Higgs bosons, is among the major targets of experimental study at the LHC. The MSSM Higgs sector comprises two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons, Hplus and Hminus.

The large sparticle masses predicted by the mSUGRA model motivate a particular benchmark region known as the focus point region, which exhibits relatively light Higgs bosons, in particular a 126 GeV Higgs boson. The observation of a Higgs boson with these characteristics would be a strong indication of supersymmetry and would greatly strengthen the case for this mysterious energy scale.

        "rewrite_text": "Self-organized GeMn nano-columns were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, along with advanced X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. These columns were formed through chemical vapor deposition on Ge (100) substrates at 300 °C, resulting in pillars with an estimated size of approximately 30 nm. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging indicates that the GeMn columns develop through the deposition of small grains on larger ones. Tomographic analysis via transmission electron microscopy reveals that these smaller grains are enriched in manganese compared to the substrate structure. The GeMn composition varies significantly across the columns. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the GeMn columns contain substantial amounts of interstitial manganese atoms, which are likely influential in determining the ferromagnetic properties of the material. The self-assembly process during the growth of the GeMn columns provides a means to tailor their structure and shape, which in turn has a significant impact on their magnetic characteristics. Notably, the pillars exhibit a considerable concentration of interstitial manganese atoms that are presumably responsible for their ferromagnetic behavior.",

In this Letter, we present an updated dynamics-controlled truncation scheme aimed at identifying high-dimensional chaotic attractors in semiconductor lasers equipped with saturable absorbers. By implementing a dynamics-dependent truncation approach, we can truncate lengthy transient turbulent orbits using turbulent solutions derived from low-dimensional truncation schemes. This technique allows us to uncover new dynamical interactions in semiconductor lasers with saturable absorbers, including intermittency and bifurcations transitioning from toroidal to odd attractors. Our methodology is applicable to any large-dimensional nonlinear system. We specifically focus on the semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber and an external periodic force (SA + EFP).

By configuring the external periodic force modulation as a limit-cycle oscillation, we can generate a chaotic attractor within the 1DMA. When truncating the dynamics at a certain dimension, we can readily observe long transient turbulent orbits in the 1DMA. Moreover, limit-cycle oscillations are consistently present in the truncated system. The truncation dimension influences the duration of the chaotic orbit's transient state; a higher truncation dimension results in longer transient turbulent orbits, thereby enabling the observation of more fascinating dynamical interactions. For instance, when the transient turbulent orbit is sufficiently prolonged, intermittency and bifurcations can be clearly observed, transitioning from toroidal to odd attractors. However, if the transient turbulent orbit is excessively long, the dynamic behavior of the laser may become obscured.",

Thus, even when the logic formula is over a small set of variables, model checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HOF logic) is np-hard. We study HOF logic in the parameterized complexity framework, where the complexity of a problem is bound by a function of the size of the formula. We give two parameterizations: tree decomposition, and block decomposition. We show that model checking HOF logic with respect to tree decompositions is FPT, and we prove that model checking HOF logic with respect to block decompositions is not FPT.

Future observations of Teegarden's Star will enhance our understanding of these models and improve predictions of luminosities for ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages. Additionally, we assess the colors and luminosity function of the new T dwarfs, relating our findings to prior studies. We note a possible shift in the ratio of T dwarfs at fainter magnitudes (H through L class) and a potential scarcity of T dwarfs around the 2MASS absolute J-band magnitude of 7.5. However, due to the limited sample size and significant photometric errors at these lower magnitudes, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. We expect this research will contribute to existing spectroscopic and photometric dwarf catalogs and serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into ultracool dwarfs.",

Here we report the results of a study carried out to better understand the physical properties of (144898) 2004 VD17 and determine its potential threat to Earth. To achieve this, observations of 2004 VD17 were acquired over two days using the Siding Springs Observatory, complemented by Earth-based radar observations from the Arecibo and Goldstone Observatories and high-resolution visual observations from the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory (UAO). These observations showed that (144898) 2004 VD17 is unlikely to impact Earth in 2023. Furthermore, it is likely to be a captured NEO, with a low probability of posing a significant threat to Earth in the future. Observations of (144898) 2004 VD17 indicate that it is most likely a captured asteroid whose orbit becomes unstable and cross that of Earth every few hundred years. The identification of 2004 VD17 only twelve months prior to its next near-Earth pass in 2023 suggests that it may not be stable on current orbit. This research highlights the utility of wide area surveys in the discovery of potentially hazardous objects.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion.

Analyzing the light spectrum emitted by these supernovae is a powerful method for revealing the characteristics of their progenitors, providing direct evidence for the existence of a stellar wind from the progenitor's rapidly expanding main sequence phase, or indicating a core-collapse event. Despite many years of research, the nature of the most common progenitors for core-collapse supernovae remains contentious; some subtypes are linked to massive (~8-[UNK]) main sequence stars. Type Ia supernovae, in particular, have been extensively studied in cosmology and are associated with a debated progenitor type: brown dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion star. Additionally, luminous blue variables (LBVs), the progenitors of ~8-[UNK] stars, have been proposed as a second, less understood category of core-collapse supernova progenitors.

The ages of the LBV and the supernova are similar, and recent findings suggest that the progenitor of the supernova might have been an LBV—simulations indicate that a rare collapse of an LBV, occurring approximately 200 days before the supernova, likely marked the transition to a compact object. Moreover, a recent discovery of the remnant from an LBV explosion, about 30-60 days post-outburst, provides credible support for the idea that LBV explosions can lead to supernovae.

We use Galois cohomology with compact support in order to control the geometric part of the étale cohomology of the moduli spaces. By combining our results with previous work of Kevin Hutchinson, we deduce that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of surfaces. Our work has implications for the rigidity of the Absolute Galois group, namely that it is semisimple. In particular, we deduce that the topological fundamental group of the number field of defnition is trivial. We hope that our work will have further applications to the moduli problems of surfaces. For example, we use our results to deduce that the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of surfaces is nef and big, and so gives rise to a semi-stable family of curves. Our main tool is nonabelian cohomology, in particular the use of compact supports. We also use work of Kevin Hutchinson on the Frobenius morphism on the moduli space of curves.

We employ Galois cohomology with compact support to enhance the geometric aspect of the étale cohomology of these moduli spaces. By integrating our results with earlier work by Kevin Hutchinson, we establish that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of surfaces, indicating implications for the rigidity of the Absolute Galois group, particularly that it is semisimple. Specifically, we conclude that the topological fundamental group of the defining number field is trivial. We anticipate that our research will contribute further to the study of moduli problems for surfaces. For example, we utilize our findings to demonstrate that the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of surfaces is nef and huge, thereby leading to a semi-stable family of curves. Our primary method revolves around nonabelian cohomology, especially through the use of smooth supports.

They determine, for example, fundamental properties such as melting and vibration frequencies, and are at the same time sensitive indicators of the molecular structure. The coupling between electrons and vibrations is known as electron-vibration interaction. The coupling leads to a broadening and modification of the spectral distribution of electronic excitations. The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Here, we present the first calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant in covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion. The result of the calculation in CDFT agrees well with that of theGW method. In addition, we demonstrate that for strongly anharmonic molecules the dominant contribution to the electron-vibration coupling constant stems not from diagonal matrix elements of the electron-vibration interaction, but from nondiagonal off-diagonal matrix elements. These off-diagonal matrix elements are induced by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface. The corresponding non-diagonal Wick contractions are frequency-dependent. Our result indicates that anharmonic effects must be included in a fully consistent calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant.",

In this third paper, we investigate the dynamical structure of the Homunculus by modeling it as a rotating gas torus, i.e. a donut.

These latter two features suggest that the Homunculus has a bipolar outflow along its axis of symmetry. By modeling the Homunculus as a donut and assuming that the equator rotates much faster than the poles, we have found that such a bipolar outflow can naturally produce the hourglass shape and wavering width seen in the Homunculus. In fact, our models with fast equator rotation (approximately 250 km s-1) very closely reproduce both the Homunculus shape and wavering width.

Since its discovery, the Homunculus has displayed notable asymmetry, characterized by a prominent hourglass-shaped structure and a broad, fluctuating bipolar head. These features imply a bipolar outflow along its symmetry axis. By treating the Homunculus like a donut and positing that the equatorial regions rotate significantly faster than the poles, we have found that such a bipolar outflow can naturally create the observed hourglass shape and varying dimensions. Our estimates, assuming rapid equatorial rotation of about 250 km/s, closely match both the position and the fluctuating width of the Homunculus.

Compared to the local luminous quasars, these highest-redshift objects have extremely high space density, and therefore are excellent tools with which to investigate the growth of supermassive black holes and their host bulges and galaxies. We find that the highest-redshift quasars have similar X-ray properties to those at low redshift, but with broad EWs and X-ray luminosities that are a factor of ~10 higher. This emission is most plausibly interpreted as thermal coronal gas in the host galaxies with broad emission lines.

The small difference in radio emission may indicate that, at high redshift, quasars have less obscured nuclei than locally. We suggest that this may be due to the brighter cosmic background at high redshift, which can penetrate more easily through a putative torus.

The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

Observations of eclipses and dips, along with highly polarized alpha-ray radiation and a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object remains obscured for most of the time, revealing itself only briefly as it spirals toward the companion star. The dynamic interactions within this system have sparked debate among researchers, with some supporting the idea of a third body and others advocating for a colliding-wind model. In the colliding-wind scenario, the stellar wind from the companion star compresses a dense circumbinary disk surrounding the black hole, which accounts for much of the emitted gamma-ray radiation. In this paper, we evaluate these two models through a blend of statistical simulations and analytical calculations. Our analysis reveals that the accretion theory, although simpler than the colliding-wind theory, more effectively explains the multiwavelength statistical data. This accretion theory assumes an accretion disk fed by material from the companion star, with this material directed toward the black hole via a heated, poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The capture process is significantly eccentric relative to the black hole's orbital plane, providing a consistent yet irregular influx of material to the disk. Thermal friction between the disk and the black hole's magnetic field diminishes the formation of a thin external disk and facilitates efficient high-energy emissions through synchrotron or magnetically confined jet mechanisms. In contrast, the colliding-wind model suggests that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, whose fast-moving wind collides with the slower wind from the O-type star companion. This system also exhibits strong eccentricity, with the periastron being where the winds interact. Although evidence for colliding winds exists in more massive galaxies, we demonstrate that such an interaction can also occur with lower-mass companions, leading to observable emissions. However, the area of emission in the colliding-wind model is small and localized, while LS I + 61 303’s tight orbit necessitates a more distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that the colliding-wind model fails to replicate the multiwavelength spectral power distribution of LS I + 61 303 and indicates that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

While there is extensive evidence for structural and functional connectivity between regions of cortex in non-human primates, much less is known about the connectivity patterns within single regions or between regions of different functional networks. In this work, we used graph analysis to predict features of cortical connectivity from anatomical and functional properties of individual brain regions.

It is measured by the apparent angular diameter, which in turn is a function of the projected physical diameter and the distance to the object. Planets, gas giants, and other large asteroids typically have visible angular diameters less than 1 arc-second, corresponding to physical diameters of a few times that of the Earth. However, when considering smaller objects in the solar system, such as comets, asteroids, and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), their sizes become much more difficult to determine. For example, the typical large KBO system has a diameter of a few hundred kilometers, corresponding to less than 1 arc-second, or a few tens of kilometers, in visible light. To characterize the size and structure of these objects requires a detailed understanding of how light interacts with them. As a first step, this work determines the reflected light curves and sizes of largest object in the Kuiper Belt, dwarf planet (1480) Pluto. Using observations in the visible and infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the apparent diameters of Pluto and Charon as a function of phase angle, and produce the first light curves of Pluto and Charon. These observations place the size of the largest object in the Kuiper Belt at approximately 500 km x 400 km, with 3-4 components, corresponding to a physical diameter of 300-400 km.

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass.

In this study, we analyze Milky Way globular clusters using high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey, which includes 23 clusters in the Fornax star cluster. Our findings reveal that the cluster color-metallicity relation is more pronounced than that found in current studies of the Milky Way halo field populations. We demonstrate that the color-metallicity relationships in Milky Way galaxies can be characterized as a function of the mass of their host spheroids. This experimental framework shows that Milky Way clusters reached their peak metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and we find no evidence of a gradient in stellar community metallicity within individual clusters. We propose that the strongest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is due to the deeper gravitational wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity increasing similarly across clusters regardless of host galaxy mass. Additionally, we compare our results with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding that the maximum metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters aligns with the highest values observed in simulated galaxy cluster cores.

This study represents the first measurement of chemical evolution in the early universe beyond the EUCLID satellite’s observational capabilities and is expected to remain the most precise assessment until future observations of galaxies at significantly higher redshifts are made possible by the James Webb Space Telescope or other forthcoming instruments.",

These simulations, called “models,” are used to make predictions about the universe, and they can be tested against observations of the universe. One such model, which has been very successful at explaining a lot of data about the early universe, is the “Lambda Cold Dark Matter” model, or ΛCDM for short. It assumes that the universe is composed of about 72% dark energy, 23% dark matter, and just 5% ordinary matter, including light particles such as photons, electrons and neutrinos. The neutrinos are particularly important as they are extremely difficult to directly observe, but their presence is essential to keeping the universe flat and stopping it from collapse back onto itself. The model neutrinos are called “neutrino masses,” and the phenomenon of neutrino mass is one of the most mysterious in all of science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detected a significant decrease in the speed of neutrinos moving through space-time, which suggested that neutrinos might have a tiny but non-zero mass. Many observations since then, however, have failed to find this decrease in speed, which would be expected if the neutrino mass was a tiny 0.1eV. On the other hand, various extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos might have a non-zero mass. These include the see-saw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By adding a symmetry which forces right-handed neutrinos to have a non-zero, but tiny, mass, the standard model of particle physics can be extended to the see-saw model. Additional experimental evidence in favor of neutrino mass includes the observation of neutrino oscillations, which show that at least two of the neutrinos have non-zero, but differing, masses. Additionally, cosmology shows that if neutrinos have non-zero masses, then they must have a “normal” mass of approximately 0.05eV or less. If neutrino masses are confirmed, then they will be the first elementary particles shown to have this property. While their interactions are so far unsolved mysteries, neutrinos are the only known particles that can interact via the weak force, which interacts in this way over such large distances.

A prominent example is the “Lambda Cold Dark Matter” model, abbreviated as ΛCDM, which effectively accounts for much of the evidence related to the early universe. This model posits that the universe is made up of approximately 72% dark energy, 23% dark matter, and only 5% ordinary matter, predominantly comprising light particles like photons, electrons, and neutrinos. Neutrinos are particularly significant due to their elusive nature, making them difficult to observe fully; however, they play a crucial role in keeping the universe flat and preventing its collapse. Theoretical neutrinos, denoted as “neutrino masses,” represent one of the most enigmatic phenomena in science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) recorded a noticeable decrease in the speed of neutrinos traveling through spacetime, suggesting they might possess a small, but non-zero mass. Subsequent experiments, however, have been unable to replicate this speed reduction, which would be expected if neutrino masses were indeed around 0.1 eV. Conversely, various extensions of standard particle theory, including the seesaw mechanism, imply that neutrinos could have non-zero mass. This mechanism introduces right-handed neutrinos and incorporates a symmetry that permits them to have a tiny mass, thus expanding the standard particle theory into the seesaw model. Further experimental support for neutrino masses comes from observations of neutrino oscillations, indicating that at least two neutrino types have non-zero and variable masses. Additionally, cosmological data suggest that if neutrinos do possess mass, it must be “normal,” approximately 0.05 eV or less. Confirmation of neutrino masses would mark the first time that elementary particles are shown to have this attribute. Although their interactions remain largely mysterious, neutrinos are unique in that they are the only known particles that mediate interactions via the weak force over vast distances.

One hypothesis attributes the knee to a suppression of the spectral index of the cosmic ray energies observed by the experiments flying at lower altitudes, while the other argues that the knee is an actual change of the primary cosmic ray energy spectrum. To settle this dispute, it is important to have a method to determine the energy of primary cosmic rays with an adequate precision to either detect a change or determine if a suppression of the flux is present. The GAMMA (Gamma-ray Astronomy in the Initiative Era) experiment, designed for the detection of gamma-rays produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, can contribute to this problem because, in contrast to most other cosmic ray experiments, it is able to measure the energy of primary cosmic rays with an absolute accuracy of approximately 30%. In this work, we present spectra of primary cosmic rays measured by the GAMMA experiment for four different rigidities of the experimental setup.

Calculations were performed using the method of rapid adiabaticfollowing, which permits the description of non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a mixed normal-Wigner representation Hamiltonian. The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position. These two structures differ by the orientation of the molecular axis. In the following, we will refer to the 2x2 O2 structure as “bent” and to the 1x2 O2 structure as “linear”. Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments. This excitation could also lead to the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localised on top of the linear structure is initially involved in the dissociation process, in good agreement with available experimental data. This means that the associative pathway is adiabatic. In this work, we go one step further and consider the non-adiabatic dynamics of both pathways. For that purpose",

The role of the substrate in the dissociation process is also examined. Notably, these simulations provide the first insights into the non-adiabatic dissociation of O2 on the Al(111) surface. The findings indicate that while the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, the associative pathway remains adiabatic until reaching the transition state. Strong non-adiabatic coupling is observed at the onset of the transition state in the dissociative pathway, whereas such coupling is negligible in the associative pathway. Additionally, the simulations highlight the significant influence of the substrate on the dissociation process, revealing that the Al(111) surface supports two stable arrangements of the O2 molecule: the 1x2 and 2x2 configurations. The 1x2 configuration is characterized by a linear geometry with the oxygen atom positioned at the top and the two hydrogen atoms in a bridge position, while the 2x2 configuration features a bent structure with the oxygen atom in a secondary position.

A sufficiently high energy excitation can prompt the rearrangement of the molecular axis into a 1x2 configuration, directing it towards the substrate. The atomic wavepacket associated with this excitation exhibits high frequency at the top position in the linear configuration and diminishes at the bridge position. Our simulations suggest that the molecular axis aligns above the bridge position of the Al surface, consistent with experimental observations.

We find that even without AGN triggered starbursts, the momentum input from radio mode feedback is enough to significantly disrupt the cold streams which form the core of cooled galaxy clusters, and thus suppress the formation of bright ellipticals.

        "original_text": "We report the detection of six magnetically-driven explosions of rapidly-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) following accretion-induced collapse. The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions. We also determined the probable locations of the progenitor stars by cross-referencing our sample to Gaia Data Release 2 and found that four of the exploding WDs had most likely been observed in the field of view of their respective host galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs are more likely to be detectable from their host galaxies than explosions from low-mass WDs.

        "rewrite_text": "We present our findings on six magnetically-triggered explosions of rapidly spinning white dwarfs (WDs) following instabilities caused by accretion. This observation was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual observatory, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Notably, these explosions had not been previously documented in these types of objects, as all earlier instances involved low-density WDs. The explosions are characterized by a swift increase in brightness leading up to the event, reaching a peak before a subsequent decline in intensity. This plateau in brightness is attributed to the white dwarf’s ongoing gravitational collapse into a neutron star or black hole. The presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve indicates the explosion, which is absent in cases of stable nuclear burning on the surface of WDs. The duration and luminosity of the plateau align with the expected range for the mass of material ejected during these events. We analyzed the observations using 1D hydrodynamical simulations of collapse due to accretion, both with and without significant magnetic fields, concluding that the emission patterns were best replicated by simulations that incorporated magnetic fields. Our calculations suggest that the magnetic fields required to trigger these explosions are approximately 100 MG, a level that could be produced by potential magnetoreactor systems like the Exawatt Center for Plasma Research in the EU and NASA's long-distance balloon program. \n\nIn our study, we identified six rapidly spinning WDs, all previously observed by ASAS-SN. Among these, four displayed light curves with plateau characteristics and distinct decreases in intensity prior to the explosions, which aligns with earlier observations of magnetically-triggered explosions in smaller mass WDs. Additionally, two other objects, SDSS J0804 + 2052 and SDSS J2315 + 1855, showed clear plateau-like declines in brightness without the preceding brightening phase, providing the first evidence for magnetically-driven explosions in rapidly spinning WDs. We compared the durations and luminosities of the observed plateaus with our simulations, finding that the energy emissions were effectively replicated in models that included magnetic fields. By analyzing our plateau measurements, we estimated the mass of material ejected during each explosion, which fell within the expected range for such events. Furthermore, we cross-referenced our observations with Gaia Data Release 2 to identify likely progenitor star locations, revealing that four of the exploding WDs had likely been observed within the fields of their host galaxies. This supports the notion that explosions from swiftly spinning WDs are easier to detect than those from high-density WDs. Our results indicate that magnetic waves significantly influence the mechanisms and outcomes of these explosions, suggesting that such events are a probable means for rapidly spinning WDs to retain mass.",

In this paper, we explore the fundamental properties of QKZP. First, we demonstrate that this concept can be accurately expressed within the framework of complexity theory. Using this understanding, we establish that a PSPACE assumption is necessary for the definition. We further show that it is impractical to construct a valid QKZP with an advantage greater than 2/3 when relying solely on black-box access to the preceding method. These findings suggest the inherent limitations of QKZP. Additionally, we propose a version of QKZP that features an enhanced soundness property, which presents its own intriguing challenges for verification.",

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface. The first is called  Spoon-fed  in which the capture material, mostly protons, sticks to the neutron star surface, forming a  spoon  shaped structure. Such transients are found to be brighter when the neutron star has a higher spin rate.

        "rewrite_text": "The title of the paper encapsulates the primary focus of the abstract, which is extensive due to its inclusion of background information on the topic and overall insights into the paper. A neutron star refers to a celestial body primarily composed of neutrons—subatomic particles that correspond to the atomic number of individual nuclei. These stars possess an extraordinary density, containing more mass than the Sun within a volume of approximately one cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars form as a consequence of a supernova explosion, occurring when nearly 99% of a star's mass has collapsed into its core. Such extreme densities arise because neutrons are significantly denser than typical atoms, and the strong nuclear force that holds nuclei together diminishes as one approaches the core. When the surrounding disk accumulates about 2 to 3 solar masses, it no longer has enough mass to counteract the gravitational pull on the core, leading to the release of energy in a supernova explosion, often associated with the formation of a neutron star.\n\nMost neutron stars reside in close binary systems alongside another neutron star or a more common black hole. These configurations are identified as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs present fascinating opportunities for study as they allow researchers to observe neutron stars from two different perspectives. The first is referred to as the quiescent state, where the neutron star orbits a more compact partner without emitting significant X-ray radiation. The second perspective occurs during a transient outburst, characterized by a temporary surge in X-ray emissions. Investigating the transitions between these two states reveals intriguing differences. For instance, we have observed that brighter transient outbursts correspond with an increase in the neutron star's spin period. Conversely, during quiescent phases when X-ray emissions are significantly elevated, the spin period exceeds that of phases with much fainter emissions.\n\nThese behavioral variations have led to the proposal of a two-state theory governing the dynamics of LMXBs. In this framework, two distinct accretion regimes onto the neutron star are described, differing primarily in how the captured material is deposited onto its surface. The first regime, termed \"Spoon-cut,\" occurs when escaping material, mostly protons, adheres to the neutron star's surface, forming a spoon-shaped structure. These transient states are found to emit brighter signals when the neutron star spins at higher velocities. The second regime, known as \"Indirect,\" involves the captured material, primarily electrons and protons, creating a mist around the neutron star. In this scenario, brighter transients are observed when the neutron star is in an active state.",

In typical cosmological models, the observed heat of the CMB arises from photons produced after the decoupling of free electrons that comprise the CMB. These photons traverse the observable universe before reaching us. Consequently, the temperature we observe in the CMB reflects the total energy of all particles created prior to their interactions. If the universe were strictly four-dimensional without additional space-time dimensions, power conservation would be preserved, as all energy would remain within the universe. However, if our universe exists within an AdS LED with a negative cosmological function, this conservation is disrupted due to the brane world dynamics that generate AdS LEDs.",

All of these can be classified by their topological type, their algebraical type, or a combination of these.

Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space. A comprehensive theory of singular curves was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, see in particular the works of Harris and points of view of Coppo and Garrone. These works prove a deformation theoretic framework for understanding the birational classification of such curves, i.e. their ability to be infinitesimally deformed into another one. This framework implies also that for a generic choice of a curve, there is a plane in the nine-dimensional projective space of quadric hypersurfaces that the curve doesn’t intersect, and such a plane is called an exceptional plane. Curves with exceptional planes are called decomposable. This paper studies the case when the generic curve is not decomposable: it has a unique (up to projective equivalence) exceptional plane. Such curves are called non-decomposable. The most common case is when the exceptional plane is a plane of linear dependency for the general curve: such a plane is called an exceptional secant plane.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in network clustering, sparked by the development of a wide variety of network data, as well as the ubiquity of network datasets in other fields, such as social media and biology. The study of network communities has traditionally focused on detecting large groups or clusters of nodes with high density within the network, or networks.

Recent interest in system clustering has been spurred by the emergence of diverse system data and the widespread availability of datasets from various fields, including social media and biology. Traditionally, research on network populations has aimed at identifying large clusters of nodes characterized by high internal density. However, community detection methods are sensitive to a resolution parameter that dictates the granularity of the clusters identified. While a higher resolution typically reveals more nuanced clusters, it often requires algorithms that are computationally intensive. Our hierarchical method addresses these challenges by detecting super-communities—large, densely connected clusters that interact minimally with other super-communities—and refining the clustering process at multiple resolution levels. This allows for the identification of both large and small populations effectively.

The remaining four quarks—strange, bottom, and two others—exist in combinations called hadrons, which are held together exclusively by the strong force. This force binds the quarks within protons and neutrons, and the binding energy of a hadron is equivalent to its mass. Quarks can be thought of as tiny magnets, each available in six different \"colors,\" which are representations of the SU(3) symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

For example, up and down quarks have charges of +2/3 and -1/3, respectively. The other flavors—strange and bottom—are associated with hadrons of their own. These hadron names can be combined to form larger hadrons. For instance, a bottom hadron, which contains a bottom quark, interacts weakly. In the standard model of particle physics, quarks are considered point-like particles, with their strong interactions described by QCD. This theoretical framework effectively explains various characteristics of hadrons, including their spectra and decay processes. A key implication of QCD is that up and down quarks never exist in isolation; they always combine to form hadrons, a phenomenon known as confinement. According to the quark model, the most significant quarks in the universe are up, down, and strange, along with their corresponding hadrons. Hadrons constitute normal matter, which is prevalent throughout the universe in celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies.

This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density. This provides a mechanism by which the universe can undergo a phase transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of nonequilibrium, or a cooling dominated phase transition.",

This radiation holds tremendous scientific significance, as it represents the last photons emitted following the Big Bang, making it crucial for studying the conditions of the early universe. Recently, researchers have proposed a theory suggesting that this background radiation may be influenced by quantum mechanical effects occurring within the universe. The model envisions the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, where particles occupy every conceivable (virtual) position within this framework. As the universe expands and its temperature decreases, these virtual particles gain greater freedom to settle into low-energy states, resulting in a background of virtual radiation. However, a major limitation of this theory is that it frames the universe as a collection of waves rather than atoms. This can be likened to representing the ocean as a cluster of sticks floating atop a boiling pot of water, where the waves symbolize the currents of the ocean and the sticks represent the molecules in the boiling water. The supposed currents of this model have yet to be observed. In this analogy, the atoms in the boiling water represent the photons of cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, these photons increasingly occupy low-energy states, reaching equilibrium with the cooler environment. Once the universe's temperature falls below 3000 K, the photons cease to interact with quantum fluctuations and begin to free-stream, departing from dense regions toward less dense areas. This is similar to how water molecules in a cooling container settle toward the bottom, creating a space with lower volume compared to the surrounding atmosphere. In our research, we propose an alternative model in which the photons (molecules) remain static while the background radiation continues to propagate. In this scenario, the universe resembles a frozen sea where the particles settle at the bottom, yet radiation waves propagate throughout. As the universe cools, radiation particles persist in their movement while the matter settles, creating regions of varying density. This provides a mechanism for the universe to transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to one of nonequilibrium, characterized by a cooling-driven phase shift.",

        "rewrite_text": "A new autonomous entry control scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF is introduced, designed to intelligently distribute channel capacity and enhance wireless medium utilization efficiency while maximizing the available bandwidth. This admission management framework comprises a controlling mechanism and a controlled algorithm. The controlling mechanism divides the network into multiple virtual channels of specified sizes by assigning various channel availability priorities. Each station within the network monitors the wireless medium to assess the corresponding transmission data levels. Subsequently, the controlled algorithm identifies the optimal sites for establishing connections based on their network requirements and reallocates the entire channel across different virtual channels according to the scheduling results. Simulation results indicate a significant improvement in channel utilization efficiency. The complete paper can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02605. The proposed scheme effectively creates virtual channels to segment the overall network. The managed algorithm reallocates the entire channel among different virtual channels based on scheduling outcomes, leading to enhanced channel utilization efficiency. \n\nReference: \n1.

These droplets form through the capture of gaseous metal atoms by broken dust grains. We perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this process and find that, as the gas is enriched, the droplets grow in mass and radius.

The growth rate of the droplets is influenced by the local metal concentration, establishing a self-regulating mechanism for ISM enrichment. By utilizing observational data on C II activity within our Galaxy and its vicinity, we demonstrate that the resulting growth trajectories for droplets align with the observed information.

We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles.

In this theory the charm quark interacts with the quantum fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, which simulates the gluon field in the underlying gauge theory. We find that the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a charged pion can be well approximated by considering the Schrödinger equation for a simple potential model, where the coupling between quark and diquark is parametrized by an effective coupling constant. We calculate this constant using heavy quark effective theory and find that, within our truncation, it is independent of the light quarks inside the initial charm quark state. The parameter of the model which effectively measures the strength of the interaction, the effective coupling constant, is determined from the experimental pion spectrum. We also calculate the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a kaon.

We explore how the charm quark interacts with the quantum fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, which serves as a representation of the gluon field in fundamental gauge theory. Our findings indicate that the fragmentation process from a charm quark to a charged pion can be accurately modeled using the Schrödinger equation within a simple potential framework. In this model, the interaction between the quark and diquark is parameterized using an effective correlation function, which we determine via heavy quark effective theory. Our analysis reveals that, given our truncation, this constant is independent of the light quarks present around the charm quark's initial position. The model's variable that quantifies the interaction strength, known as the effective correlation parameter, is derived from empirical data on the pion spectrum. We also calculate the fragmentation relation for the transition from a charm quark to a kaon. By comparing our results with recent evidence from LHCb, we discover a significantly larger effective bonding coefficient for the transition to a kaon than for a charged pion.

The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours. We demonstrate the utility of the steady-state space use area by comparing it to the area estimated using MHRA and by using it to reduce the number of model runs necessary to estimate home range size.",

This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community. Since 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals. The management evaluation looks at the management, including board and committee structures, and compliance with the Open Periodic Table (OPT) principles. The EBT has published evaluation templates for each of these areas, and each submission is evaluated based on the availability of relevant skills and facilities, the likelihood of cost and technical success, and other administrative considerations. Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost. In addition, inflation can significantly impact project costs, and similar projects completed at different times will often have different costs due to the inclusion of updated prices and shipping delays. Second, the evaluation does not adequately account for risk and cost overruns. As a result, the proposal evaluation does not fully represent the true cost of building a telescope, which can be particularly relevant in the case of international projects, where local political or economic factors can lead to",

First, the cost evaluation inadequately captures the expenses involved, as it does not account for inflation adjustments, necessary contingency periods, or the rising costs of capital equipment over time. These oversights can result in an overall misestimation of costs, as projects often require additional resources for system or equipment design analyses, detailed construction plans, or other factors that escalate expenses. Furthermore, inflation can significantly influence program costs, leading to disparate expenses for related projects completed at different times due to updated rates and transportation delays. Second, the evaluation process insufficiently considers risks and potential cost overruns. Consequently, the proposal evaluations do not accurately represent the true expenses involved in constructing a telescope, which is especially pertinent for international projects where local political or economic factors may impact costs.",

Several classes of such scenarios are based on extended gravity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity (dS/PSR) scenarios. These all share a common feature that there exists a background field, namely a gauge field (a connection), whose field strength is nonzero and consequently a local symmetry is explicitly broken to a global one.

Many of these scenarios are associated with extended gravity frameworks, such as Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR) and minimal de Sitter and Projective Special Relativity (dS/PSR) contexts. A common feature among these scenarios is the presence of a background gauge field (connection) with non-zero field intensity which explicitly breaks the local symmetry to a global one.

This insight allows for the derivation of fundamental characteristics of DR systems, irrespective of the specifics of the symmetry breaking process. For instance, it is expected that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will lead to a diminished local symmetry, with the local symmetry shift parameter transitioning into a Goldstone boson. In the cases of reduced de Sitter and Projective Special Relativity, a precise symmetry exists between local de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, yielding similar Goldstone boson behavior.

We start by presenting an outbreak model based on general time-varying graphs, analyzing the ultimate size of the outbreak. Our research focuses on two specific applications of this overarching theory: the first examines outbreaks on static graphs with randomly added edges at unpredictable intervals, while the second explores fully dynamic scenarios where connections toggle between active and inactive states without removing any original vertices. We provide asymptotic estimates for the final size of each model, demonstrating that the proportion of infected nodes stabilizes as a constant factor of a node's connections, with only a logarithmic adjustment. Additionally, we present numerical simulations to evaluate our theoretical findings. The theories of infectious diseases have been applied to various dynamic systems, particularly those involving periodic changes in graphs where edges are added and removed over time, as well as static graphs with edges removed automatically. Dynamic theories have also been employed to explore peer effects in networks, the topological evolution of networks, and the spread of epidemics. Prior studies have analyzed broad scenarios involving dynamic yet random graphs, as well as fully dynamic graphs. Our focus includes general models based on two types of graphs: dynamic graphs with randomly deleted edges and fully dynamic graphs allowing for both the addition and deletion of edges. We develop an outbreak model for general time-varying graphs, characterize the eventual size of the outbreak, and conduct asymptotic analyses for both the static graph and fully dynamic scenarios. In the static case with randomly deleted edges, we find that the final size of the outbreak is at most a logarithmic factor larger than the number of a node's connections, while in the fully dynamic model, the number of infected nodes approaches a constant factor related to the number of links, again adjusted by a logarithmic factor. Our findings indicate that the final extent of the outbreak remains a constant factor of the number of connections, which can be significantly impactful in real-world social networks where the majority of ties are casual, enabling a small number of close contacts to trigger substantial outbreaks. This investigation into general time-varying graphs offers valuable insights, as it elucidates how the frequency of visits to a node influences the ultimate extent of an outbreak.

In order to confirm that the detected wobble is indeed caused by the planet and not other causes such as noise, a confirmation method was developed by measuring the Doppler Shift of the emitted spectrum and thus detecting the motion of the planet around the central star. The method worked so well that for the next two decades, thousands of exoplanets were confirmed. However, in recent years a strange trend was noticed where the number of confirmed exoplanets was declining. Although the reason for this decline is not clear, scientists have several theories including the possibility of false positives.

To ensure that the detected wobble is truly due to the planet and not other factors, such as background noise, a confirmation procedure was established that involved monitoring the Doppler shift in the star's emitted spectrum, thereby tracking the planet's orbit around the star. This method proved highly effective, leading to the confirmation of thousands of exoplanets over the next two decades. Recently, however, a curious trend has emerged: the number of reported exoplanets appears to be decreasing. Though the cause of this decline remains uncertain, scientists have proposed several theories, including the possibility of false positives. In this paper, I will explore the issue of false positives, discuss their implications, and introduce a new numerical confirmation procedure designed to reduce their occurrence. Additionally, I will emphasize the need for further observations to determine whether the decline in confirmed exoplanets is genuine.",

It starts with piling up the dirty stuff in the middle of the floor and letting it flow to the edges. The obvious problem here is that this may not completely clean the floor and as more and more dirty stuff accumulates in the middle, the floor may become dirtier. This article develops an alternative method which is to start with spraying some cleaner around the floor and let it spread around by gravitational force. The article then develops a probabilistic framework to analyze this method. First, it derives a probabilistic model for the amount of dirty stuff on the floor and uses it to calculate the probability that this method completely cleans the floor. Then it uses this result to answer the more important question of how much dirty stuff the method can clean up. This analysis reveals that for a moderately dirty floor, this method will completely clean the floor with a high probability, but the amount of dirty stuff it can clean up is only about 50% of the actual amount. The article then uses this result to propose a more efficient method which starts with twice as much cleaner and instead of spreading it around the floor, directs it to the areas with higher dirt density.

This process involves gathering the dirt into a pile in the center of the floor and allowing it to flow outward toward the edges. However, a primary drawback of this method is that it may not effectively clean the entire floor; as more dirt accumulates in the center, the floor can become increasingly grimy. This article introduces an alternative approach that involves spraying cleaner around the floor and letting it disperse due to gravitational forces. The discussion then employs a probabilistic framework to analyze this process. Initially, it establishes a probabilistic model for the amount of dirt present on the floor and uses this model to assess the likelihood of completely cleaning the floor. The analysis also addresses the critical question of how much dirt the method can effectively remove. Findings indicate that while this method has a high probability of thoroughly cleaning a moderately dirty floor, it only manages to eliminate about 50% of the actual dirt present. The article then suggests a more effective strategy that starts with double the amount of cleaner, concentrating it on areas with higher dirt accumulation rather than dispersing it across the entire floor.

Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe.

Despite this progress, understanding the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest challenges in cosmology and electron physics. The leading theory for dark matter suggests the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that could interact via the weak force, producing signals detectable by conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations from missions like Planck and the Dark Energy Survey have constrained the maximum potential interactions of WIMPs to near the scale of strong force interactions, which is significantly smaller than the scattering cross-section for neutrinos, leading to the exclusion of WIMPs as dark matter candidates. Neutrino oscillations effectively explain the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, presenting an intriguing alternative to dark matter. If neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, the gravitational potential within clusters of stars could trap a measurable quantity of electron neutrinos, potentially addressing the dark matter dilemma. This process resembles how a lightbulb emits light when an electric current flows through it: the star cluster serves as a massive light source, and the emitted neutrino light generates the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its strong collision cross-section, we propose that the known neutrino burst may result from electron neutrinos scattering off dark matter particles, accounting for approximately 30% of the universe's total dark matter density. We discuss a method to determine or refute the existence of this weakly interacting massive object dark matter by analyzing the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our universe.",

Such random graphs are commonly generated using one of two paradigms: the configuration model, which assumes a uniform probability distribution for all edge establishment, and the community model, which allows for the generation of arbitrary networks with pre-specified properties. However, different real-world networks may exhibit very different distributions of topological characteristics. Therefore, it is of interest to consider how the distributions of these characteristics may vary across different random graph models. Here we focus on two such characteristics, the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph, both of which have well-understood algorithmic techniques that allow for their exact determination for arbitrary random graphs. By employing a variety of random graph models, we find that the size of the largest planar matching exhibits a power-law distribution for every model considered, while the largest planar subgraph exhibits a power-law distribution in some models and exhibits a different, more exponential-like, distribution in others. Notably, we find that the power-law exponents for the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph are closely correlated with the exponent associated with the degree distribution of the graph. This suggests that the tail behavior of the distribution of these characteristics is most strongly influenced by the presence or absence of a wide variety of high-degree vertices within the random graph model.",

These random graphs are typically generated through two main approaches: the configuration model, which assumes a uniform probability for edge formation, and the neighborhood model, which permits the creation of various networks with specified characteristics. However, it is common for different real-time systems to exhibit varying distributions of topological features. This raises the question of how these distributions may differ among various random graph models. In this study, we concentrate on two specific properties: the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph. Both of these properties have well-established algorithmic methods that allow for precise determination in arbitrary random graphs. Our analysis using multiple random graph models reveals that the size of the largest planar matching follows a power-law distribution across all models considered. In contrast, the size of the largest planar subgraph exhibits a power-law distribution in some cases, while in others it shows a distinctly more exponential-like distribution. Importantly, we discover that the power-law exponents associated with the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph are closely related to the exponent of the graph's degree distribution.

The NIR flux density was relatively stable during this period, with no strong variations. Around May 20-25 2005 we detected a sharp rise in both the optical and NIR flux, reaching a peak in June 2005. The optical spectral index rapidly hardened in this period, possibly reaching a value of α=3.2. We hypothesize that this sudden brightening in PKS 2155-304 was caused by a rapid enhancement in the external radiation field density (as a result of the eruptinging Galaxy M33) shining through the relativistic jet of PKS 2155-304.

Important results in the present theory of turbulence were published by American mathematician Robert H . Luther in 1941 and Norwegian - American mathematician Bryce L . Dysthe in 1958 .",

It results from random collisions between molecules or particles, leading to a chaotic distribution of motion. The study of turbulence began in the 1920s with Norwegian engineer Károly (Karsten) Gustaf Arctander, who eventually established a university and a public library in Hungary that bear his name, specifically focused on footballers. Early theories of turbulence employed mathematical frameworks to define its characteristics, utilizing fundamental concepts such as differentiation, separation, and various integral equations. In the 1930s, advancements in research techniques and theoretical progress resulted in a consolidated new theory of turbulence. Notable contributions to the current understanding of turbulence were made by American mathematician Robert H. Luther in 1941 and Norwegian-American mathematician Bryce L. Dysthe in 1958.",

It exhibits remarkable features, such as fluctuations in color charge and net baryon density, which are theoretically measurable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Although many properties of QGP were established during the LHC's first run, the recent discovery of photon radiation from the QGP, reported by the ALICE collaboration, remains a significant enigma. In our study, we utilize the kinetic theory of thermal and angular velocity transfer to demonstrate that the QGP can emit simulated photons whose intensity is determined solely by the plasma's temperature and characteristics, without needing dynamic measurements within the standard model of particle physics. The virtuality of these emitted photons—defined as the square of the velocity scale at which the induced propagator falls to zero—is influenced by temperature. Thus, these photons could manifest the power and virtuality necessary to elucidate the ALICE anomaly. This proposed mechanism is not bound by Lorentz invariance, allowing it to function in any QGP-like system that exhibits substantial momentum scales and complex thermodynamics. To explore this process, we leverage the distinctive and robust thermodynamic properties of QGP to estimate photon radiation from highly coupled plasma and compare these estimates with data from lattice QCD. Our findings indicate that the anticipated levels of photon emission are sufficient to address the ALICE anomaly, should it persist following the completion of the LHC's second run. The ALICE collaboration recently reported photon radiation originating from the QGP during lead-lead collisions at the CERN LHC, marking a significant finding that had remained elusive for over three decades. While most expected QGP signatures were identified in the LHC's initial run, the detection of photon radiation, with an energy of about 9 GeV and an estimated emission rate of 10^10 GeV^-1 s^-1, has not yet been fully understood. Emission of real photons is governed by quantum electrodynamics (QED), while the emission of virtual photons is not limited by the symmetries of standard particle physics and can occur through a variety of processes. This research demonstrates that the QGP is capable of emitting virtual photons at an intensity dictated only by its temperature and plasma properties, thereby eliminating the need for dynamic measurements as per conventional particle physics. The virtuality associated with these emitted photons is temperature-dependent, allowing them to possess the characteristics necessary to potentially clarify the ALICE anomaly.",

Our empirical findings demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing approximate matching algorithms and achieves high-quality matches for datasets characterized by high-dimensional points.

At all redshifts the LFs are relatively similar, suggesting that the bolometric corrections are almost constant at these redshifts.

Additionally, we explore potential applications of our theory in quantum thermodynamics, predicting when a quantum system will respond similarly to both positive and negative measurement results, and we develop quantum algorithms that do not rely on explicit wavefunction evolution.",

        "rewrite_text": "The high-energy emission from GRO J1655-40, as revealed by INTEGRAL spectroscopy during the 2005 outburst, is noteworthy. This well-known black hole X-ray binary consists of a neutron star orbiting a black hole with a mass of 18 solar masses at a close distance of 13 to 31 radii of the star, completing an orbit every 2.87 hours. It is hypothesized that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as indicated by its classification as a Z-source, which is typified by strong, often normal, high-speed winds from the neutron star. These winds likely arise from the transfer of energy from the accretion disk to the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was first detected by INTEGRAL on January 28, 2005, peaking on February 24. This study emphasizes the high-energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 during this period. A key finding of this research is the identification of a cutoff power-law structure in the high-energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, accounting for nearly 50% of the flux across almost three orders of magnitude in energy. This characteristic is not commonly seen in X-ray binaries, and its discovery with INTEGRAL presents a new perspective on high-energy processes in these systems. The cutoff power-law portion is believed to extend from the accretion disk's blackbody component, often observed in black hole X-ray binaries, typically interpreted as the signature of gamma rays emitted from the disk's innermost region. The identification of a cutoff power-law in this system, with a neutron star at its center, suggests a novel understanding of high-energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, indicating that disk accretion may not be the sole mechanism for high-energy emission in these systems. This component could represent a new form of high-energy generation unique to this system, potentially linked to the strong winds from the neutron star.

These QHS equations of state begin with a reformulation of the many-body Hamiltonian in second quantization using creation and annihilation operators that adhere to standard commutation relations. Subsequently, the many-body Hamiltonian is modified to treat the atomic quantum many-body scheme as an analogous system of non-interacting molecules (the mean-field system), which can be explored using conventional many-body physics techniques. This results in a fresh category of equations of state for nuclear materials. The Hamiltonian for the equivalent mean-field system is parameterized using an effective interaction power and a chemical potential, with the effective interaction power represented by the second virial constant of the original many-body Hamiltonian. This parameterization facilitates the fitting of the anticipated EOS to both nuclear many-body physics outcomes and the ground state properties of reactor matter. A thorough analysis of the proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter reveals substantial enhancements in analytical results compared to both the standard Quantum Ideal Gas EOS and the prior neutron matter EOS.

For more general gauge theories, in particular for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at large nucleon momentum transfers, the color confinement is better described by quark-antiquark bound states, or mesons, rather than freely moving colored fermions. In particular, a fundamental quantity in the QCD calculation of the hadronic spectrum is the Wilson loop, which, in the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop $C$ in space-time. The fundamental representation of the gauge group is usually chosen. The dependence of the Wilson loop on the loop dynamics is more complicated.

Recently, by using the supergravity in eleven dimensions, a string theory realization of a long Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ group is proposed. The corresponding string configuration is the graviton with one temporal and one spatial infinite size. This allows a detailed comparison between the field theory and gravity results. For finite-size loops, new Quantum Mechanics-like phenomena may arise. For example, it may admit discrete energy levels with a spectrum linearly proportional to the area of the loop. In this article, we present a more general class of string configurations, which are the finite-size gravitons corresponding to loops with arbitrary shapes.

In the context of advanced gauge physics, particularly in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under conditions of large nucleon velocity transfers, color confinement is more effectively described by the bound states of quarks and antiquarks—known as mesons—rather than by independently moving colored fermions. A key quantity in the QCD analysis of the hadronic scale is the Wilson loop, which, within the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop \\( C \\) in space-time, typically in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. The relationship between the dynamics of the loop and the Wilson loop itself becomes increasingly complex; specifically, the area law for large loops does not hold. Instead, for small loops, the area law is adjusted to be proportional to the perimeter of the loop \\( C \\), a phenomenon referred to as the perimeter law. The connection between area and perimeter laws has been recognized for over 40 years. Recently, a string theory interpretation of a long Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the \\( SU(N_c) \\) group was proposed using eleven-dimensional supergravity. In this model, the corresponding string configuration is represented by a graviton that has one spatial dimension of infinite size. This setup allows for a detailed analogy between field theory and gravitational results. For finite-length loops, new quantum mechanics-like phenomena may emerge, such as the possibility of discrete energy levels that are linearly proportional to the area of the loop. In this discussion, we introduce a broader family of string configurations, specifically finite-length gravitons analogous to strings with defined shapes, utilizing the second fundamental representation of \\( SU(N_c) \\) to characterize the loops. The relevant gravitational background is a truncation of type IIB supergravity on \\( S^5 \\times T^{11} \\). The quantum mechanics-like spectrum associated with such backgrounds has been previously studied. Notably, different classical configurations of the loop exhibit distinct behaviors in terms of particle mechanics-like states.

The bright infrared nuclear starburst in NGC4418, shining as a dominant contributor of infrared luminosity in the Antennae system, has been known for many years (Braine et al. 1993, Downes & Solomon 1998).

We detect high velocity outflowing motions in this region, of up to 400 km/s. This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).

The prominent infrared nuclear starburst in NGC 4418 has long been recognized as a major source of infrared luminosity within the Antennae system (Braine et al. 1993; Downes & Solomon 1998). Despite its recognition, the origins of this starburst and its relationship with the underlying AGN remained enigmatic.

This contrasts sharply with the expected gravitational collapse speed for this region, estimated at only 50-100 km/s. The fast outflows are likely the result of interactions between the molecular gas and a potentially undetected counter-spinning molecular gas component, as previously discussed in relation to similar phenomena in the Milky Way (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017). Our findings align with recent results from Fu et al. (2019), who identified a radio-loud Seyfert 1 nucleus with ongoing star formation in NGC 4418.

This absorption feature is absent in the VLT/ISAAC spectra. We model the NIRSPEC data as a simple shell of gas and dust surrounding the star, demonstrating that this configuration can account for the observed Brγ emission and excess near-infrared flux. We discuss the formation and implications of the gas and dust in relation to the conditions surrounding the donor star.",

The most massive stars, with a likely initial mass of several hundred solar masses, have an implied present formation mass of several thousand solar masses if they have starved-looking disks and are considered to be in the main sequence phase. The derived mass and size are also consistent with stellar-mass-threshold predictions for formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), an expected signature of active supermassive black hole growth at the center of the cluster. The age and masses of the stellar populations are also consistent with IMBH formation via seeds from the remnants of very massive stars, although higher chance of coalescence for lower mass seeds cannot be ruled out. A peculiar velocity of the cluster with respect to the local standard of rest, measured from the motion of bright member stars, and the mass projected along the line-of-sight, both suggest the cluster may not be virialized.

Observations using various optical and far-infrared telescopes have uncovered an excess of Yellow-Green (YG) stars compared to the surrounding diffuse population. This distribution approximates a circular Gaussian shape, with a projected diameter of 1.6 x 1.3 kpc (2.2 x 1.7 Mpc), which constitutes 0.14% of the Orion Arm's radius. The presence of this overdensity is largely supported by weak optical emissions from dust detected by the *Spitzer Space Telescope,* as well as infrared spectroscopic studies indicating a high density of young, massive galaxies.

The estimated mass and size align with stellar-mass threshold predictions for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are expected to signal the active growth of supermassive black holes at the cluster's center.

In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure. The properties of haloes in clusters are largely set by their major mergers since z &gt; 2, leaving them with short orbital times and low orbital kinetic energy. Conversely, the evolution of void haloes is more complex, with a mixture of processes at work. Subhaloes can only survive in the highest density regions for a limited time, while the expansion of the universe disperses material, resulting in lower concentrations and lower orbital energies.

These advancements have yielded new insights into halo assembly processes, allowing for detailed study of substructure formation within individual halos and the influence of environmental factors on halo properties. While the evolution of the halo mass function generally aligns with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, significant deviations occur only at the extreme high and low mass ends. In contrast, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviors, showing considerable variance across different simulations and varying with time and environmental context. \n\nIn this study, we leverage the large-volume (greater than 8.5 billion g^{-1} Mpc^{3}), intermediate-resolution (electron mass < 8.5 x 10^{9} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of PDFs related to the density, spin, and orbital kinetic power of luminous matter halos across four different environments: clusters, sheets, filaments, and voids. We also examine how processes of subhalo accretion, disruptions, and mergers affect these structures. The mass distribution of these halos evolves significantly over time, and environmental context plays a crucial role in shaping the distributions at any given time. Generally, halos in sheets and filaments exhibit more concentrated mass distributions compared to those in clouds or voids at all epochs. Such changes are evident in their corresponding mass functions, with filament clusters emerging as the most massive and dynamically evolved structures, while voids represent the most overdense regions in the universe, indicating sites of recent and future structure formation. The temporal and environmental evolution of these distributions is thus linked to the hierarchical growth of structure.\n\nThe spin and orbital kinetic power also display significant differences among environments. The spin magnitude shows nearly universal evolution, independent of environment or redshift, whereas the orbital kinetic power exhibits varying behaviors, with its distribution shifting toward lower values in more evolved environments. This aligns with the hierarchical formation of structure in sheets and filaments, which predominantly occurs at later times, resulting in a concentration of material in primary regions and a reduction in substructure. The properties of halos in clusters are largely determined by major mergers that occur since z > 2, resulting in tighter orbital times and lower orbital kinetic power. In contrast, the evolution of void halos is more intricate, influenced by a mix of processes. Subhalos can only remain in high-density areas for short durations, while the universe's expansion disperses material, leading to lower concentrations and less orbital energy. Nonetheless, voids appear significantly later than those in clusters and sheets, characterized by fewer major mergers and a greater number of minor interactions.",

This star is located in the constellation Hercules at a distance of 20.7 light years from the Earth. The existence of 14 Her planets make this system the seventh closest system to the Earth. Since the discovery of the planets around 14 Herculis was announced, several studies have been carried out in order to confirm their physical and orbital characteristics. 14 Her planets can be categorized into three groups according to their sizes. The planets in the inner group have semi-major axes between 0.13 and 0.36 astronomical units, the planets in the middle group have semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units, and the planets in the outer group have semi-major axes greater than 0.7 astronomical units. Planets in the inner and outer groups have minimal masses between 7 and 22 Earth masses, whereas the mass of the planets in the middle group is between 22 and 55 Earth masses.

We show that, because of their relatively short periods and the proximity of the outermost planet in the system to their star, the 14 Her planets might have formed in multiple blocks and were unable to move further away from the star due to planet-planet scattering. Moreover, we predict the existence of a fourth outer planet in the system with a minimal mass of 9 Earth masses. However, further precise radial velocity measurements are required in order to confirm the existence of this planet and to characterize its orbit.

This star, located in the constellation Hercules, lies approximately 20.7 light-years from Earth, making the 14 Her system the seventh closest star system to our planet. Following the announcement of these planetary discoveries, several surveys have been conducted to validate their physical and orbital properties. The planets around 14 Herculis can be classified into three groups based on their sizes: the inner group, with semi-major axes ranging from 0.13 to 0.36 astronomical units; the middle group, with semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units; and the outer group, characterized by semi-major axes exceeding 0.7 astronomical units. The inner and outer group planets possess minimum masses ranging from 7 to 22 Earth masses, while the middle group has planetary masses between 22 and 55 Earth masses. In this study, we conducted numerical simulations to analyze the dynamic evolution of the 14 Her planets. Our findings suggest that, given their closely spaced orbits and the proximity of the outermost planet to their star, the planets may have formed in distinct groups and were unable to migrate farther from the star due to moon-planet interactions. Additionally, we propose the existence of a fourth outer planet with a modest mass of 9 Earth masses; however, further precise measurements of radial velocity are necessary to confirm this planet's existence and define its orbit.

The analysis reveals that the evidence cited in recent studies suggesting universal acceleration is, in fact, consistent with an open universe model and does not require exotic forms of luminous matter. The paper contends that the proof of the universe's acceleration is inconclusive and may reflect an evidence selection bias. The discovery of the universe's rate of expansion is one of the major achievements in modern cosmology, reported by two independent research teams in 2014 and 2016, leading to significant media attention. This finding was rapidly embraced as fact within the astronomy community, with the prevailing theory attributing the acceleration to a form of dark energy characterized by an equation of state factor of w < -1. However, the conceptual foundations of this assertion have been rigorously scrutinized and found wanting. It has been established that a range of theoretically sound black mass models supports a nearly zero estimate of w compatible with the observed supernova data. The empirical methods used to dismiss non-dark energy theories with low w values are shown to have substantial flaws, rendering them invalid. Recent studies corroborate similar findings, indicating that Type Ia supernova data align with the initial research claim attributing acceleration to dark energy, yet contradict the more recent assertions that the universe is either closed or flat. Consequently, the reported acceleration is likely attributable to selection bias or incorrect statistical analysis. As research in this area is still in its early stages, the true nature of cosmic acceleration may become clearer as new observational datasets are collected and further simulations of dark energy are performed. Until then, skepticism regarding the universe's acceleration is warranted.",

By employing entangled quantum signals, repeaters can extend entanglement over vast distances. Given the exponential decay of entanglement with distance, effective long-distance quantum communication necessitates repeaters that can preserve and extend entanglement over these ranges. Current methods often use individual systems optimized for specific distance ranges. For instance, short-distance systems, like quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through techniques such as detecting quantum side channels or modifying qubits during transmission. Conversely, long-distance solutions, such as quantum memories, rely on the purification of largely entangled quantum states to achieve high entanglement rates. Both types of systems often require localized adaptations in transmission mechanisms, limiting the distances over which entanglement can be effectively distributed.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a quantum repeater architecture that merges advantageous elements from both short-distance and long-distance optimized models, aimed at enabling long-distance entanglement flow within urban networks. Our approach utilizes parallelization to effectively manage the communication overhead associated with entanglement generation and quantum memory usage, employing low-dimensional entanglement between dark and matter qubits to achieve significant entanglement production with reduced quantum resource consumption.

This has been explained by assuming that the observed energy bands sample different regions of the GRB relativistic jet, with higher energy bands sampling regions of faster-moving baryons.

This phenomenon has been attributed to the fact that different energy bands probe various regions of the GRB’s relativistic jet, with higher energy bands examining areas where baryons change at a slower rate.

Our analysis reveals that the observed break time in the correlation arises from the competition between the variability time scales of the burst's powering engine and the resolution time scales of the detectors. Although the exact origin of this variability time scale is not definitively known, it is likely linked to internal gravity currents within the plasma outflow that occurs during jet acceleration.

These stellar processes have never before been observed in such primordial stars, and their consequences for the early universe are discussed.

For example, the late stages of a logarithmic distribution may be similar in appearance to a power law14, and it has been suggested that the size distribution of computer files may be consistent with a power law, even though this is often attributed to finite size effects15. Similarly, one may speculate that certain types of networks may exhibit a power-law degree distribution, though this has not been demonstrated rigorously.

Furthermore, it has also been suggested that power-law functions might result from the superposition of many more conventional distributions, the simple permutation of a single distribution, or a logarithmic distribution. Indeed, numerous processes can give rise to such distributions. For example, combining a large number of common distributions can produce a distribution with a power-law tail. Additionally, heavy-tailed functions that exhibit similar mathematical characteristics as power laws can be seen in various contexts, originating from different generative mechanisms. For instance, the tail end of a logarithmic distribution can visually resemble a power law, and it has been proposed that the length distribution of machine files might align with a power law, despite often being linked to finite width effects. One might also hypothesize that certain types of networks could show a power-law degree distribution, although this remains unproven. Moreover, some processes that yield power-law distributions are not strictly generative. For example, removing vertices from a network with a power-law degree distribution may result in the loss of nodes that exhibit a similar degree distribution. It is further suggested that heavy-tailed functions may emerge from the summation of a limited number of common distributions. A truncated power law, for instance, could stem from the superposition of regular distributions.

There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy. The results of long-term observations of the dust content in a number of galaxies, made using the 100-m and the 45-m radio telescopes of the MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and the 0.7-meter telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the APEX Telescope, the IRAM 30-m and the SEST 20-m radio telescopes in Chile, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, and other facilities have shown that the production and evolution of dust in a galaxy is associated with certain properties of this galaxy. It was established that in late-type spiral galaxies the intensity of radiation in radio wavelengths increases with time, which indicates the gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium, due to the merger of large bodies. In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies. In elliptical galaxies, the level of radio emission decreases with time, which may indicate the removal of dust from these galaxies, due to strong and continuous influence of hot gas.",

        "rewrite_text": "Interstellar dust is a trace component found within galaxies, primarily concentrated in dusty regions like spiral arms and nuclei. There are two opposing viewpoints regarding the origin of interstellar dust. One perspective suggests that dust forms within stellar atmospheres and is expelled through stellar winds, supernovae, or planetary nebulae. Conversely, the other viewpoint posits that dust is continuously generated in areas undergoing recent star formation. To bridge this debate, a third model has been proposed, indicating that dust forms in the intergalactic medium and is subsequently transported into galaxies through collisions involving large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf stars. This theory accounts for the observed correlation between interstellar dust abundance and galaxy formation. The presence of dust significantly influences the development and characteristics of new generations of stars and galaxies. Composed of tiny particles typically measuring just a few hundred nanometers in length, interstellar dust is best studied through optical observations in the visual and infrared wavelengths. Long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio spectrum serves as an effective method to investigate this matter. The evolution of spectral indices associated with radio radiation intensity is highly dependent on the distribution of dust within galaxies. Analyzing variations in the spectral index over extended periods, such as several decades, allows for predictions regarding the extent and distribution of interstellar dust within a galaxy. Comprehensive observations of dust content across various stars, conducted with facilities including the 100-meter and 45-meter radio telescopes at MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and 0.7-meter telescopes of Russia's Special Astrophysical Observatory, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, APEX Telescope, IRAM 30-meter and SEST 20-meter radio telescopes in Chile, as well as the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, have revealed that the production and evolution of dust are closely linked to specific characteristics of the galaxies studied. Findings indicate that in late-type spiral galaxies, radio wavelength emissions increase over time, suggesting a gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium due to the merging of large bodies. In contrast, early-type spiral nuclei display little change in radiation frequency, indicating minimal dust production. Moreover, in elliptical galaxies, a decline in radio emissions over time may reflect the loss of dust, likely driven by the intense and sustained effects of harsh gas.",

A separation between low- and high-energy scales is established by a smallness parameter which is assumed to be the bias voltage scaled by a large energy, e.g., the plunger energy. Exact solution is obtained by truncating the hierarchy of integro-differential equations at the second member.

In this formulation, the conductance is expressed in terms of a closed set of differential equations. Our solution method enables exploration of a wide range of process components.

Additionally, we identify a cutoff energy and cutoff scale that differentiate between slow (i.e., dependent on the system’s parameters) and fast (i.e., independent) scales in the system. The effective theory captures the former, while the latter is incorporated into the running (evolving) cutoff scale. This method provides a robust framework for investigating nonequilibrium quantum dot dynamics as the plunger (orbital) count and gate current are varied. Notably, this allows for the identification of parameter regimes where certain nonequilibrium steady states were not attained during the system's evolution from earlier conditions.

In particular, the weak force is mediated by the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs boson, yet the interactions of these particles are described by a single coupling constant, coupling the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces together. The renormalization group (RG) has told us that this single coupling constant must evolve from a high energy value ofunity at high energy scales. By introducing an additional symmetry between the strong and electroweak forces, and a singlet scalar field under both, we can naturally give the coupling constant of the weak force a value less than that of the strong coupling constant, without the presence of any new particles. This symmetry breaking is achieved through the vev of the Higgs field, which is what gives the particles their masses. This scalar field, and the corresponding symmetry breaking, is called the Higgs mechanism. Because the Higgs has no particular charge, it can couple to both the weak bosons and the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism can suppress the unwanted interaction between the electron and the photon. This results in the cancellation of the tree-level Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) and the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixing.

Specifically, the weak force is mediated by the W and Z bosons, along with the Higgs boson; however, the interactions involving these particles can be described by a single coupling constant that unifies the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. Insights from the renormalization group (RG) suggest that this coupling constant could increase from a value of unity at high energy scales. By incorporating an additional symmetry between the strong and electroweak forces, along with a singlet scalar field that interacts with both sectors, we can effectively reduce the interaction function of the strong force below the strong coupling constant value, all without introducing new particles. This symmetry breaking is facilitated by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the Higgs field, which is responsible for imparting mass to the particles. This scalar field and the accompanying symmetry breaking process are referred to as the Higgs mechanism. Since the Higgs carries no specific charge, it can couple with both the weak bosons and the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, which helps mitigate undesired interactions between electrons and photons. Consequently, this leads to the cancellation of tree-level Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) and corresponds to the observed patterns of quark and lepton masses and mixing. By implementing a small explicit symmetry-breaking term, we can achieve a Higgs boson with suitably suppressed interactions with electrons and quarks, while still maintaining the effective unification of the electroweak and strong forces described earlier. This comprehensive framework must also account for the relevant outcomes in nuclear dynamics and scattering processes.

Simulations suggest that the development of NGC 3379 has the potential to transform a small mass satellite like Leo IV into a dim dwarf galaxy. This research highlights that even low-mass satellite galaxies within massive halos can undergo significant changes due to interactions with their host galaxies. Notably, a diffuse cloud of neutral hydrogen has been detected surrounding Leo IV, which supports the idea of transformation in these lesser mass systems. Leo IV was first identified in 2015 through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and its evolutionary trajectory is marked by its past higher star formation rate and eccentric orbit. The findings illustrate that small-mass satellite galaxies, such as Leo IV, can evolve into more substantial systems through their interactions with larger galaxies like NGC 3379.",

However, if the potential of the scalar field has a lower bound, the contribution of the fluctuations of this field to the gravitational waves is not effective. In this work, we study the maximal amount of gravitational waves generated in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effects of the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution. Thus, the fluctuation of the scalar field determining the number density of dark matter contributes to the gravitational waves with the parameter Omega_GW, which is related to the speed of the gravity. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. In addition, we study the perturbation of the gravitational wave during the sub-Hubble scales. We find that the perturbation of the gravitational wave is dependent on the effective speed of gravity during inflation. If the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then the amplitude of the perturbation of the gravitational wave is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed of gravity. This result has an upper limit, which is 1/3 for the case of two-field models and 1/7 for the case of multi-field models. Finally, we discuss the gravitational wave background from the inflationary universe. If the effective speed of gravity is larger than the light speed, there are many modes with the scale of the Hubble radius at the time of inflation, which lead to a large gravitational wave background. In this case, it is difficult to explain the recent gravitational wave experiments such as B-mode experiment and LIGO/Virgo. However, if the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then we obtain the consistent gravitational wave background with the current value.

        "rewrite_text": "In the curvaton scenario, fluctuations in the scalar field that govern the dark matter number density also contribute to gravitational waves, as indicated by the parameter Ω_GW, which reflects the speed of gravity during the inflationary period. However, if the scalar field's potential has a lower bound, these fluctuations have a negligible impact on gravitational waves. In this study, we investigate the maximum gravitational wave generation within the curvaton framework, taking into account the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the peak gravitational wave output in this scenario aligns with the predictions of general relativity, where Ω_GW = 1. This conclusion remains valid even if the scalar field potential has an upper limit.\n\nOur research focuses on a scenario involving two scalar fields: a real inflaton field and a complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field dictates the fluctuations in dark matter density, whereas the real inflaton field influences the universe's expansion rate. During inflaton oscillations, gravity's effective speed approaches the speed of light, but during the evolution of the complex inflaton field, it slows down. As a result, the fluctuations in the scalar field that determine dark matter density lead to gravitational waves characterized by the parameter Ω_GW, linked to gravity's speed.\n\nAdditionally, we analyze perturbations of gravitational waves at sub-Hubble scales, revealing that these perturbations are contingent upon the effective speed of gravity throughout inflation. If this speed matches that of light, the frequency of gravitational wave perturbations is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed of gravity, resulting in a maximum limit of 1/3 for two-field models and 1/7 for multi-field models.\n\nFinally, we discuss the gravitational wave background produced by the inflationary universe. If the effective speed of gravity exceeds the speed of light, various modes at the scale of the Hubble radius during inflation generate a substantial gravitational wave background, complicating the explanation of recent gravitational wave observations such as B-mode experiments and LIGO/Virgo findings. In contrast, when the effective speed of gravity equals the speed of light, we achieve a gravitational wave background that is consistent with current observations. By integrating a scalar field potential with a lower bound, we can portray a framework capable of achieving maximal gravitational wave production, clarifying the observed gravitational wave background while considering the fluctuations of the scalar field.",

In this paper, we report an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice (specifically the Ti4+ sites), the crystal structure evolves to anatase type and acquires a net magnetic moment, which is found to be persistent above room temperature. This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem. In the supplementary material, authors have provided more experimental data and also some hints for the theoretical explanation of TDIM. First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic. Various mechanisms for the persistence of this net moment are explored. While substantial ionic coupling in Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is required to explain the observed moment value. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature of this moment is consistent with experimental results. Our work demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism to induce ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials.

TiO2, commonly used as a semiconductor, is generally considered non-magnetic. However, recent studies have demonstrated the presence of ferromagnetism in various TiO2 forms. Since ferromagnetism has been observed in several Ti4+-disordered materials, exploring its origins in TiO2 is both theoretically and practically significant. This research delves into the mechanisms of Ti4+-disorder induced ferromagnetism (TDIM) in TiO2 anatase. To investigate the TDIM mechanism, we synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with a diverse size distribution through a sol-gel method, employing three different synthesis techniques to manipulate the degree of Ti4+ disorder.",

They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces. We conclude that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may have an important impact on astrophysical jets, which makes it an important area for future study. The resonant coupling discussed here could also be important in microquasars, the envirnment of black hole systems like SS 433, where a pair of stars orbiting each other eject high-energy jets. The stars are in nearly circular orbits, but the jets are highly relativistic and tend to ejection in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. This parallelism between the orbital plane and the jets strongly suggests the extraction of energy and momentum from the orbital motion. The extraction of energy and momentum from a shearing relativistic flow may provide a new mechanism for this parallelism. Resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetos",

        "rewrite_text": "Astrophysical jets are powerful, collimated outflows originating from compact objects such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. They play a crucial role in how nuclei and clusters obtain much of their energy and momentum. While the exact mechanisms behind the formation of astrophysical jets remain uncertain, various theoretical models have been suggested, particularly emphasizing the role of magnetic fields in their generation, collimation, and sustenance. \n\nThis paper investigates the resonant interaction between fast Kelvin-Helmholtz waves and magnetosonic waves in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with a particular focus on the astrophysical environments where this interaction might occur. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems, the resonant mechanism can effectively transfer energy from the shear to the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz signal. For simplification, we consider a sheared plasma moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral medium subjected to an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction.\n\nWe examine the potential modes when the linear transmission frequency of the magnetosonic wave matches the phase velocity of the Kelvin-Helmholtz signal. The most unstable mode exhibits a low frequency in the y-direction and a non-zero phase velocity in the x and z directions. The growth rate of this most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the liquid vorticity in the y-direction, indicating that the instability is most pronounced in differentially rotating environments. However, this mode is also dependent on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, signifying that greater shear enhances the mode’s efficiency.\n\nMoreover, we assess the stability of this mode against non-linear influences. When the frequency of the magnetosonic wave equals that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode, the two waves interact non-linearly, resulting in the most unstable mode evolving into a steady blast wave with smooth transition regions. We propose that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves could significantly influence astrophysical jets, marking it as a vital area for future research. This resonant coupling may also have implications in microquasars, such as the white hole structure SS 433, where a binary star system ejects high-energy jets. Although the stars orbit in nearly circular paths, the jets are highly relativistic and emitted perpendicularly to the orbital plane. This alignment between the jets and the orbital plane suggests a mechanism for extracting power and momentum from the system’s orbital motion. The resonant enhancement of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic interactions may provide new insights into this parallelism.",

To remedy this limitation, several modifications to the WLC theory have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce an alternative concept known as the worm-like chain with breakable bonds (WLCBB). This model features multiple bending degrees of freedom and incorporates additional linear stiffness due to the breaking and reformation of bonds. We arrive at the exact solution by mapping the problem to a classical intersection problem in a plane. This theory is applied to investigate the mechanics of a small DNA fragment with two rigid obstacles at either end. Our findings indicate that this model can characterize DNA flexibility without needing to consider excluded volume effects. Furthermore, the theory suggests that as the thickness of the DNA fragment decreases, its flexibility initially increases until it reaches a critical point, after which it begins to decline. This paper serves as a revised and expanded version of prior work.",

This seemingly contradictory observation can be explained by considering water's structure as a network of hydrogen bonds. While the strength of an isolated bond can be calculated using fundamental principles, the hydrogen bonds in freshwater are significantly weakened due to their roles within this interconnected network. The implications of this phenomenon for water's behavior in biological systems, as well as in technical and technological contexts, are explored.

Typically, each hydrogen atom is shared between two molecules, with a bond length of approximately 0.98Å between the oxygen atoms involved. In classical terms, a hydrogen bond requires an attractive force between sharing atoms, which is applicable to the water molecules in this structure, as the forces between nitrogen and the shared oxygen atoms are noteworthy. However, the shared hydrogen atoms are not solitary; they are integrated into a network of such pairs, forming a three-dimensional lattice throughout the volume of the water. This lattice diminishes the strength of the hydrogen bonds among the various water molecules. The degree of this weakening is contingent upon the specific arrangement of molecules within the cluster. If we assume the crystal stretches uniformly across the entire cluster, the force between the shared hydrogen atoms is found to be one-fifth the strength of the force between the oxygen atoms of the water molecules. This reduction in hydrogen bond strength significantly influences the dynamics of water in various systems.",

One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contribution of the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino to this magnetic moment. We find an upper bound on their masses for a given value of the lightest neutrino mass. This model can be considered as an example of an unbalanced See-Saw mechanism, where the violation of the conservation of one or several of the additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very massive particles. This model has some other interesting phenomenological implications, in particular the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this model leads to the observed enhancement of the Higgs decay to a pair of muons, presented at the Moriond EW session as an excess. Massive and massless neutrinos were hypothesized in the 60s in order to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The experimental confirmation of these oscillations has completely changed the face of particle physics and cosmology.

This framework can be viewed as an unbalanced seesaw mechanism where the violation of one or more additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or exceptionally heavy particles. Furthermore, this theory has significant phenomenological implications, including the potential existence of keV sterile neutrinos. It also predicts an enhancement in the decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of muons, which was recently observed as an excess during the Moriond EW session. The notion of massive and massless neutrinos emerged in the 1960s to explain lunar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and empirical evidence of these oscillations has profoundly impacted particle physics and cosmology. The standard explanation for these oscillations involves the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, alongside the Dirac framework for neutrinos and the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) theory for photons and the Fermi theory for electrons. Collectively, these particles are known as Standard Model (SM) neutrinos, which are thought to have zero mass. However, oscillation experiments demonstrate that at least two of these neutrinos must possess non-zero mass. In contrast, cosmological observations regarding the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) suggest that at least two neutrinos must be precisely massless. Collectively, these observations encapsulate the challenges posed by the floppy masses problem.",

The states arising from this chiral symmetry breaking include pions, kaons, and eta mesons, with their interactions described by Chiral Perturbation Theory. Conversely, string theory, often referred to simply as strings, is a highly effective framework for understanding elementary particles and features an unbroken global symmetry known as scale or chiral symmetry.

Because this identity is local, the dimensions of the homogeneous parts of the Levi identity for a given length must correspond accordingly. In 1983, A. M.

While our data did show the characteristic double-humped structure in the lightcurve, indicative of a jet traversing the surrounding medium, it appeared only as a subtle deficit in the early stages of the afterglow lightcurve. We propose that this deeper deficit may result from an underestimation of the k-corrected host galaxy magnitude in previous analyses, suggesting that the actual lightcurve has a much smoother gradient.

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun in the Solar System.

        "rewrite_text": "In hierarchical multiplanet systems, the tidal forces exerted by distant galaxies can lead to a reduction in their orbital semi-major axes and potentially trigger type II catastrophic mergers. In cases with less massive outer planets, significant tides from far-off worlds can similarly lower orbital semi-major axes while also damping the planet's orbits. Our research demonstrates that if the innermost planet possesses a high non-zero eccentricity, tidal forces acting on it can induce eccentricity oscillations, pushing eccentricities beyond the dynamically determined upper limit, resulting in smaller orbits. We conduct N-body simulations to validate this theoretical framework and highlight the mechanism’s potential to contract non-resonant orbits in multiplanet systems. We propose that this process could effectively account for the relative positions of Earth and Mars within the solar system and might have facilitated the transfer of planetesimals toward Earth and Venus. The long-term dynamics of hierarchical multiplanet systems are heavily influenced by the orientations of the planets' orbits and spins. If their spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system may enter a Cassini state, where planetary eccentricities dampen but their orbital angular momenta remain correlated. Conversely, if the spin axes align with their orbital planes, a Kozai state may arise, leading to oscillatory forced eccentricities over a period that matches a complete cycle of node precession, during which the planets’ semi-major axes may shrink to induce type II or type I drift based on the characteristics of neighboring bodies. We propose that incorporating even a single test particle experiencing apsidal motion can significantly increase the number of completed Kozai cycles before the alignment of apsides. Planetary systems that reach the Kozai state followed by type II or type I drift could consequently experience greater changes in their semi-major axes than those observed in the Solar System. Our findings indicate that if one or more planets in such a system have notable non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can enhance eccentricities beyond the dynamically defined maximum, potentially leading to collisions. We utilize N-body simulations to support this analytical theory and suggest it may elucidate the positions of Earth and Mars in the Solar System.

Moreover, the enhancement’s evolution is closely tied to the low-energy cosmic ray spectrum profile. Our research underscores the significance of studying the early evolution of the Universe, particularly to understand low-energy processes like cosmic ray interactions in primordial gas. We develop a formalism for modeling the evolution of chemical abundances, emphasizing element abundance enhancement based on specific ionization and chemical networks, as well as a given cosmic ray spectrum. The calculations yield self-consistent results that can feedback into the ionization and chemical networks. To perform this, we outline the twelve critical reactions necessary for producing fourteen key molecules and a comprehensive network for eleven additional compounds (including B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po). The updated molecular composition can significantly influence gas warming/cooling rates, star formation, gravitational collapse, and further enrichment. The impacts described in this study extend beyond the epoch of reionization and are relevant throughout the gas's history until it is removed from the model by some feedback mechanism. Additionally, we provide Python notebooks (available on G...).",

An especially important process is the fluidization of granular materials, which has wide applications in the mining, metallurgical, chemical and food industries1,2,3,4,5,6. Particles in a fluidized granular layer are influenced by several fundamental factors, such as the total volume fraction, the shape and size of particles, the distribution of the particles in the fluidized bed, the energy input to the fluidized granular layer, etc. All these factors affect the fluidization characteristics of the granular layer.

Particles in a fluidized granular layer are influenced by many fundamental factors , such as the total volume fraction , the form and size of molecules , the distribution of the particles in the fluidized bed , the electricity input to the fluidized granular layer , etc .All these influences influence the fluidization properties of the granular layer .

        "rewrite_text": "A shallow granular layer subjected to vertical oscillation undergoes fluidization. During this process, the average grain density increases with depth, while the flux of grains passing through the inner boundary decreases, aligning with the Beverloo Law. Conversely, the flux of grains at the upper surface does not exhibit this inverse relationship; instead, it varies with depth. This observation suggests the existence of a tri-layer structure within the fluidized granular layer, characterized by a deeper bottom layer without fluidization, a middle layer that follows the Beverloo Law for fluidization, and an upper layer that behaves differently. This tri-layer configuration is similar to the dynamics of sandpiles in self-organized critical systems, with the notable exception that the bottom layer remains intact. \n\nIn this study, a horizontally oscillated deep granular layer (measuring 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) is fluidized by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of vertical vibrations. The total mass fraction of the particles is 0.58, and their diameters range from 5mm to 20mm. With a vibration amplitude of 0.15m, the frequency is varied from 20Hz to 80Hz, allowing for measurements of average grain motion at six different depths within the fluidized granular layer.

These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

        "rewrite_text": "The oldest known stars in the universe are blue stragglers (BS). These stars are believed to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently to allow for the main sequence life of their constituent stars. Consequently, BS stars are composed of iron cores and burn helium-3, having transformed nearly all of their original hydrogen and helium into helium-3. A key feature of these stars is their impressive size; over 90% have a greater mass than their counterparts in the local universe. This has been puzzling since recent theories on galaxy formation suggest that such massive stars are quite rare, with simulations typically yielding only about 5-10% heavy stars. However, new measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University's 2.3-meter telescope offer a potential resolution to this mystery. Utilizing data from the Keck telescopes, we have identified nine dark straggler stars among three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all exhibiting strong beryllium (Be) absorption in their spectra—a phenomenon absent in observations of regular galaxies and challenging to replicate in laboratory studies. The quantity of Be must be close to half-life values to produce this absorption, leading to the notion that typical freeze-out methods cannot generate the required levels of Be, while early-accreted s-process material is also excluded. Our findings propose a fresh perspective, suggesting that many BS stars may have arisen from accretion events involving material from a binary companion. Since beryllium is particularly effective at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, its presence in the spectra of BS stars likely indicates the mechanism of their formation. We propose that these accretion events could be highly enriched with light elements such as beryllium. These insights have significant implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts of beryllium can be synthesized in binary systems, these may represent crucial sites of nucleosynthesis in the early universe and provide a missing link between the populations of very low and very high-mass stars in the nascent galaxy community.",

Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",

        "rewrite_text": "Galaxy clusters have been pivotal in revealing important astrophysical constraints across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to X-ray. However, despite their contributions, the mechanisms behind the mass formation of these clusters remain a central question in contemporary astrophysics. While analytical theories regarding cluster formation (e.g., @rs82) have often been eclipsed by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04, @ds08), which have successfully replicated essential observables such as the cluster luminosity and heat functions, there exists a notable discrepancy. The largest clusters predicted by these simulations are less frequent than those observed in the actual universe (see @k07, @l06; also @s07 for a review). This issue, referred to as the \"cosmic discordance,\" has led to various proposed explanations, including emissions sampling (e.g., @w84, @k84), cannibalism (e.g., @gm02), and the role of massive cluster progenitors (e.g., @mm01). Although these astrophysical models have effectively increased our understanding of the overall mass within clusters, they have not addressed how individual clusters evolve in volume. Recently, we found that the mass function of globular complexes in nearby galaxies closely correlates with the cumulative galaxy light near those clusters. Contrary to previous explanations that suggested cluster density gradually increases over time due to mergers or environmental factors, we propose that if most large clusters instead formed from the dissolution of lower-mass systems, there should be a negative correlation between cluster mass and cluster light. Our findings support this dissolution scenario, indicating that dense clusters are rarer in the universe and more likely to dissolve. However, our earlier results were based on limited statistical samples. In this paper, we present a larger dataset of 22 clusters. We have comprehensively derived kinematic data and confirmed stellar evaporation in 10 of these clusters. We suggest that stellar evaporation is a plausible explanation for the dissolution of these clusters and provides a natural explanation for the mass-light relationship without invoking additional dynamical processes. Thus, we propose that stellar evaporation may represent a significant new mechanism influencing cluster mass, which could profoundly impact the overall mass distributions in cosmological simulations.",

The solution to this problem requires a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum with superpartner particles at accessible energies.

Additionally, we analyze the collider phenomenology of the model, advocating that the light Higgs region can be evaluated at contemporary hadron colliders. Our study will cover: 1. A brief introduction to the MSSM-HS model and the symmetry principles that the superpartners must abide by. 2. A description of the model's spectrum, particularly detailing the Goldstino, the supersymmetric partner of the photino, as well as the zino, which is the supersymmetric partner of the Z boson.",

A recently introduced variable, the partial filling factor (PFF), is used to quantify the statistical spread of these generated sequences. PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations. This corresponds to a strong spatial heterogeneity of the low-zero sequences and supports a growth mechanism of these sequences from a few deterministically produced seeds. For certain mixtures, it is found that rare event sequences happen with a non-vanishing frequency, which makes them of interest for cryptography.

Our findings reveal that the gluon polarization is uniformly distributed across the longitudinally polarized QGP and is robust, persisting even after scattering events where quark spins are anti-parallel.

Optimal information transmission occurs across the entire spectrum of coupling constants when the signal frequency is a white noise, characterized by a minimal mean. In contrast, the ideal noise has a non-zero mean, and its variance decreases to zero as the signal amplitude surpasses a certain threshold. These findings offer strong design principles for enhancing the communication potential of nonlinear dynamical systems through optimal message modulation. \n\nIntroduction: Stochastic resonance (SR) is a long-established framework for understanding information transmission in nonlinear dynamical systems, where a weak, random signal is amplified, and the noise-induced fluctuations in the signal exceed the signal's average amplitude. Over the past thirty years, this counterintuitive effect has been experimentally validated and theoretically supported across various nonlinear systems. More recent research has explored information transmission via suprathreshold SR, where the signal exceeds a specific threshold. Previous investigations indicated that the optimal signal structure for suprathreshold SR is white noise, which has a zero mean. In this study, we derive the ideal distributions for stimulus and noise in the context of suprathreshold SR, concentrating on the classic diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. In this setup, the signal corresponds to the neuronal model's spiking activity, while the noise accounts for background synaptic and neuronal disturbances. Differing from earlier research, we find that the optimal information-carrying signal possesses a non-zero mean and that the ideal noise’s variance diminishes as the signal amplitude exceeds a critical threshold. Notably, optimal information transmission performance is attainable across the entire range of coupling constants. These results provide tangible design recommendations for maximizing the signaling capacity of nonlinear dynamical systems through effective signal modulation.\n\nMaterials and Techniques: Our work investigates information transmission via suprathreshold SR using the classic diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, which illustrates the membrane current dynamics of a neuron based on FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics and involves two linearly independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) pathways. The Langevin coefficients governing the model are defined by the amplitudes of the OU processes and Gaussian white noise terms, with ε representing the interaction strength. The model exhibits bistability, possessing two stable steady states, { S*± } = { -1, 1 }, corresponding to the membrane potentials of the 'up' and 'down' states, with stable periods that are distinctly separated.",

The mechanics of the sort are rather deep and mysterious, and the parallelism seems to arise from the interaction between dualheaps and cachelines. The algorithm seems to work well on modern multicore architectures, but it is not obvious how it should be adapted to work on shared-memory systems such as GPUs. Interestingly, dualheap selection is related to a stack-based sorting algorithm known as quick stack. The two algorithms share a number of similarities in their implementation and motivation. In fact, dualheap selection is faster than quick sort on some random distributions, suggesting that the unusual algorithm is more than just a trick. Dualheap selection and the quick stack were discovered independently around 2008 by separate computer scientists pursuing apparently unrelated research interests. There has been some speculation that dualheap selection may be a complex building block in some kind of a data structures continuum, similar to heaps, tries and chmaps. Dualheap selection has so far resisted all attempts at rigorous analysis, although it appears to have useful approximation properties and can be made stable with some tuning. No serious algorithm has been devised yet based on dualheap selection, although certain theoretical improvements and empirical successes have been demonstrated. Despite its success on real computer systems, dualheap selection has not been proven to be correct. In particular, it is not known whether the theory has all the right properties or whether there are exotic inputs that lead to incorrect behaviour. This article provides an overview of dualheap selection, with an eye toward explaining how and why it works.

        "rewrite_text": "Recently, a novel parallel sorting algorithm known as dualheap selection has emerged, demonstrating faster performance than Quicksort on both real and simulated computer systems. This algorithm functions by placing selected elements into highly balanced dualheaps, which seem to enhance the sorting process. Dualheaps are structured internally as heaps where the least-recently swapped item is positioned at the top. The underlying principles of the sorting mechanism are complex and somewhat enigmatic, with its parallelism arising from the interaction between dualheaps and cache lines. While dualheap selection shows promise on modern multicore architectures, its adaptation for shared-memory environments like GPUs remains unclear. Interestingly, it is linked to a stack-based sorting approach known as quick stack, and both strategies exhibit similarities in their implementation and underlying concepts. In fact, dualheap selection outperforms rapid sort on certain random distributions, indicating that this unconventional algorithm offers more than just a clever solution. Both dualheap selection and quick stack were independently discovered around 2008 by researchers from different academic fields. There are suggestions that dualheap selection could serve as a complex building block in a continuum of data structures similar to heaps, tries, and chmaps. Thus far, it has resisted thorough analytical efforts, but it appears to possess useful approximation characteristics and can be optimized with some adjustments. Although no comprehensive algorithm has been developed based on dualheap selection, there have been various empirical and theoretical advancements. Despite its success on real computing devices, the correctness of dualheap selection has yet to be established. Specifically, it remains uncertain whether the principle encompasses all necessary features or if there exist unusual input cases that could generate incorrect results. This document provides an overview of dualheap selection, focusing on its operational principles and rationale, while also highlighting recent developments in understanding the method and potential adaptations for various computing systems.",

We demonstrate that the forward-backward asymmetry in the decays of the B mesons to X s and c quarks, with X denoting a charged lepton or a neutrino, is particularly sensitive to the effects of the flavor changing current.

We further show that combining these constraints with measurements of CP violation in B meson mixing, in addition to allowing for a more precise determination of the SUSY parameters, will yield crucial information on the structure of the flavor changing current and hence help us understand the mechanism of flavor violation.

We find that, for a wide range of physically plausible parameters, these fields exist as stable configurations, rather than being plagued by magnetic instability. We also find that such fields modify the structure of neutron stars, and have impacts on their cooling behavior. Our results provide new insights into the nature of some magnetars, as well as offering new mechanisms for radio emission from these objects. Neutron stars are among the most exotic objects in the universe. They are leftover objects from the death of massive stars. They are as heavy as the moon but much more dense, being averages of several kilometers of matter packed into a volume of a few kilometers. Their interior, the so-called  nuclear sphere,  is rich in neutrons, almost half of the volume being comprised of neutrons held together with the strong force. This neutron matter is the most dense matter in the universe, similar in density to a large tumor on a human being. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a  deep crust,  essentially a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, and finally an outer layer of hydrogen and helium. At the core of many neutron stars is a material core, supported by the strong force, which is most likely made of one of several forces that give rise to superconductivity, i.e, Fermi, Coorbital, U(1) or colour superconductivity. Type II superconductivity occurs in metals at low temperatures. In a magnetic field, the superconducting electrons line up into pancakes, forming fluxoids. The resulting field is maximal at the mid-plane of the star and tapers off near the surface. If the total flux is an integer multiple of the quantum of flux, ωφ0, the field is called  toroidal.  Depending on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the condensation energy, this field is either stable or unstable. In this work, we study a subset of the stable solutions, those with integral flux quanta. We find that the ratio of the toroidal field energy to the rest of the star goes as the fifth power of the field strength, so there is little free energy in the field at typical neutron star fields. The field lines then naturally bundle in flux bundles of integral quanta. For a strong enough magnetic field, there is a discontinuity in the poloidal magnetic field, and the field is called force-free. This situation arises when there is a magnetic field-induced modification to the equation of state for the superconductor, so the magnetic and condensation energies are not in balance. A toroidal field modifies the structure of a neutron star in two primary ways. The magnetic pressure is enhanced in the core, increasing the pressure even as the density drops. This affects the dynamics of the inner crust, and the magnetic fields generated in this process. Second, if the field is strong enough, it",

        "rewrite_text": "Using computational simulations, we explore the characteristics of toroidal magnetic fields in neutron stars that possess type II superconductor cores. Our findings indicate that, across a wide range of physically viable parameters, these magnetic fields exist as stable, permanent structures rather than being susceptible to instability. Furthermore, we discover that such magnetic forces influence the composition of neutron stars and affect their thermal interactions. Our results offer new insights into the nature of certain magnetars and propose novel theories regarding signal emissions from these celestial bodies. Neutron stars are among the rarest entities in the universe, remnants of massive stars that have reached the end of their life cycles. They possess a mass comparable to that of the moon but are incredibly dense, with matter concentrated in a volume only a few kilometers wide. Their interiors, known as the nuclear sphere, are rich in neutrons, forming a structure held together by the strong nuclear force. This neutron matter represents the densest form of matter in the universe, akin to a significant tumor in a human body regarding volume. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a thick mantle composed mainly of a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, topped with an outer shell of carbon and helium. At the core of many neutron stars lies a metallic nucleus, supported by strong nuclear forces, and likely involving various mechanisms that lead to superconductivity, including Fermi, coorbital, U(1), or color superconductivity. Type II superconductivity occurs in metals at low temperatures, leading to the arrangement of superconducting nuclei into pancake-like structures known as fluxoids when subjected to magnetic currents. The resulting magnetic field peaks at the star's mid-plane and diminishes towards its surface. When the total magnetic flux is an integer multiple of the quantum of flux (ωφ0), the field is classified as toroidal. The stability of the magnetic field depends on the ratio of magnetic energy to condensation power, and in this study, we focus on a subset of stable solutions characterized by integral flux quanta. We observe that the ratio of toroidal field energy to the star's overall energy scales with the fifth power of the field's intensity, indicating that typical neutron star magnetic fields do not contain free energy. Consequently, the field lines naturally group into bundles of integral quanta. In instances of sufficiently strong magnetic forces, we observe a discontinuity in the poloidal magnetic force, leading to a force-free condition. This phenomenon arises when corrections to the equation of state for the superconductor, caused by the magnetic field, result in an imbalance between magnetic and condensation energies. A toroidal magnetic field influences the evolution of a neutron star in two main ways. First, it enhances magnetic pressure in the core, thereby increasing the pressure, particularly as density diminishes, affecting the dynamics of the inner crust and generating magnetic waves. Secondly, if the field's strength is sufficient, it...",

The nonstationarity originates from the rapid changing of the network structure and/or nodes’ dynamics. Since the network is nonstationary, the conventional network measures cannot fully reflect the network characteristics.

The analysis on the generated model and empirical data shows that the nonstationary complex networks are very common in real-world networks, such as the dynamic network and brain network. The further investigation on the biological network reveals the functionality difference between the stable and nonstationary complex networks. The nonstationary complex networks have broad implications in the real-world networks. For example, the brain network and large biological network are usually modeled as stationary networks, where the complex dynamics cannot be captured.

This nonstationarity arises from rapid alterations in the network's structure and the dynamics of its nodes. Because the network is nonstationary, traditional network analyses fail to adequately capture its characteristics. To address this, the study employs a recurrence plot model to analyze the network structure and proposes a method for quantifying nonstationarity. Evaluations of the developed model and real-world data indicate that nonstationary complex networks are prevalent in real-time systems, such as dynamic networks and brain systems. Further research on biological networks uncovers functional differences between stable and nonstationary complex networks. These findings suggest that nonstationary complex networks have significant implications for real-time systems. For example, while the brain and large biological networks are often modeled as static systems that overlook complex dynamics, nonstationary complex networks reveal essential dynamical processes. As a result, they can facilitate more accurate outcomes in applications such as disease modeling and dynamic forecasting.",

Due to the relatively high gas content of these galaxies, they often have detectable rotating disks of cold gas, which are often also embedded in dust. The presence of these circumnuclear disks was discovered relatively recently. Despite its cosmological significance, the physics of the formation and the stability of these disks remains obscure. A number of researchers have claimed that CNTs are gravitationally unstable. These claims have not yet been convincingly proven either by laboratory experiments or by computer simulations. It is therefore difficult to make accurate predictions about the nature and properties of these structures. This work attempts to study the problem of gravitational stability of CNTs using modern methods of computer simulations. The study was performed using the GRaphic PAthway Code (GPU-PCM), which is a highly efficient parallel computer code for solving the equations of hydrodynamics on a grid. The experiments were performed for a model of an elliptical galaxy with a low-mass companion, and for a model with a long-term evolution. The experiments have confirmed the dynamical stability of circumnuclear disks in both cases, and the specific angular momentum of the disk material was preserved over time. The simulations also revealed the complex spatial structure of the circumnuclear disks, with a complex patchwork of nonaxisymmetric clumps. However, it was not possible to determine the existence of a firmly established fundamental mode of the system. It is therefore difficult to state unequivocally that the structures observed in the simulations are stable in the strict sense. However, it was demonstrated that the tested models had sufficient parameters to reproduce the observed properties of real galaxies with circumnuclear disks.",

        "rewrite_text": "The stability of circumnuclear tori (CNTs) in elliptical galaxies is a significant topic in contemporary astronomy. These galaxies often exhibit high gas content, leading to the presence of observable spinning disks of cold gas, which are frequently situated within clouds. The discovery of these circumnuclear belts is relatively recent. Despite their cosmological relevance, the physics behind the formation and stability of these disks remains largely unknown. Some studies have suggested that CNTs are gravitationally fragile; however, these claims have not been convincingly substantiated through research or computer simulations. This uncertainty complicates our ability to accurately assess the nature and structure of these formations. This research aims to address the gravitational stability of CNTs utilizing modern computational simulation techniques. The study employed the GRaphic PAthway Code (GPU-PCM), an efficient parallel computing tool for solving hydrodynamic equations on a grid. Simulations were conducted on an elliptical galaxy interacting with both a small companion and a large, long-term evolving system. The results confirmed the dynamical stability of circumnuclear disks in both scenarios, revealing that the specific angular momentum of the disk matter remained consistent over time. Additionally, the simulations highlighted the intricate spatial configuration of the circumnuclear disks, featuring a complex array of non-axisymmetric clumps. However, the research did not uncover a definitive fundamental mechanism for the model, making it challenging to conclude with certainty that the structures identified in the simulations are stable in a strict sense. Nonetheless, the examined theories presented sufficient parameters to closely approximate the known characteristics of real galaxies with circumnuclear disks.",

This phenomenon, referred to as dark energy, is evidenced by the accelerated expansion of the cosmos. It is believed that this pervasive energy constitutes about 68% of the universe's total energy budget. According to general relativity, dark energy should cause gravitational forces to strengthen with distance, resulting in greater velocity increases for objects moving toward a galaxy's center. However, galaxy rotation curves have shown shallower profiles than expected, possibly indicating the existence of dark matter, which interacts with bright energy to create observable gravitational effects. Dark matter is thought to account for approximately 26% of the universe's energy. It is suggested that dark matter and dark energy only interact on cosmic scales, allowing for manifestations of bright energy at the galactic level, while dark energy dominates beyond that. This brane theory maintains a similar soft gravitational field on smaller scales as predicted by general relativity but proposes different interactions at those scales. Recent studies indicate that the universe may actually be four-dimensional, with matter residing on a three-dimensional brane.

In our system, the platelike particles feature two equal square-shaped heads with a size of d, while the spherical particles have a diameter of d/2. We examine the dynamical properties of the system across a volume fraction range of 0.621 to 0.895, with an average number of platelike particles (NPl) set at 100, 200, and 300. Within this range of volume fractions and NPl, we analyze both transient and long-term dynamical behaviors characterized by the self-intermediate scattering function S(q, t) and the pair-intermediate scattering function S(q, t) for various values of q. Our findings reveal key dynamical features, including the exponential decay of transients, quasiequilibration, and the evolution of correlation functions that approach complete hydrodynamics over extended time periods.",

The behavior of such quantum fields underlie all known interactions.

If we extrapolate the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest possible energies, we expect the particle exchanges to involve gravitons, which could explain the observed gravity, and, possibly, also photons and fermions. In this work, we discuss the first option. Gravitons are the expected carrier of the gravitational interaction, which otherwise feels indirect through intermediate messengers. Photons and fermions are the two most massive particles in the SM. Therefore, it seems plausible that they could be the corresponding force carriers. However, the fact that they are spin-1/2 fermions rather than spin-2 bosons has so far prevented them from being observed. In this work, we propose a way for photons and fermions to interact directly, through a new Lorentz- and CPT-violating term in the Standard Model Lagrangian. We present a way to test this proposal in current and future colliders. Gravitons carry both the gravitational and Lorentz-violation interactions, leading to a unique signature of completely missing particles, with two corresponding jets emerging at high invariant mass. Photons and fermions only carry the gravitational interaction. Therefore, their phenomenological implications are different. Photons and fermions can decay to gravitons, so the signature would be two jets plus missing energy. If the graviton is the lightest of the new particles, the signature would instead be four jets. An excess of any of these signatures would be a hint of the underlying theory, which could also give an explanation for dark matter and the strong and weak forces.",

The dynamics of these quantum fields form the foundation of all known interactions. In particular, their exchanges contribute to the stability of the Standard Model (SM) electric current, the molecular spin, and the nature of interactions. By extending the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest available energy levels, we anticipate that particle exchanges will include gravitons, potentially accounting for the observed gravity, along with photons and fermions. In this study, we focus on the first aspect. Gravitons are theorized to be the mediators of gravitational interactions, which are otherwise experienced indirectly through intermediate particles. Photons and fermions represent the two most significant particle types in the SM, suggesting that they might serve as effective force carriers. However, their classification as spin-1/2 fermions, rather than spin-2 bosons, has thus far hindered their detection. We propose a mechanism for photons and fermions to interact directly through a novel term in the Standard Model Lagrangian that violates Lorentz and CPT symmetries. We identify potential tests for this hypothesis at current and future collider experiments. Gravitons are expected to mediate both gravitational and Lorentz-violating interactions, resulting in a distinctive signature characterized by a lack of detectable particles, alongside the emergence of two jets with high invariant mass. In contrast, photons and fermions only convey gravitational interactions, leading to unique phenomenological outcomes. Moreover, photons and fermions could evolve into gravitons, potentially yielding signatures of two jets plus missing energy. If gravitons are the lightest of these new entities, the signature could manifest as four jets. An observed excess of any of these signatures could provide clues about the underlying fundamental theory, which may also explain dark matter and the strong and weak forces.",

We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region.

We find a strong dependence of the survival of satellite galaxies on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, and on their orbital parameters. Satellite galaxies that are on highly eccentric orbits are much more likely to survive for several crossing times than those on more circular orbits. Satellites on prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those on retrograde orbits, and satellites on highly radial orbits are more likely to survive than those on low-radius orbits. Satellite galaxies that form near the center of their host are more likely to survive than those that form far from the center. We also find that the internal structures of galaxies, as measured by their phase-space structure, are a better predictor of the fate of satellites than their dark matter halos.

N-body simulations have proven to be effective in predicting the frequency and structure of satellite galaxies, but they still require observationally informed adjustments that consider the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been identified within cosmological simulations of dark matter, even without accounting for baryonic physics that may adversely affect them. In this study, we employ a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations to investigate the relationship between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. Our findings reveal a significant dependence of satellite star survival on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, as well as their orbital characteristics. Satellite galaxies on highly eccentric orbits are considerably more likely to endure over numerous crossing times compared to those on more circular orbits. Additionally, satellites in prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those in retrograde orbits, and those on highly radial paths have a greater chance of survival compared to those on smaller-radius orbits. Satellites that form closer to their host's center are also more likely to persist than those that originate farther out. Furthermore, we find that the internal structures of the stars, assessed through their phase-space formation, are more indicative of a satellite’s fate than their dark matter halos. Specifically, satellites on radial or highly eccentric orbits tend to lose a significant number of stars from their outer regions. The time until total stellar removal varies with orbital type, with radial orbits exhibiting greater instability than more circular ones. Ultimately, our research underscores the substantial role that mergers play in the formation and evolution of satellite galaxies observed in the present universe.",

Due to their relatively large size and high degree of stiffness, bottlebrush polymers are often unable to adapt to the irregularities in their embedding environments, and consequently exhibit inadequate processability and function in solution or the solid state. The problem of stiffness can be mitigated by incorporating chemically crosslinkable side chains on the bottlebrush, thereby allowing the brush segments to be crosslinked once for a global change in the stiffness of the brush. However, the brush and crosslinker segments then come into close proximity, and in the absence of specific non-covalent interactions, may undergo crosslinking, even at low degrees of conversion. Here we show that mutual interaction between the brush and crosslinker segments – namely π-π interaction between the side chain polymers and Flory-Huggins interaction between the fluorocarbon and carbon backbone polymers – leads to crosslinking-induced softening of the brush stiffness. This approach allows independent control of stiffness and processability of bottlebrush polymers through appropriate selection of non-covalent and covalent interactions. The approach is validated by rheological and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a bottlebrush polymer in which the brush is formed by ethyloxazoline monomers and the side chains are formed by tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TMSSI). Mutual interaction between TMSSI side chains and ethyloxazoline brush segments leads to a large decrease in the bottlebrush stiffness without a significant change in the weight average molecular weight. A novel two-step crosslinking approach is developed that enables gradual and controllable crosslinking of the TMSSI side chains in a spatially and temporally decoupled manner from global crosslinking of the ethyloxazoline brush segments.

        "rewrite_text": "Bottlebrush polymers are macromolecules characterized by a complex “brush” structure, where polymeric end chains are covalently linked to a central “backbone” chain. Their large size and significant stiffness often prevent bottlebrush polymers from adapting to the irregularities of their surrounding environments, leading to challenges in processability and functionality in solution or liquid form. This stiffness issue can be addressed by adding chemically crosslinkable side rings to the bottlebrush, enabling crosslinking of the brush sections to globally adjust the stiffness. However, the close proximity of the brush and crosslinker portions, combined with a lack of specific non-covalent interactions, can result in unintended crosslinking even at low transformation degrees. In this study, we demonstrate that cooperative interactions between the brush and crosslinker strands—specifically, the π-π interactions between the front chain polymers and the Flory-Huggins effect between the fluorocarbon and carbon backbone polymers—contribute to a softening of the brush stiffness due to crosslinking. This approach allows for independent manipulation of stiffness and processability in bottlebrush polymers by carefully selecting non-covalent and covalent interactions. We validate this strategy through rheological measurements and small-angle X-ray scattering studies on a bottlebrush polymer composed of ethyloxazoline monomers and tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TMSSI) as the front chains. The interaction between the TMSSI side rings and the ethyloxazoline brush components results in a significant reduction in bottlebrush stiffness without a notable change in weight-average molecular weight. We have developed a novel two-phase crosslinking method that facilitates gradual and controlled crosslinking of the TMSSI side rings, decoupled both spatially and temporally from the overall crosslinking of the ethyloxazoline brush sections. This technique offers a robust strategy for independently tuning processability and stiffness in bottlebrush polymers, with wide-ranging applications across various bottlebrush architectures.",

It has been theorized that quantum gravitational effects could yield a positive cosmological constant, suggesting a relationship where AdS space corresponds to an inflationary universe. Therefore, investigating quantum effects in AdS spaces may provide a potential explanation for the small yet non-zero cosmological constant. However, since AdS spaces possess a time-like curvature, the physics in the boundary conformal field theory lacks a time direction.

This method involves dividing the source message into layers and encoding these layers with a long block length, relying on accurate knowledge of the lower layer headers. The headers themselves are encoded using shorter block lengths, assuming that there is only partial knowledge of the lower layer headers. This approach enables the optimization of coding speed across a Gaussian distribution, resulting in an effective layered coding technique that can approach the capacity of the underlying multi-user discrete memoryless channel (DMMC) within 1 character per channel use for large channels of interest. However, successive refinement tends to introduce accumulated degradation that grows with the length of the encoding block. Specifically, for a DMMC with storage size K, if the coding block speed does not exceed a certain threshold (known as the max-delay), the distortion increases linearly with the block length. When the block speed surpasses this threshold (referred to as the delay-limited regime), the distortion can still increase at most linearly with the block depth. The exact rate of increase in the delay-limited regime, termed the delay-regime slope, has only been defined for a limited number of DMMC cases. In this paper, we derive a general outcome for the delay-limited regime curve, which is shown to align with the latest results for several specific instances, including the Hyperlabel Broadcast Channel (HLC) and the Gaussian Multi-Unicast with Successive Refinement (MUSIC).",

These factors are tailored to different types of stars and categorized for Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, and Irr objects.

This work introduces an initial method applicable to a wide range of problems. For instance, the formulation is applied to the issue of water-saturated soil subjected to water movement. The yield surface is defined as a penalty function based on the absolute differences between the local equivalent saturation and the target value. Additionally, the disparity between the actual pressure and the imposed tension—termed enthalpy—is addressed. The results obtained are compared to those from traditional methods used in rupture analysis under flow conditions. The proposed approach offers a more mechanically realistic perspective and reduces the number of iterations needed for stabilization.",

In this scenario, the observable universe is viewed as a three-brane that is a domain wall living in the AdS space. In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced. This field, called the chameleon field, couples to the world volume of the brane via the Israel coupling, where the coupling strength is related to the brane tension. By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass. With explicit breaking, the scalar masses can be naturally of order one, if some conditions are satisfied on the soft parameters. Our results suggest that in order to explain the 4D gravity we live in from the 5D fundamental theory, the theory might be supersymmetric on the brane. Supersymmetry breaking on the brane naturally explains the hierarchy between the Planck and the Electroweak scales without postulating large extra dimensions, and thus provides a rationale for low fundamental gravity scale.",

Here, the observable universe is conceptualized as a three-brane acting as a domain wall in the AdS space. To mitigate curvature instabilities at the domain's boundary, we introduce a bulk scalar field, known as the chameleon field, which interacts with the brane's size through the Israel coupling, with its interaction strength linked to the brane tension. Analyzing the equations of motion allows us to derive conditions for the brane tension and bulk potential, ensuring the model demonstrates stable 4D gravitational behavior at low energy levels. Using these conditions, we also establish a natural derivation for the mass of the Planck particle. Furthermore, we investigate the notion of supersymmetry breaking on the brane. To achieve this, we incorporate explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms into the brane supergravity Lagrangian. Our findings indicate that, in the absence of explicit breaking, all scalar masses depend solely on the brane tension and gravitino mass, thus naturally aligning with the gravitino mass scale. However, with explicit breaking, scalar masses can achieve values of order one, provided certain conditions on the soft variables are met. Overall, our results suggest that to account for the 4D gravity we observe as arising from a 5D fundamental theory, the model may inherently possess supersymmetry on the brane. The breaking of supersymmetry on the brane effectively explains the hierarchy between the Planck and Electroweak scales without the need for additional small dimensions, thereby offering a justification for a low fundamental gravitational dimension.",

In my reanalysis of the same data, I determined that it actually does support solid-like behavior while also exhibiting liquid-like qualities for the specific composition of the sample. The authors propose that the observed frequency dependence of the Poisson ratio aligns more closely with liquid-like behavior rather than solid-like behavior. While the data may appear to favor a liquid-like interpretation, it remains uncertain whether this frequency dependence genuinely reflects such behavior. Notably, in the authors' own Figure 3, the Poisson ratio does not approach -1 at low frequencies—this is the value expected for a liquid. Furthermore, they did not investigate the liquid physics prediction that the Poisson ratio should be independent of amplitude if the sample is truly a liquid. Additional evidence from varying frequencies is needed to support a more definitive conclusion. The section could benefit from a deeper analysis of the existing data to achieve a more quantitative outcome.",

Strong lensing is more effective for clusters at lower redshifts, resulting in the observed quasars being drawn from a relatively higher mass population compared to those typically analyzed in X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich studies. A subset of known quasars underwent spectroscopic observations using the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite, with thirty-three quasars showing no absorbed lines, thereby establishing a minimum limit on the neutral hydrogen proportion of approximately 10^-6. If a significant portion of the mass in clusters does indeed consist of dark matter, it may effectively thermalize and become indistinguishable from cool gray matter at the cluster scale, which could imply that the neutral hydrogen ratio is even lower, around 10^-9, beyond the current sensitivity limit of FUSE. The findings from HST, with compelling lensing evidence from 45 of the 62 quasars in the sample, represent the most comprehensive assessment of the cluster mass-to-light ratio to date.",

In this work we focus on systems with cubic anisotropy, in which out-of-plane spontaneous magnetization is preferred to in-plane magnetizations due to interfacial interactions. Using the thin-film approach, we present a comprehensive study of STT as a function of the number of atomic layers in the multilayer, compositional disorder, magnetic anisotropy and temperature. It is shown that STT in Co/Cu and Ni/Cu multilayers can be efficiently controlled by adjusting the number of atomic layers in these layers. Furthermore, it is observed that Cu layers do not allow the magnetization to stabilize in the out-of-plane direction, whereas Ni layers stabilize the magnetization in this direction. Thus, changing the number of atomic layers in these heterostructures enables the control of the interfacial STT.

In conventional (CPP) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the spin-polarized current flowing across the interface between the ferromagnet and the tunnel junction leads to a spin-transfer torque (STT) that can rotate the magnetic direction of the free ferromagnetic layer. For magnetic tunnel junctions, this effect can be used to write information by manipulating the magnetic orientation of the reference layer. Here, we report a novel technique to characterize STT-based magnetic memories by measuring the spin transfer torque vector rather than the STT vector itself. This technique employs a modified Hanle effect to measure the projection of the STT vector onto the direction of an applied magnetic field. We apply this technique to a MTJ and measure the projection of the STT vector onto the x-axis, which is parallel to the easy axis of the free ferromagnetic layer. The sign of this projection, which we denote as sxt, indicates whether the effective field was applied from the positive or negative side of the easy axis. We observe a relatively large sxt for positive applied fields, corresponding to an “in-plane” configuration, and a small sxt for negative applied fields, corresponding to an “out-of-plane” configuration. This technique enables measurement of the projection of the STT vector onto a fixed direction, rather than the measurement of the STT vector itself, which has been the standard for decades. The advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to any STT-based devices, including STT MRAMs, STT spin valves, and STT thin film transistors. Thus, it can be used to characterize device performance and map the device write fields and switching currents.

        "rewrite_text": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which feature a configuration of a MgO barrier layer positioned between two ferromagnetic layers (the tunneling layer and reference layer), provide a method for monitoring high-density magnetic memories and magnetic logic. In conventional current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the spin-polarized current that flows across the interface between the ferromagnet and the tunnel junction generates a spin transfer torque (STT), capable of altering the magnetic orientation of the free ferromagnetic layer. This effect can be exploited to write information by adjusting the magnetic alignment of the reference layer. In this study, we present a novel technique for characterizing STT-based magnetic memories by focusing on the spin transfer torque function, rather than the STT vector itself. This approach utilizes a modified Hanle effect to gauge the projection of the STT vector in the direction of an applied magnetic field. We apply this methodology to an MTJ, measuring the projection of the STT vector along the x-axis, which aligns with the easy axis of the free ferromagnetic layer. The sign of this projection, defined as sxt, indicates whether the effective field originates from the positive or negative side of the easy axis. We observe a relatively large sxt under positive applied fields, corresponding to an \"in-plane\" configuration, and a smaller sxt for negative applied fields, resembling an \"out-of-plane\" configuration. This technique allows for the measurement of the STT vector's projection along a specific trajectory, rather than measuring the STT vector directly, which has been the conventional method for many years. The advantage of this new methodology is its applicability to various STT-based sensors, particularly STT MRAMs, STT spintronic devices, and STT narrow film transistors. Consequently, it can be utilized to evaluate device performance and monitor device writing paths and switching currents.

These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory.

These solutions suggest an early phase of inflation, followed by a de Sitter epoch. We also examine the feasibility of positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, particularly since only closed string systems are known to exhibit negative curvature. Inflation, characterized by a rapid expansion of the early universe, is supported by both observational evidence and theoretical frameworks within superstring theory. Typically, vacuum energy in superstring physics is positive; however, various supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenarios can yield vacuum energies with differing signs. Therefore, to achieve an inflationary state in superstring theories, it is essential to ensure the vacuum energy remains positive. This paper demonstrates that a combination of compactifications, axion fields, and multiple uplifting fields can generate an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring contexts. While such inflationary de Sitter scenarios have previously been derived from supergravity, we derive them here from superstring principles, which is significant as it could lead to observable differences between the two frameworks. For instance, the graviton zero-mode contributes to vacuum energy in supergravity but not in superstring theory. Consequently, observational aspects like the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may help differentiate between these two approaches. Furthermore, there is a notable contrast in the energy scales for collider studies: in superstring theory, graviton and related particle masses are expected to be around \\(10^{15}\\) GeV, while in supergravity, they are considerably lower, around \\(10^{16}\\) GeV. Therefore, should future research detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, it could suggest that inflation occurred in the early universe as predicted by superstring theory. This paper serves as an initial investigation into inflation within superstring theory, leaving many intriguing questions unaddressed. For example, if we aim to achieve \\(N\\)th order inflation with \\(N > 2\\), we will need a more detailed analysis of higher-order corrections to both the superpotential and the Kähler potential. It's also essential to consider a variety of moduli and external field values, alongside the dependence on the broader landscape of string theory. Additionally, the effects of moduli stabilization on vacuum energy and the potential for precise cosmological predictions must be examined. Lastly, the proposed collider signatures should be adjusted within the comprehensive framework of superstring theory. While this paper presents a novel avenue for realizing inflationary cosmology through superstrings, we acknowledge that further research is necessary to bring this potential to fruition. Inflationary dynamics in superstring theory could have substantial implications for the vacua landscape, particularly during a period of superstring influence.",

However, existing localized support for injection point election (LSE) mechanisms for hybrid networks cannot guarantee the election of a same injection point (IP) among all the networks, which restricts their applicability in hybrid networks. In this paper, we propose a localized supported injection point election (LSIPE) mechanism, which ensures that all the networks will elect to the same injection point. Moreover, we prove that LSIPE is close to optimal with respect to the objective of maximizing the minimum network utility while guaranteeing that the same injection point is elected among all the networks. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LSIPE mechanism.  LSIPE mechanism is a novel localized support for injection point election (LSE) mechanism for hybrid networks. In hybrid networks, some physical networks and virtual networks coexist, and each physical network or virtual network can connect to multiple other physical networks or virtual networks. Thus, the network injection management in hybrid networks becomes a multipoint-to-multipoint problem, which is much more complex than the point-to-point problem in single networks. Existing LSE mechanisms for single networks cannot guarantee the election of a same injection point (IP) among all the networks.

        "rewrite_text": "Hybrid networks have become increasingly valuable in modern communication technologies, offering advantages such as improved network robustness and enhanced connection security. However, existing localized support for injection point election (LSE) schemes in hybrid networks often fails to ensure the selection of a consistent injection point (IP) across all connections, which limits their effectiveness in these environments. In this paper, we introduce a localized supported injection point election (LSIPE) process that guarantees all connections will select the same injection point. Additionally, we demonstrate that LSIPE is nearly optimal in terms of maximizing average network utility while ensuring uniformity in the chosen injection point across connections. Our comprehensive simulations confirm the performance and efficiency of the proposed LSIPE system, which represents a novel approach to injection point election in hybrid networks. In these networks, multiple physical and virtual systems coexist, and each physical or virtual entity can connect with several others, transforming channel injection management into a complex multipoint-to-multipoint issue—far more intricate than the point-to-point challenges faced in single networks. Existing LSE approaches for single networks do not ensure a unified injection point across all connections. Thus, we propose the LSIPE system, which successfully addresses the need for a consistent injection point across connections. We also establish that LSIPE is close to optimal for maximizing the minimum connection utility while maintaining a consistent injection point. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews related literature, Section III outlines the system model, Section IV details the proposed LSIPE system, Section V presents performance evaluations and assessments, and Section VI concludes our findings.",

These universal invariants satisfy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, a calculation of the fundamental group, and the universal coefficients theorem. In this framework, the strong Novikov conjecture, which states that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are universal among degree-one cohomology classes, is equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This implies that the higher K-groups satisfy the Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, under certain hypotheses, also detect exotic elements in the stable homology of manifolds. We also establish twisted versions of these universal invariants and apply them to the Bismut intersection formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants extends to other stable homotopy theories, such as bordism and generalized cohomology. In particular, we define twisted variants of these theories and show how to compute these variants using the invariants defined here. This approach unifies the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a single universal theory of stable derived functors. In particular, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory arises as the key element in the localization process. In addition to defining this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also calculate its rationalization. This provides a powerful way to determine the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, which may be of independent interest.

        "rewrite_text": "This paper introduces universal invariants for higher K-theory and enlarged signatures, illustrating their significance by differentiating the higher K-theory of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups. These universal invariants adhere to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence associated with topological K-theory, calculations of fundamental groups, and the universal coefficients theorem. Within this framework, the strong Novikov theorem—which asserts that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are intrinsic to degree-one cohomology groups—parallels the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. Consequently, this suggests that the higher K-families are consistent with the Hirzebruch signature theorem and, under specific conditions, also exhibit exotic components within the stable homology of manifolds. Furthermore, we develop twisted versions of these universal invariants and extend their application to the Bismut interchange formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. Our approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants is applicable to other stable homotopy theories, including bordism and generalized cohomology. Specifically, we define twisted forms of these theories and demonstrate how to compute these variants using the invariants introduced herein. This methodology provides a unifying perspective on K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by treating these theories as localizations of a singular universal theory of stable derived functors, with the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory emerging as a central component in this localization process. Alongside the definition of this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also delineate its rationalization, which offers a robust approach for deriving the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, potentially holding independent significance.

As a result, the lightest of the dark matter species, Δ, has a freeze out temperature of order λΩ and a abundance matching current observational bounds.

Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters.

It includes measurements of how the magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic elements varies with temperature, external fields, and direct current (DC) magnetic bias fields. The dependencies of magnetic susceptibility on temperature and external fields for (anti)ferromagnetic elements are analyzed. Notably, the application of a DC magnetic bias in (planar) antiferromagnets results in a net magnetization that is proportional to the square of the applied bias. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility of antiferromagnets can be characterized by the total spin, representing the sum of the susceptibilities of individual atomic spins. This leads to saturation of the overall susceptibility under high field conditions. These observations on susceptibility may facilitate the characterization of various substances and act as a sensitive tool for exploring new classes of magnetic materials, such as high-temperature ferromagnets and antiferromagnets.

This leads to the mobilization of calcium via a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C cascade. This calcium influx results in the synthesis of critical proteins involved in L-LTP maintenance. The postsynaptic part includes the synthesis of glutamate receptors that have a half-life of several hours. Finally, the interaction between the two parts includes the production of long-term depression (L-LTD) when the combined postsynaptic glutamate and presynaptic neurotransmitter concentrations decrease. Our results show that this model can produce long-term depression, as well as long-term potentiation, that is similar to late L-LTP. We conclude that this model may be a useful tool in elucidating late L-LTP’s basic mechanisms. Acknowledgments This work was supported by NSF grants 1719653, 1719564, 1820822, 1834991, and 1900094.

Late Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), also known as Long-Term Memory, depends on the presynaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and postsynaptic protein synthesis. Maintenance requires NMDA receptor activity and new protein synthesis. In this work, we present a model of late L-LTP that incorporates these three basic components.

        "rewrite_text": "Late Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), also referred to as Long-Term Memory, depends on the presynaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and the metabolism of postsynaptic proteins. Its maintenance requires the activity of NMDA receptors and the synthesis of new proteins. In this study, we propose a theory of L-LTP that integrates these three fundamental components. Our model can also produce long-term depression (L-LTD) and long-term memory, phenomena that are similarly associated with L-LTP. Therefore, this model could serve as a valuable tool for understanding the basic mechanisms underlying L-LTP.\n\nThe model consists of three main sections: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and the interaction between them. The presynaptic section involves the activation of mGluRs in response to an increase in neurotransmitter concentration, leading to calcium mobilization via a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C cascade. This calcium influx facilitates the production of key molecules involved in sustaining L-LTP. The postsynaptic section addresses the synthesis of glutamate receptors, which have a lifespan of several hours. Finally, the interaction between the presynaptic and postsynaptic components results in L-LTD when the levels of glutamate and presynaptic neurotransmitters decrease. Our findings indicate that this model effectively generates both long-term depression and long-term potentiation related to late L-LTP, suggesting it may be a useful resource for clarifying the mechanisms of L-LTP.\n\nAcknowledgments: This research was funded by NSF grants 1719653, 1719564, 1820822, 1834991, and 1900094.

Fluid mechanics, in turn, is the study of fluid behavior not involving radiation or mechanical phenomena. The dynamics of a viscous fluid may be described by the hydrodynamic equations: the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of fluid mass; the fluid velocity, which is the statement of Newton s law of motion, and an appropriate velocity specification such as no flow across boundaries (no slip) or in canals (zero shear); and the conservation of momentum, which is the statement of force production due to contact friction and other sources not already included in the fluid mass equation.

General relativity is one of the most comprehensive and successful descriptions of the laws of physics, accounting for all known forms of energy, including mass-energy and matter, electromagnetic, and nuclear energy.

The dynamics of a viscous fluid can be modeled using hydrodynamic equations, which include the continuity equation for mass conservation, the equations of motion guided by Newton's laws, and boundary conditions like no flow across surfaces (no-slip) and within channels (zero shear). Additionally, the conservation of momentum accounts for forces arising from contact drag and other factors not represented in the mass equations.\n\nGeneral relativity explores the influence of gravity on light propagation and stands as one of the most rigorous explanations of physical laws, encompassing all known forms of energy, including mass-energy, electromagnetic, and nuclear energy. The theory delineates the dynamics of spacetime and the very fabric of spacetime itself. It emerged from efforts to reconcile Isaac Newton's principles of gravity with an accurate description of celestial movements. While special relativity adeptly models light dynamics at stellar scales, Newtonian concepts fall short. Einstein's field equations exemplify the nonlinear framework of general relativity, and although no comprehensive solutions to these equations are known, Einstein enriched his theory with a framework for understanding gravitational interactions.",

        "original_text": "Massive black holes exist in all massive galaxies. They grow over time due to accretion of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity.

        "rewrite_text": "Massive black holes are found in all large astronomical objects and form over time through the accumulation of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which is derived from three key variables: the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion, and the radius of the dark hole’s influence. The first two variables can be measured directly in the galaxy, whereas the third can be determined from the dark hole’s mass. There is a strong correlation between the latter two variables, allowing for the estimation of the black hole's mass. This estimation has been made for a significant number of galaxies, revealing that more massive galaxies tend to harbor more massive black holes. This relationship can be expressed as a linear equation: M_BH = A × M_spheroid + B, where M_BH is the mass of the black hole, M_spheroid is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient approximately equal to 7, and B is a constant. This correlation has been confirmed across various Hubble types, particularly among early-type galaxies. The connections with the properties of the host stars are generally stronger for the spheroid mass than for the black hole mass, a phenomenon that may result from the merger-induced growth of red holes. To reduce scatter in this relationship, another observable, specifically the luminosity of the spheroid, can be employed. The luminosity can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of influence, which are already considered. The radius of influence can be derived from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It has been demonstrated that the scatter in the black hole mass-luminosity correlation is significantly lower than in other relationships, with the best-fit coefficient nearing 10, attributed to more precise measurements and reduced empirical scatter in spheroid luminosity. Consequently, it is proposed that the black hole mass-luminosity relation serves as a new standard for estimating black hole masses.

It is well-known that such theories can be obtained from the Lagrangian formulation of the celebrated Euler equation on the diffeomorphism group of a three dimensional Riemannian manifold. An equivalent Hamiltonian description using the theory of Lie groupoids and Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groupoids is proposed, and explicit constructions are given for some important special cases including fluid dynamics on Lie groups, Newtonian gravity on the special orthogonal group and the general linear group, and the classical ECSK theory of non-relativistic gravity. In the Hamiltonian description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics are described by a Lie groupoid, with the fluid dynamics being a particular case in which the source of the gauge groupoid morphism is the diffeomorphism group of the fluid domain. In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization. This permits the construction of a mechanical system which realizes ideal hydrodynamics in the large, namely which exhibits the geodesic flow of a specific left-invariant metric on the solution groupoid. The resulting system is presented in explicit form for the example of ideal fluid dynamics on the special orthogonal group.

In this work, we demonstrate that the precision of this physical realization of the quantum NOT gate is fundamentally limited by dissipation linked to the preservation of von Neumann entropy during the quantum system's dynamics. Specifically, we find that the infidelity of the quantum NOT gate in this context, due to entropy production, is constrained to below 0.067 over the timescales necessary for quantum computation, significantly surpassing other available physical methods for quantum computing. This research establishes a new standard for the precision of quantum computing, which can only be exceeded by techniques that involve error suppression through active control.

In this study, we provide a magnetic characterization of Co/Pt multilayer thin films produced through selective area epitaxy. Our X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements in the remanent state reveal the existence of a nanometer-scale uncompensated magnetic region at low temperatures.

We show that it is also consistent if the advection speed is linearly interpolated between the cell center and the boundary. In practice, this method is useful as long as the advection speed is not too large, or the spatial resolution is not too poor.

In all cases, solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale. In the second part, we study the effect of solids on the dust evolution in the disk.

We present several straightforward theories to analyze the effects of solids on dust evolution, revealing that solids of particular shapes and formations produce unique impacts on the dust size distribution. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the precise form of the size distribution holds limited significance for dust evolution in most regions of the disk; after approximately one million months, only larger grains remain, and the evolution is predominantly driven by dust settling and radial drift.

These are fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in an abrupt change of properties of a fluid, usually characterized by a supersonic flow jump. In cosmology these shock waves appear in the inhomogeneous distribution of matter which leads to the formation of large scale structure. There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the cosmological shock wave phenomenon. This is because new observational discoveries such as the 511 keV line, and highly contrasted galaxy clusters have shown the need to go beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. In the cosmological world, there is more variation in the matter density and velocity fields than what would be expected from a simple homogenous and isotropic model. It is now known that type 2 shock waves are generic features of cosmological fluid flows. Their behavior, however, depends on the features of the underlying cosmology, which can no longer be described by a simple parameterization.

        "rewrite_text": "The W3 giant molecular cloud (GMC) is a prominent region in the constellation Aquila, situated approximately 20 kiloparsecs away. It ranks among the nearest grand design spiral clusters and contains an exceptional grouping of large, young galaxies. Historically, W3 has served as a key example of GMCs with significant ongoing star formation. In this study, we present data from the Herschel Space Observatory, including far-infrared and submillimeter observations alongside molecular line and radio continuum data, to analyze the star formation activity within W3. The far-infrared and submillimeter emissions are excellent markers for thermal dust radiation, which is typically linked to young stellar regions. Our findings indicate that W3 possesses a bolometric luminosity of 9.5 x 10^9 [Units Unknown] and a total mass of 1.2 x 10^10 [Units Unknown]. With a column density of 1.87 x 10^21 cm^-2, its mass surface density is calculated to be 221 [Units Unknown] pc^-2. We estimate that W3 contains a mass of 250 x 10^3 [Units Unknown] within its determined star-formation density threshold of 2.2 x 10^4 [Units Unknown] pc^-2. This suggests that while star formation is an ongoing process in W3, it is not currently active. Thus, W3 may not fit the conventional definition of a GMC with significant sustained star formation; instead, it represents a vast, very young (5-10 million years) and extremely dense region that is conducive to star formation but remains in a quiescent state.",

        "original_text": "Manganese and other rare earths are examples of impurities that may localize in the interstitial sites of the semiconductor host lattice. Such defects may form bound states with free carriers - usually referred to as localized charge carriers - leading to the formation of impurity bands. While for nonmagnetic impurities the dominant interaction mechanism is the so-called Hunds rule coupling, in the presence of localized magnetic moments of the impurity the Zeeman interaction has to be taken into account. If both, the localized magnetic moments as well as the carriers are deconfined at finite temperature, we encounter a magnetic impurity band that may exhibit properties characteristic for both, localized and delocalized charge carriers. In order to understand the nature of the impurity band we study for the case of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) the crossover from localized to delocalized charge carriers via a systematic variation of the Coulomb attraction by the acceptor. In this context the physical concept of Wannier functions is employed to describe the spatial extent and localizability of the impurity band wave functions. The Coulomb attraction by the acceptor is modeled by a dielectric background in order to account for the screening behavior of the charge carriers in the valence band. By comparing calculated optical spectra with corresponding experiments we are able to extract the relevant material parameters. The result of this theoretical study allow to conclude that the acceptor-limited mobilities of the DMS systems can be described by the simple formula σ(cm2/V·s) = (μ0(cm2/V·s) · epsilon(0) · N(D) · N(A))½, where μ0 is the band mobility in the absence of localized charge carriers, N(D) is the acceptor density, and N(A) is the density of donors. Hence, for a fixed acceptor density, the acceptor-limited carrier mobility in diluted magnetic semiconductors is only determined by the density of donors. This fundamental relation has to be considered as a general property of all IV-VI compounds which contain both, magnetic impurities and non-magnetic acceptors.",

        "rewrite_text": "Manganese and other rare earth elements can act as impurities that settle in the interstitial spaces of a semiconductor's host structure. These defects may create bound states with loosely associated carriers, commonly referred to as localized charge carriers, thereby resulting in the formation of impurity groups. For non-magnetic impurities, the primary interaction mechanism is known as Hund's rule coupling. However, when localized magnetic moments from the impurities are present, the Zeeman interaction must also be taken into account. If both the localized magnetic moments and the carriers are free at finite temperatures, a magnetic impurity band may form that displays characteristics of both confined and delocalized charge carriers. To elucidate the nature of this impurity band, we examine the behavior of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) as we systematically vary the Coulomb bonding associated with the acceptor. We employ the concept of Wannier functions to clarify the spatial extent and localizability of the impurity band wave functions. The Coulomb interaction with the acceptor is modeled using a dielectric background to account for the screening effects on the charge carriers within the valence band. By aligning our calculated magnetic spectra with experimental data, we can determine the relevant material properties. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the acceptor-limited mobilities in DMS can be expressed by the straightforward equation σ (cm²/V·s) = (μ₀ (cm²/V·s) · ε₀ · N(D) · N(A))⁵, where μ₀ denotes the band connectivity in the absence of localized charge carriers, N(D) represents the acceptor density, and N(A) indicates the donor density. Consequently, for a given acceptor density, the acceptor-limited carrier mobility in diluted magnetic semiconductors is solely influenced by the donor density. This fundamental relationship should be recognized as a general characteristic of all IV-VI compounds containing both magnetic impurities and non-magnetic acceptors.",

It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model.

Our study indicates that FGR should not be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework. Furthermore, we propose an alternate perspective on the quantum dynamical phase shift, suggesting that QDPT may only pertain to classical systems and is absent in pure quantum limits. Our investigation reveals that QDPT can be viewed as a classical mechanics phenomenon emerging in quantum contexts when quantum interference effects are neglected. Through this alternative lens, we establish that scale invariance is a legitimate concept relevant to quantum dynamical phase shifts. Ultimately, our research sheds light on the quantum dynamical phase shift process in the classical limit and posits that scale invariance is not an intrinsic symmetry of quantum systems but an emergent characteristic that appears at larger distances in classical limits.",

To define the framework, we establish a five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell action utilizing the five-dimensional Minkowski spacetime metric along with a potential that produces a Z_2-symmetric deep brane solution. This framework leads to the emergence of equivalent five-dimensional Riemann metrics and four-dimensional induced metrics on the brane, as well as the requisite discontinuity in the fifth-dimensional component of the vector potential across the brane. By solving the five-dimensional equations of motion in this brane configuration, we calculate the Wightman function and vacuum densities for this setup. Our findings reveal that these densities remain nontrivial and exhibit dependence on both the spacetime and the fifth dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nontrivial nature of the vacuum densities has significant physical implications, specifically leading to a reduction in the additivity of power in the effective four-dimensional theory pertaining to the interaction between the brane and bulk fields.",

        "original_text": "Turbulent flows are often characterized by the assumption of locality, where the kinematics and dynamics are largely separable in space and time. In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady.

        "rewrite_text": "Turbulent flows are typically described by the principle of locality, which implies that the kinematics and dynamics can be treated as separable over space and time. Within this framework, fluid motion is broken down into distinct modes or eddies, which can be organized into quasi-regular structures like shears, jets, and fronts. For example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often form a hierarchical structure, where larger-scale features such as filaments and clusters emerge from lower-scale eddies. This phenomenon is frequently represented by power-law scaling, indicating that the height, speed, concentration, and heat of eddies at one scale can be related to those at a smaller scale through a specific scale factor. This multiscaling behavior implies a self-similar structure and has been observed with varying degrees of rigor across different physical systems. In our research, we conduct high-resolution direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence with a focus on the characteristics of multiscaling within the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as apparent as seen in related experimental studies and Eulerian grid-based simulations, yet it is still clearly present under a variety of flow conditions. We suggest that this is due to the evolving nature of multiscaling in compressible turbulence, where scaling interactions gradually diminish as modes increasingly differentiate over an expanding characteristic time scale. This phenomenon, referred to as intermittency, indicates a negative scaling exponent and consequently flatter multiscaling exponents. To support this idea, we develop a multifractal model that illustrates how the anticipated intermittency results in a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from a steady to an unsteady state. This provides a valuable framework for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows and has significant implications for the behavior of clusters in highly compressible turbulent flows, such as those found in atmospheric conditions and fusion plasma simulations.",

Furthermore, the upper limit WR contribution to the U-band magnitude of the whole galaxy is 2.2%, in contrast to the 8.3% derived from the global Wolf-Rayet content. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the late-type stellar content of the galaxy. Late-type stars dominate the light at optical wavelengths, and given the age-metallicity relation, they will exhibit a high fraction of early-type Wolf-Rayet stars.

This significant finding may be linked to a recent star formation event suggested by the detection of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the outskirts of the galaxy (Israel et al. 2014). However, a more thorough examination of the archived data reveals that the true upper limit on the global Wolf-Rayet activity in NGC 300 is, in fact, 7%. Moreover, the maximum contribution of Wolf-Rayet stars to the U-band magnitude of the entire galaxy is 2.2%, compared to the 8.3% derived from the global Wolf-Rayet abundance. This noticeable discrepancy can be attributed to the prevalence of late-type stars in the galaxy. Late-type stars dominate the optical light, and according to the age-metallicity relationship, they are expected to have a high proportion of early-type Wolf-Rayet stars. In fact, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing the observed and reconstructed optical colors of the galaxy yields a very low probability (P < 0.001) that the two samples originate from the same population.

Observational evidence suggests that these emissions likely originate near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole, although not all theoretical models account for the production of high-energy gamma rays. The emission patterns observed in blazars are complex. One widely accepted theory is the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which proposes that the magnetized central black hole drives the jet by extracting rotational energy from the black hole. Initially, this theory was thought to apply to weaker stellar magnetic fields; however, recent research indicates that the magnetic fields in blazars can be several orders of magnitude stronger. Another prevalent model is the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) mechanism, where synchrotron radiation interacts with its own photons, resulting in high-energy gamma-ray emissions. Blazars are known for their variability across all wavelengths, with changes occurring on very short timescales ranging from hours to days. These objects are powerful sources of radio, optical, and alpha radiation, with significant fluctuations in their electromagnetic emissions. Our research highlights that blazar jets are closely linked to the inner regions of their corresponding accretion disks. Jets appear to be launched from compact areas within these disks, and we find a strong correlation between the size of the disk scale length and the jet's power.

We observe quantum-measurement backaction with an ultracold atomic gas. In experiments with ultracold atoms, quantum mechanics allows for effects that would be reversible in classical physics, such as quantum backaction or measurement backaction. We perform a quantum process tomography of this unitary transform and show that our measurements reproduce the dynamics predicted by quantum mechanics. In general, quantum backaction occurs when a quantum system responds to a measurement. Quantum measurement theory describes the statistical relationships between quantum systems and measurements, and the act of measuring an observable affects the state of the system. Measurement backaction occurs when the measured observable has no mean value in the system’s initial state, and it is defined as the rate of change of the expected value of that observable. It can have a variety of forms. For example, if an operator is the observable of a quantum system, the measured system can become entangled with a meter system in a process called quantum entanglement, and backaction corresponds to how the measured system and meter system evolve together in time. Alternatively, if the operator is a parameter of a unitary transform, backaction could enable control and measurement of the parameters of unitary transforms, for example in quantum process tomography. Thus far, measurement backaction has only been observed in the presence of quantum entanglement or incoherent forces (e.g., gravity or the spin-force associated with magnetic fields). We demonstrate measurement backaction without entanglement or additional incoherent forces. Instead, we observe measurement backaction in an essentially pure system, without loss due to interactions with a large environment. The dynamics are reversible because our experiment operates near the quantum limit of few-atom systems.

        "rewrite_text": "In experiments involving ultracold atoms, quantum mechanics enables processes that, in classical physics, would be reversible, such as particle backaction and measurement backaction. We observe particle-measurement backaction in an ultracold atomic gas. By employing state-selection spin echoes, we identify atoms that have undergone a unitary transformation, linked to the observation of an operator without a mean value in the initial state of the process. We conduct quantum process tomography of this unitary transformation and find that our measurements align with the dynamics predicted by quantum mechanics. Our findings demonstrate detection backaction in a relatively straightforward framework, while satisfying the condition dB/dt ≥ |h|/τ, where dB represents the change in operator expectation values and τ is the typical time period of evolution. These findings could pave the way for innovative strategies in quantum control and precise measurement, with implications for quantum information and ultra-low light-noise measurements.\n\nIn general, quantum backaction occurs when a quantum system responds to a measurement. Quantum measurement theory addresses the statistical relationships between particle networks and measurements, indicating that the act of observing an observable influences the state of the system. Measurement backaction arises when the observable being measured lacks a mean value in the system's initial state and is quantified by the rate of change of the expected value of that observable. This backaction can manifest in various forms. For example, if an operator is the observable of a quantum system, the measured system may become entangled with a meter system in a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, where backaction describes the simultaneous evolution of the measured and meter systems over time. Alternatively, if the operator characterizes a parameter of a unitary transformation, backaction can facilitate the control and measurement of unitary transformation variables, as seen in quantum process tomography.\n\nTo date, measurement backaction has typically been observed only in contexts involving quantum entanglement or incoherent forces such as gravity or the spin-force associated with magnetic fields. However, we demonstrate measurement backaction without the need for entanglement or additional incoherent forces. Instead, we observe this phenomenon in a fundamentally simple system, without resorting to interactions with a large environment. The dynamics observed are reversible, as our experiment operates near the quantum limit typical of few-atom systems. Our results confirm measurement backaction in a straightforward context, with dB/dt ≥ |h|/τ, laying the groundwork for new avenues in quantum control and precision observation with potential applications in quantum information and ultra-low light-noise measurement.",

With the advent of recent transit missions like TESS and PLATO, the number of known exoplanets is anticipated to increase dramatically over the next decade. Most of these newly discovered planets are smaller and denser than Earth. Initial data from the Kepler mission suggested that many of these planets might have surfaces dominated by oceans. However, more detailed studies reveal that the presence of oceans on these planets remains uncertain. As our technology for detecting these worlds advances, astronomers are shifting their focus from examining surface conditions to understanding planetary climates. This suggests that in the future, we may be able to identify signs of life without necessarily detecting surface water. In essence, we could overlook many planets' characteristics. Research in dynamics plays a crucial role in the discovery and identification of exoplanets, and this field stands to gain significantly from cutting-edge advancements in computing, database analysis, and system identification.",

Our study of cohomology groups with local coefficients enables us to solve a famous conjecture of Bass on the rank of 2-cohomology groups of arithmetic groups. More precisely, we prove that if the corresponding Zariski closure of an arithmetic group has no simple factors of exceptional type, then the rank of 2-cohomology group of this arithmetic group is divisible by 2 and by the constant part of itsbsd fixer. We also discuss the combinatorics of these cohomology groups with local coefficients, in particular the effect of the schensted correspondence on these cohomology groups. Finally, we give a new realization of the canonical mixed building of the special orthogonal group as a non-symmetric space, which enables us to calculate the cohomology of the special orthogonal group using the corresponding result for the orthogonal group. As a consequence, we give an alternative proof that the special orthogonal group has cohomological dimension 2. In this paper, all representations are complex representations. The cohomology groups with local coefficients studied in this paper are all with integer coefficients. They can be studied with rational coefficients by a standard localization argument.

        "rewrite_text": "In astrophysics, moving black holes (BHs) produce observable signals across a wide range of lengths and times, from gamma rays to radio waves and laser frequencies. The most easily detected feature of a rotating black hole is the apparent elliptical variation in the light from a companion star that is situated behind it, as seen in celestial objects known as X-ray binaries. An X-ray binary consists of a normal star in a close binary system with a compact object, which can be either a black hole or a neutron star. This normal star is encircled by an accretion disk that captures material from the star’s winds and ejects stellar envelope debris into space, thereby creating the X-ray binary system. When the compact object is a rotating black hole, it exhibits frame dragging that disturbs its surface, producing a significant magnetic field. This magnetic field can alter the paths of particles in the accretion disk, causing them to precess. The influence of this magnetic force increases as the companion star gets closer to the black hole, allowing for potential measurements of the black hole's rotation rate.",

GCs are primarily old, self-gravitating systems of stars, thus providing a fossil record of the star formation events that gave rise to their constituent members.

We study the CGCSs of 13 massive, X-ray selected, optically dull galaxies (SDGs) with masses 1.3 - 4.5 x 10 11 M⊙, redshifts z = 0.02 - 0.33, and 13 - 105 Gyr of age using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/G band images. We find that 7 of these SDGs exhibit bimodal or multimodal GC systems. We compare our observational results with predictions of the classical early-major merger scenario, the delayed-merger scenario, and a novel merger-binary-spiral-component scenario. We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of pathways. At low redshift, these pathways included major mergers of comparable-sized galaxies, as well as more minor mergers and accretions. At high redshift, SDGs likely experienced more minor and major mergers, as well as purely dry minor mergers. However, we suggest that the late-stage mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies formed the dense central GC systems of the SDGs. The lack of strong rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-richness of these mergers. In this scenario, we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify 3 such galaxies. Using our spatially resolved color data, we show that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with the fraction of young stars increasing with distance from the center of the galaxy. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more extended than that of the old stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected distances within which half of the GC system’s GCs are found) and power-law slopes consistent with the predictions of recent major merger and purely dry minor merger scenarios, respectively.

At higher redshifts, these galaxies primarily underwent more minor and major mergers, including dry small mergers. Importantly, we propose that late-phase mergers involving gas-rich spiral clusters were responsible for developing the deep central GC systems observed in the SDGs. The low rotational support found in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-rich nature of these mergers. Consequently, we anticipate finding kinematic evidence of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with mainly diffuse GC systems, and we identify three such clusters. Through our spatially resolved color data, we discern that both the SDGs and their GCs consist of intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with a larger proportion of younger galaxies located farther from the galaxy centers. Furthermore, we find that the spatial distribution of GCs extends further than that of the older stars, and the GC systems exhibit truncation radii and power-law slopes consistent with predictions from recent significant collisions and purely dry small mergers.

As an explicit example, we show that a brane world in six space-time dimensions with an adjoint scalar field, where the scalar develops a VEV along the space time direction can be constructed. The model presented has no discrete symmetries, and is hence potentially realistic. It provides a self sustaining late-time cosmology that can explain the near epoch expansion of the universe, and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without the need for a cosmological inflationary period. Our model has a large number of arbitrary parameters, however we present a simple scenario in which all of these parameters are determined by a small number of parameters. The model is thus highly predictive. In particular, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane give constraints on the scale of compactification of the extra-dimensions, and the scale of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We show that current experimental bounds on these scales may be able to be achieved in the framework of our model. Additionally, we investigate the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. In particular, we show that after the spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be localized to a single 4D spatial location, while right-chiral anti- neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized over the extra-dimensions. Thus our model is not only realistic, but also solves the hot dark matter problem. Finally we discuss some of the cosmological implications of our work. In particular, we show that a 4D Friedmann equation can be obtained from our bulk theory. We present a scenario in which this dynamics, combined with the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe gives a natural explanation of the observed Hubble rate. The scenario we present is extremely simple, and has no free parameters. Moreover, it can potentially accommodate current observational constraints. This model is potentially testable in current and future experiments. Current experiments which may be able to test our model include MEG, PLANCK, and FOCUS.

Specifically, we present an example involving a six-dimensional brane world that features an adjoint scalar field, which acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) along the space-time direction. Notably, our model does not incorporate discrete symmetries, making it potentially realistic. It offers a sustainable mid-time cosmology that effectively describes the early development of the universe and generates small density inhomogeneities naturally, eliminating the need for cosmological inflation.\n\nAlthough our model includes numerous arbitrary parameters, we provide a straightforward scenario where most of these parameters can be determined by a limited set of values, enhancing its predictive capacity. The dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane impose constraints on the scale of extra-dimensional compactification and the extent of induced Lorentz violation. We highlight that current experimental constraints on these scales might be achievable within the context of our model.\n\nAdditionally, we explore the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. Notably, we find that post spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be confined to a specific 4D spatial region, whereas right-chiral anti-neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain spread across the extra dimensions. This aspect not only supports the realism of our model but also addresses the hot heavy matter problem. \n\nFinally, we discuss some cosmological implications of our work, demonstrating that a 4D Friedmann equation can be derived from our bulk dynamics.

        "rewrite_text": "Recent observational findings have established new constraints on the lengths of grand minima and maxima in solar activity, utilizing innovative techniques that analyze the extensive climate data preserved in ice cores. These findings suggest that the recent phase of diminished solar activity, referred to as the Maunder Minimum, is likely the longest gap of its kind in the past 1500 years. While grand maxima may share similarities with the emergence of active regions on the Sun during the mid-16th century, the exact causes remain uncertain. Although evidence for grand maxima is less robust than that for grand minima, the Maunder Minimum stands out as a distinctive event and will likely be remembered as one of the significant solar minima. In summary, the newly established observational limits indicate that the Maunder Minimum, characterized by its low solar activity, is probably the longest such interval recorded in the last 1500 years.",

However, there are a few channels which were found to be significantly impacted by choice of AOD inputs. These are the channels corresponding to AOD measured by IASI over Southern India, and the AOD measured by MISR over the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

In this work, we extend the aforementioned study by systematically investigating the effect of the quadrupolar moment of the black holes on the evolution of the Carter constant. We find that for binaries with small quadrupoles, the evolution is qualitatively similar to the case with no quadrupolar moment. However, for larger quadrupoles, the evolution is no longer continuous and can result in divergent values of the constant. We demonstrate that this behavior can be understood in terms of a simple geometric argument based on the impact parameter of the binary system, and we show that a critical value of the quadrupolar moment can be identified above which the evolution of the constant becomes qualitatively different.

Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most violent explosions in the universe. However, their study is complicated by their unpredictable, randomly directed beams, making it difficult to precisely localize them. Short-lived and beamed Gamma-Ray Bursts with known cosmological redshifts provide a crucial opportunity for studying the nature of the universe and its structure. A majority of long GRBs have been observed with the Swift satellite, which provides not only rapid localization but also a wealth of multi-wavelength data. We have examined the spectral evolution of 57 Swift long GRBs with known redshifts, finding that three distinctly different regimes exist. The first regime is characterized by a cooling break followed by a simple power law. Between two and four dissipation slopes are observed in this regime. The second regime, seen in 17 bursts, is characterized by an initial thermal component with a blackbody function or a non-thermal tail, followed by a single power law. In the third and final regime, seen in 30 bursts, no identifiable spectral break is present and the spectra are well fit by a single power law. The cosmological models that best describe the observed burst data are curveduploads and a finite universe, with a probability of 68.3% and 95.7% respectively. This result is surprising because standard candle models assume that all bursts have the same intrinsic luminosity, which would result in a single power law across all regimes.

The planets likely migrated from beyond the ice line, the distance from which ice materials can no longer warm via thermal excitation. It is suggested that this migration may have been driven by the forced oscillation of the disk. As the planets  cores grew via core accretion, the eccentricities and inclinations of the planets  orbits increased until, roughly 200 million years ago, the outer two planets collided with Mars. This created the current architecture for the giant planets, which is characterized by eccentric and inclined orbits. The migration and evolution of the giant planets likely has a profound effect on the structure of the current solar system. The dynamics of the giant planets in the gaseous disk are described. The analytic, 2D, hydrodynamical solutions of the Planet-Disk-Planet (PDP) system are presented. The migration of the giant planets from beyond the ice line is modeled.

This migration may have been influenced by forced oscillations within the disk. As the planets' cores developed through disk accretion, their orbital eccentricities and inclinations increased until, around 200 million years ago, the two innermost planets merged with Mars. This merger established the current arrangement of the giant planets, characterized by their erratic and tilted orbits. The migration and evolution of these giant planets likely have significant implications for the composition of the solar system as we know it today. The movements of the giant planets within the gaseous disk are analyzed, with the 2D hydrodynamical solutions derived from the Planet-Disk-Planet (PDP) framework presented.

In this Letter, we present a method for the synthesis of Taylor phase screens based on Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis functions. The approach combines ideas from optimisation and compensation. It consists of an optimisation problem that is non-convex and hard to solve in general, but can be approximated efficiently using an alternating method. The algorithm is validated on the synthesis of polynomial screens and an exponential screen. The synthesis of Taylor screens is a harder problem than synthesis of polynomial screens since it requires the synthesis of screens with rapidly changing phases. However, the proposed method synthesises Taylor screens with arbitrary smoothness and satisfies a natural physical constraint which guarantees the phase changes gradually. Balancing multiple objectives is a difficult problem in general. This is reflected by the fact that most heuristics for the synthesis of Taylor screens converge to a local optimum rather than the global optimum. In this Letter, we demonstrate how to tackle this problem using the KL method. We present a two-step method for initialisation and parameter identification. We show that the identified screens satisfy the physical constraints and have good approximation properties.

This standard approach, known as linear CV, has several shortcomings when characterizing electrochemical phase transitions. In some cases a phase change occurs but not complete reduction or oxidation of the system. This incomplete reduction or oxidation means that the system has not reached an equilibrium composition.

        "original_text": "Epsilon Aurigae (ι Aur) is an α2 CVn binary system with an F3 IV primary component and an K0 IV secondary component. Epsilon Aurigae is the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere sky, and it is almost always visible to the naked eye. The primary component is surrounded by a thick, hydrogen-filled envelope that causes it to be much cooler and less luminous than the Sun. As a result, Epsilon Aurigae has an unusual evolution on the H-R diagram - it is almost stationary along the main sequence but becomes a giant many centuries into the future. Historical estimates of the star s distance have varied considerably, from under 4 pc to over 14 pc, and recent high-precision parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite gave a distance of 11.65 pc. IUE spectra of the Epsilon Aurigae system showed Balmer emission from the primary star, although its spectrum was dominated by that of the secondary. The IUE data showed the presence of a thin cirrus-like hydrogen envelope around the primary star, at least 20 times less dense than the extended thick wind of the same star. The relative strength of the emission lines in the primary s spectrum varied periodically, with a period of 14.4 days - the rotation period of the primary star. Analysis of ultraviolet observations obtained with the Solar Mass Spectrometer on the Ulysses spacecraft suggested that Epsilon Aurigae was losing mass at a rate of about 10-9 to 10-8 kg s-1.

As a result , Epsilon Aurigae has an peculiar progression on the H - R diagram - it is almost stationary along the main sequence but forms a giant several centuries into the future .Historical accounts of the star s diameter have differed greatly , from under 4 pc to over 14 pc , and recent high - precision parallax observations from the Hipparcos satellite gave a distance of 11 . 65 pc . IUE spectra of the Epsilon Aurigae system showed Balmer radiation from the primary star , although its spectrum was dominated by that of the secondary .The IUE data showed the presence of a thin cirrus - like hydrogen core around the primary star , at least 20 twice less dense than the extended thick wind of the same star . The relative strength of the emission lines in the primary s spectrum differed continually , with a period of 14 . 4 hours - the rotation history of the primary star .Analysis of ultraviolet observations collected with the Solar Mass Spectrometer on the Ulysses spacecraft proposed that Epsilon Aurigae was lose mass at a rate of about 10 - 9 to 10 - 8 kilograms s - 1 .

        "rewrite_text": "Epsilon Aurigae (ι Aur) is an α2 Canum Venaticorum binary system featuring an F3 IV primary and a K0 IV secondary component. It ranks as the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere, usually visible to the naked eye. The primary star is enveloped by a thick layer of hydrogen, resulting in its lower temperature and luminosity compared to the Sun. Consequently, Epsilon Aurigae exhibits a unique path on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, remaining nearly stationary along the main sequence while destined to evolve into a giant several centuries from now. Historical measurements of the star's distance have varied widely, with estimates ranging from under 4 parsecs to over 14 parsecs, but recent high-precision parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite have established its distance at 11.65 parsecs. Spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) revealed Balmer emission lines from the primary star, although the spectrum was predominantly influenced by the secondary component. The IUE data also indicated a thin, cirrus-like hydrogen core surrounding the primary star, which is at least twenty times less dense than the star's extended, thick wind. The emission line strengths in the primary's spectrum varied continuously with a periodicity of 14.4 hours, indicating the rotation period of the primary star. Ultraviolet observations collected by the Solar Mass Spectrometer aboard the Ulysses spacecraft suggested that Epsilon Aurigae is losing mass at a rate of approximately 10^-9 to 10^-8 kilograms per second. This research also presents recent UBVJH photometry of Epsilon Aurigae, discussing the heat difference of the primary star as a function of wavelength and the profiles of the H Lambda emission lines. Additionally, calculations regarding the overall brightness of the system are provided for both the primary and secondary stars, along with discussions on the implications of the current mass-loss rate of the primary star and the evolutionary state of the system.",

The insulin-INSR complex is composed of two INSR polypeptides and two insulin molecules. The INSR proteins consist of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that includes the tyrosine kinase domain. The INSR extracellular domain binds insulin and INSR transmembrane domain transmits the signal from the INSR cell membrane to the intracellular domain, leading to INSR tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. The antiproliferative effect of MCRs may be explained by dephosphorylation of RB. This inhibition is caused by the absence of the insulin-INSR complex and decreased INSR tyrosine kinase activity.

        "original_text": "Spherically symmetric plasmas are an important and interesting general relativistic plasma system, which arise in, for example, collapsing stars, laboratory nuclear fusion experiments, and the early universe. The simplest spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system contains two independent functions of radial coordinate only. However, these can be reduced further to a single quadrature, allowing exact solutions to be obtained in several special cases. In general, the presence of the Maxwell field contributes one additional conserved charge, the masshair  of the solution. For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime. The resulting space-times describe either black holes with a gravitational mass, a scalar field hair, or naked singularities, depending on the choice of equations of state. In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by relating the system to a theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to a non-linear scalar field. We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties. In particular, we show how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair. Our approach has some similarity to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of some strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this respect, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above may be interpreted as a phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theory, with the black hole forming when the gauge theory approaches a large-$N$ limit in which gravity is strongly interacting, and the naked singularity forming when the gauge theory undergoes a large-$N$ transition to a low-energy weakly coupled plasma. This paper provides a rare example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system.

        "rewrite_text": "Spherically symmetric plasmas represent a crucial and fascinating category of relativistic plasma systems, found in contexts such as collapsing stars, experimental atomic fusion tests, and the early universe. The simplest model of a spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system comprises two independent functions that depend solely on the radial coordinate. However, this can be simplified to a single integral formulation, allowing for exact solutions across various specific scenarios. Generally, the inclusion of the Maxwell field introduces an additional conserved quantity, known as the masshair of the solution. Depending on the chosen equations of state for the plasma, explicit solutions can be derived for different regions of spacetime. These solutions may lead to spacetimes characterized as black holes with gravitational mass and scalar field hair, or as bare singularities, contingent upon the chosen equations of state. \n\nIn this paper, we introduce a comprehensive method to derive analytic solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell system involving spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by associating the system with a Newtonian gravity framework linked to a nonlinear scalar field. We employ a series expansion around the centers of symmetry of the solution, as well as several known analytic solutions to the nonlinear theory in Newtonian gravity, to construct the complete solution. Our general technique is applied to various specific scenarios, yielding new precise results for the Einstein-Maxwell system and an analysis of their features. Notably, we explore how the addition of a Maxwell field alters the potential outcomes of gravitational collapse, shifting from black hole formation without scalar hair to the emergence of naked singularities with scalar fur. \n\nOur findings bear some resemblance to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of certain strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this light, the gravitational collapse of charged matter mentioned earlier can be viewed as a phase transition within a strongly coupled gauge theory. Here, a dark hole emerges as the gauge theory approaches a large-N limit where gravity becomes strongly coupled, while a naked singularity arises when the gauge theory transitions to a low-energy, weakly coupled plasma. This research provides a unique example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system and illustrates how the introduction of a Maxwell field influences the potential outcomes of gravitational collapse, ranging from black holes without scalar hair to naked singularities with scalar hair. \n\nDate uploaded: March 25, 2020  \nDate accepted: February 20, 2023  \nAuthors: Matthew Chana, Duncan Haldeman, Valentina La Mouth, Reza Fathalian, Timothy Nguyen, Alexander Burkov, Andrew Mourey, Molly Pustilnik, Alexander Golubovich, Maria Tolkacheva, Elizabeth Mejia, Thorsten Ohl, Alexander Penzenko, Carl Radke, Stavros Anthrakis, Rahul Kumar",

Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs). Through carefully studying the SVD factors, we are able to identify the number of factors to equal the number of path points in a path, and thus ECC can be viewed as a dynamic lower dimensional Hankel matrix completion method. We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns. We show that ECC, with its single layer representation, is much more efficient and has much less parameters than existing 2D path curve approximation methods.

        "original_text": "One of the key questions in studies of star formation in the local universe is the overall star formation rate (SFR), which can be measured by the luminosity of ionizing radiation from young, hot stars. Such studies are typically performed at high redshifts, using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from young stars. Because the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type of stars and their age, the SFR can be measured by fitting the FUV emission with population synthesis models. This permits studies of star formation over the past 8-15 billion years, but the accuracy is limited by our poor knowledge of the SFH over much shorter timescales. Here we present an analysis of recent data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) that provides an accurate measurement of the SFR over the past 3 billion years, based on the luminosity of Ly-alpha radiation from young, cool stars. Unlike FUV radiation, this  visible  light varies with the instantaneous rate of star formation, making it a  flashing light  tracer of current SFR. Using our analysis techniques, we find a current SFR of 5.9 (± 2.3) × 10−3 solar masses per year in the local universe, 90% of which occurred in the past 3 Gyr. By comparing this with an older (13.7 billion year) estimate based on the evolution of the solar system s gold content, we conclude that the current SFR in the local universe is comparable to that of the last several billion years. These results provide crucial new constraints for models of star and galaxy formation in the universe.",

These studies are often conducted at high redshifts, utilizing rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from young galaxies. Since the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type and age of stars, researchers can estimate the SFR by fitting FUV radiation to models of star population production. This approach allows for the investigation of galaxy formation over the past 8 to 15 billion years, although accuracy is hindered by limited knowledge of the star formation history (SFH) over much longer time periods. In this study, we evaluate recent findings from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), which provides a precise measurement of the SFR over the last 3 billion years, using the luminosity of Ly-alpha radiation from young, cooler galaxies. Unlike FUV radiation, this prominent light correlates closely with the instantaneous rate of galaxy formation, making it an effective tracer for current SFR. Through our analytical techniques, we establish a current SFR of 5.9 (± 2.3) × 10−3 solar masses per year in the local universe, with 90% of this activity occurring over the last 3 billion years. By connecting this figure to a broader estimate of 13.7 billion years derived from the evolution of gold content in the solar system, we conclude that the present SFR in the local universe matches that of previous billion-year spans. These findings provide essential new constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution in the universe.",

The current leading survey to discover thousands of SNe Ia is the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Search (SNLS), which is targeting 7.5 deg2 area in distant Universe  1 . With the discovery of SNe Ia at such high redshifts, it will be possible to measure the dark energy properties with unprecedented precision. The LSST, which is projected to discover tens of thousands of SNe Ia in 10 square degrees by 2021, is expected to dramatically improve the measurement of the dark energy parameters  2, 3 . To achieve the optimal science return from these future surveys, it is essential to measure the structure growth rate from redshift 7.5 to 10 accurately. This requires much larger galaxy surveys in the near-infrared (NIR), and breaking the *visibility period gap with NIR galaxy surveys has become a high priority for SN cosmology research. In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation. We find that the uncertainty from this relation is smaller than 0.5% in wavenumber space, and the bispectrum information beyond the nonlinear scale can be exploited to further reduce the uncertainty to 0.1%. We forecast the uncertainty from using BOSS DR12 in the LSST full footprint by combining three regions with these NIR constraints, and find that the galaxy clustering measurements will achieve 1% precision at nonlinear scales (0.2% at one eighth of the nonlinear scale) in the dark energy analysis with only 25% more galaxies than the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. We also show that combining the BOSS DR12 clustering measurements with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the planned SPHERIC power spectrum measurement can significantly tighten the dark energy constraints, and the parameter errors can be decreased by a factor of two compared to using the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. The measurement from BOSS DR12 can be completed by 2021, and the full LSST NIR clustering measurement will be achieved in 2023.

This sympathetic cooling technique reduces the temperature of a particle ensemble through magnetic coupling between the atomic groups via dipole-dipole interactions. Our results indicate a sixfold reduction in Yb^+ temperature, corresponding to a sympathetic heating efficiency of 2.2(2) × 10^{-19} K/s, or 1.4(1) Hz, at 295(5) mK. Notably, our sympathetic cooling system does not require any special quantum properties of the Sr^+ ion, making it broadly applicable to various ion species.",

        "original_text": "Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are a heterogeneous population of objects, most of which are likely scattered disc objects (SDOs) that formed within the trans-Neptunian region of the Solar System. Their existence was predicted in 1664 by Johann-Heinrich Schroter, and the first such object was identified in 1801. TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems. Although many of these observed companions are likely remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, several systems with centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects are also clearly identified. Chaos-assisted capture (CAC) has been proposed as a mechanism to form these companions through resonant interactions with the giant planets, but recent theoretical work suggests that resonant capture may not be sufficient to explain the existence of so many multi-chained systems. In this paper, we propose another mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have been members of multiple systems: fission. We show that the sudden merger of two SDOs in a near-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO thanks to an instability that creates an additional gravitational torque. This mechanism, which we dub chaos-assisted fission, has the advantage of explaining the high observed fraction of binary TNOs without the need for planets to be responsible for their origin. We show that this dynamical process is likely to occur frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, especially during close encounters. By conducting a series of N-body simulations, we show that the instability that creates a new companion tends to occur for SDOs with a diameter of 100-150 km that are dynamically caught in an inward migration region between 35 and 40 au. For the conditions typically found in the trans-Neptunian region, the instability occurs more frequently for SDOs with an initial orbital radius of 30 au than for those with an initial orbital radius of 50 au. Finally, we show that two SDOs with initial semi-major axes of 300 au and 1.5 au could have been members of a binary system through this process.",

Their existence was first predicted by Johann-Heinrich Schroter in 1664, with the first TNO being documented in 1801. TNOs serve as crucial subjects for understanding planetary formation, as their current orbital configurations provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of the Solar System. Recent high-resolution observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have shown that a significant number of TNOs are actually part of compact multiple systems. This phenomenon is particularly prominent among larger TNOs, with around 15% of 2,499 objects over 50 km in diameter being multiple systems, and nearly one-third of TNOs 100 km or larger also falling into this category. While many of these companions are likely remnants of fragmented embryonic asteroids, numerous systems involving centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects have been clearly identified. Chaos-aided capture (CAC) has been suggested as a mechanism for the formation of these companions through resonant interactions with giant planets; however, recent theoretical research indicates that resonant capture alone may not adequately explain the prevalence of multiple-component systems. In this paper, we introduce an alternative mechanism—fission—by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have evolved into multiple components. We propose that the close-contact interaction of two SDOs can lead to the formation of a third SDO due to an instability that generates additional gravitational torque. This process, which we term chaos-aided fission, effectively accounts for the high prevalence of binary TNOs without attributing their origins to planetary influences. We argue that this dynamical process likely occurs frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, particularly during close encounters. Through a series of N-body simulations, we found that the instability leading to the emergence of a new sister body is more common among SDOs with diameters between 100 and 150 kilometers, especially those caught in inward-moving orbits between 35 and 40 AU. Under typical conditions in the trans-Neptunian region, this instability occurs more often for SDOs with initial orbital radii of 30 AU compared to those beginning at 50 AU. Lastly, our findings suggest that two SDOs with initial semi-major axes of 300 AU and 1.5 AU might have formed a binary system through this fission process.",

By utilizing a parameterized approach to transition from a paramagnetic to a superconducting (SC) state, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of the dynamics of the array under both the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. Our findings reveal that when subjected to a uniform magnetic field, the system experiences periodic phases akin to Anderson localization, alternating between metallic and insulating states, mirroring the dynamics of a one-dimensional single JW. In contrast, when the magnetic field is spatially configured in the shape of a ring, the system transitions from an insulating state to a metallic one. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms of this behavior and formulates a phenomenological theory that more accurately represents the dynamics in both extreme scenarios.

Numerous generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have emerged since its inception. One notable extension is the correlated perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert and later enhanced by Freeman and Subbaswamy. This method allows orbital adjustments during iterations, maintaining the energy expression as a functional of orbitals. However, the functional is approximated as the sum of the Hartree energy and a Fock energy defined as a functional of the orbitals. Similarly, variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT), introduced by Edward and developed by Hyberts and Wood, also presents the energy as a functional of orbitals but differs from CPHF in its approximation methods. In VIPT, the energy is expressed as a combination of Hartree energy and a free-energy functional that incorporates perturbation theory to a specific order. Another relevant extension is variational perturbation theory (VPT), which employs a comparable functional but minimizes it concerning the orbitals instead of treating them as fixed parameters. All these extensions uphold the principle that the system's energy is framed as a functional of the orbitals. This paper aims to trace the evolution of the Hartree-Fock SCF method and its various generalizations over recent decades. We start with an in-depth examination of the original method, detailing the key approximations involved in its formulation. Subsequently, we discuss various adaptations of the method, along with developments of related concepts. For example, we elucidate the CPHF method and its extensions, establishing their connections to the Hartree-Fock framework. Lastly, we address certain challenges faced by the Hartree-Fock SCF method and its generalizations, particularly the need for efficient parallel computational strategies. Overall, this review serves as a platform for researchers engaged in quantum chemistry and theoretical physics, synthesizing a wealth of information from existing literature.",

The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics. Here is an excerpt from the paper: A remarkable property of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical mechanisms. For example, if two random vectors are statistically independent, then their entropies add. More generally, if statistical mechanisms transform into , their entropies increase. The entropy power inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) entropy power inequality are fundamental and well known results in information theory. The former states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the sum of the entropies of its components, while the latter states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the entropy of its mean. Both these inequalities hold for any random vectors. Here we present information-theoretic proofs of the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities.

These inequalities are relevant to multivariate dependence theories and have potential applications in areas such as mathematics, information theory, and statistics. \n\nNotably, one unique aspect of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical operations. For example, when two random vectors are statistically independent, their entropies combine additively. More broadly, as statistical mechanisms shift, the entropies tend to increase. The entropy energy inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate inequality (ER) are both fundamental and well-known in information theory. The EPI asserts that the entropy of a random matrix cannot exceed the sum of the entropies of its individual components, while the ER states that the entropy of a random matrix is greater than the entropy of its mean. Both inequalities are applicable to any random vectors. \n\nIn this work, we provide data-theoretic proofs for the entropy energy and entropy rate inequalities. Our investigation begins with the information inequality (FI), which establishes a tighter bound on mutual information.

        "original_text": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme is one of the most important and widely used methods in theoretical chemistry and quantum physics to solve the Schrödinger equation for the system with Coulomb potential. The efficiency of KS scheme relies on the choice of the approximate electron-electron interaction. For strong interaction, one has to use more elaborate KS-potential, which is numerically expensive. One of the efficient and low-cost approximations for the KS potential is the so-called exact exchange (EX) potential. This potential is constructed as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to the electron density. The density obtained from the KS equations with the EX potential as a part of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is very close to the actual one. However, the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS-potential yields a very large gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not correspond to the experimentally observed excitability of the systems. This discrepancy is referred to as the paradox of the correlated electrons. It was shown by Vydrov and Scuseria in 2008 that the gap in the excitation spectrum of the KS system with the EX potential can be made closer to the experimental one by introducing an artificial dependence of the potential on density, which they called the non-local dependence (NLD). In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term. The non-local term appears due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron density. We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into account. We present the KS equations with the new XC potential and prove that the solutions of the equations coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS potential. This solution eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the correlated electron systems described by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential.",

In this research we prove that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a outcome of the fact that it is found as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non - local term .The non - local term becomes due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron distribution . We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into consideration .We introduce the KS coefficients with the new XC potential and assume that the answers of the coefficients coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS solution with the EX potential as the KS potential . This solving eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the interacting ion configurations presented by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential .",
        "rewrite_text": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme is a fundamental and widely employed method in computational chemistry and quantum science for addressing the Schrödinger equation in systems with Coulomb potential. The effectiveness of the KS scheme hinges on how accurately it approximates electron-electron interactions. In cases of strong coupling, a more complex KS potential is required, which can be computationally intensive. A more efficient and cost-effective approximation for the KS potential is the exact exchange (EX) potential, which is derived as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to electron density. When using the KS coefficients with the EX potential incorporated into the exchange-correlation (XC) potential, the resulting density closely resembles the actual electron density. However, employing the EX potential as the KS potential leads to a significant gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not align with the excitability observed in experiments—this discrepancy is known as the paradox of interacting electrons. In 2008, Vydrov and Scuseria demonstrated that introducing a synthetic density-dependent potential, termed non-local dependence (NLD), can reduce the gap in the KS excitation spectrum, bringing it closer to empirical values. Our research confirms that the presence of NLD in the KS potential arises from the solution of the KS equations when the XC potential includes a non-local term, which is a consequence of the Fock operator's dependence on electron distribution. We derive a formula for the NLD term that encapsulates this notion. By incorporating new XC potentials into the KS coefficients, we assume that the results obtained will align with those from previous potentials as well as with the KS solution that utilized the EX potential. This method successfully closes the gap in the excitation spectrum and aligns the configurations of interacting ions presented by the KS scheme with the exact exchange potential and the Fock operator while maintaining a reasonable density dependence on the Coulomb potential.",

Specifically, we demonstrate that the Bohmian position of a test particle acts as a local constant of motion for any nontrivial entangled continuous or constant superposition of product states. We provide an explicit formula for the local de Broglie-Bohm wave in relation to the original wavefunction and apply this finding to the delocalized solutions of the one-dimensional quantum several-body dynamical Yang-Lee model, which includes the 1D Bose gas, the 1D hard-core gas, and the spin-1/2 XX model.

We then prove that a similar result holds for the continuous limit of this discretized wavefunction. The verification process reveals that the Bohmian position remains a constant of motion for any wavefunction that is a product state formed from the original wavefunction and its complex conjugate.

This is in contrast to the vapour, where the global minimum has two strong NH...O hydrogen bonds, leading to the resonance form.

The linewidth is used to calculate the vibrational lifetime of the nitrous oxide solution molecules.

The nitrous oxide behavior in solution aligns well with previous gas phase studies, utilizing a combination of IR spectral analysis methods.

In particular, we focus on the supercurrent flowing in the junction, which is generated by a non-equilibrium pairing mechanism.

Historically, it was thought that these outflows were powered solely by energy lost by stretching of the GRB jet, which launches at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a viable model for the observed diversity of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During a GRB, the surface of the magnetar may emit gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, which could power a cosmological population of highly-relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds. While some baryonic-wind models produce mildly-relativistic jets that could account for some of the diversity of long-duration GRBs, these models tend to over-predict the amount of energy that can be extracted from the central NS. We demonstrate that a better coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows via neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux can solve this problem. In particular, we consider a combination of a baryonic wind from a magnetar with a mildly-relativistic jet, and find that the total energy coupled to the winds can account for the majority of long GRBs.

        "rewrite_text": "Magnetar starquakes can release high-energy photons through a phenomenon known as main engine disk instability, and the dipole radiation or winds produced by a rapidly spinning magnetar can create collimated outflows during gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Traditionally, it has been believed that these outflows were exclusively driven by energy released from the expanding GRB jet, which travels at nearly light speed. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be fueled by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that most known GRB central engines are rapidly spinning down as a result of this mechanism. If the energy associated with these storms is substantial, the outflow can become mildly relativistic (with a Gamma greater than 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets offers a plausible explanation for the observed variety of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly spinning neutron star (NS), particularly a magnetar, is widely regarded as the main engine behind short-duration GRBs. During a GRB event, the magnetar's surface may emit gravitational waves (GW), which could power a population of highly relativistic jets, alongside baryonic winds. Although some baryonic wind models succeed in explaining aspects of short-duration GRBs, they often overestimate the amount of power that can be drawn from the neutron star. We propose that enhanced coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows via mechanisms like neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux could resolve this issue. Specifically, our study focuses on the interaction between baryonic winds from a magnetar and mildly relativistic jets, revealing that the energy transferred to the winds could account for the majority of short GRBs. Ultimately, we argue that a model incorporating both a baryonic wind component and a jet remains viable for explaining the long-duration GRB phenomenon.",

Historically, SPMs have been characterized with binary classification approaches, whereby proteins are classified as either stable or unstable based on some SPM-specific stability metric. While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult.

In essence, this method first characterizes the wild-type protein with a high-level method like molecular mechanics energy decomposition analysis (MM-EDA). For each SPM, the method then decomposes the total energy difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins into residue-level contributions. This method allows us to capture site-specific contributions of the mutant and wild-type proteins, and therefore may be a better tool for understanding the stability impacts of SPMs. We tested this paradigm on the recently published CO-BRASS data set (1).

We find that at all masses, DM halos can be cleanly separated into two primary structural components: a relatively smoothly distributed  central  region and a more clumpy  substructure  component which comprises a distinct secondary distribution having an asymptotic power-law slope of -3. The fraction of substructure within a halo, and the power-law slope of its structural distribution, are both significantly correlated with the halo s maximum identified gravitational attraction: the more substructure a halo has, the stronger its central gravitational pull. We refer to these two distinct structural components as the  core  and  fossil  distributions, respectively, and suggest that fossil groups, comprising a halo with a significant fraction of central substructure, may be identified by an algorithm combining the FOF halo-finder with the inverse of this power-law slope.

We identify DM halos within this extensive dataset using a method that combines friends-of-friends (FOF) algorithms with a high-order multivariate filter, and we analyze their internal structure by examining the longitudinal distribution of their DM and substructure elements—both stellar and gaseous.

The latter exhibits a primary distribution characterized by an asymptotic power-law slope of -3. Notably, the amount of substructure within a halo, as well as the power-law slope of its structural distribution, is significantly correlated with the halo's maximum identified gravitational pull; thus, halos with greater substructure tend to possess stronger central gravitational attraction.

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",

This discussion illustrates how, despite their long-standing introduction, the Lorentz transformations provide valuable insights for understanding mathematics and mechanics. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between first- and second-order equations in physics. The essay further explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations, revealing that they can be derived from more general principles, specifically the idea that certain mechanical laws remain invariant over time.

The article then presents a scenario from special relativity involving a person measuring the speed of light from two different inertial frames of reference. It shows that to fully understand this situation, both the spatial and temporal aspects of the Lorentz transformations must be considered because the speed of light depends on both. In this example, the temporal aspect can be understood as a change in reference frame, affecting how the clocks in different frames tick relative to one another. The authors conclude that by defining the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can also determine the corresponding temporal changes.

A strong R-matrix is a non-linear operator that, together with a related linear operator (the S-matrix), yields an associative product that defines a finite-dimensional non-commutative ring with unity, known as a finite braided commutative algebra (FBCA). In this work we describe computation of R-matrices for eight binary QC codes using the RIME framework. We use the abelian setting where the S-matrix is a diagonal matrix to compute R-matrices that are also diagonal, and give examples of non-abelian R-matrices for the same codes. We discuss how the R-matrices interact with RIME to establish ideal lattices for each of the codes. The eight codes we study are optimal two-level codes, two-level extended Hamming codes, and five four-level codes commonly used in surface-code quantum computing. Our computed R-matrices have many nice properties, including compatibility with the abelian setting and simple structure when viewed as a lattice over the real numbers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. In particular, we describe the case where the R-matrix is a real diagonal matrix as a families of real numbers (depending on several parameters) where each number occurs with multiplicity one and each occurs exactly twice. We also show how to compute R-matrices corresponding to non-abelian structures when the S-matrix is diagonal. The RIME framework for computing R-matrices in the abelian setting makes use of an appropriately modified quantum chess problem, the Hamilton Pfaffian QC-polynomial. In particular, each symmetry of the chess problem corresponds to a permutation matrix in the R-matrix, and these permutations satisfy a precise lattice-theoretical restriction. In the non-abelian case, no analogous check for R-matrix structure appears to be known, so alternative techniques must be used to establish non-abelian R-matrices. In this work, we describe a non-abelian RIME framework that similarly uses a modified Hamilton Pfaffian but with the permutations no longer required to satisfy a lattice-theoretical restriction. Instead, an ad-hoc method for establishing non-abelianity is used. Finally, we present a few experiments using RIME to establish security of communication over common communication channels (such as WiFi or cell-phone networks).

        "rewrite_text": "The velocity of the universe remains largely uncertain. One widely discussed explanation is dark energy, which can be described either as a cosmological constant or as a dynamic form known as quintessence. Currently available data does not allow us to differentiate between these two scenarios. However, with sufficient information about the universe's evolution, discrimination becomes feasible. We focus on linear cosmological perturbations, specifically considering the case of a constant equation of state, W = 0. Under these conditions, if W remains constant and is significantly different from -1 for over 50% of the universe's age, it becomes relatively straightforward to distinguish between the two scenarios. On the other hand, if the equation of state is not constant, or if it is constant but lacks precision, or if it does not approach -1 adequately, discrimination is impossible. Notably, if W varies significantly but remains close to -1, it is still possible to distinguish between the two scenarios. Our findings suggest that differentiation between a cosmological constant and quintessence is more straightforward when W is constant and markedly different from -1. Importantly, these results do not confirm that dark energy is definitively a cosmological constant or quintessence; rather, they impose certain constraints on these hypotheses. Generally, if the behaviors of the two dark energy scenarios are very similar, distinguishing between them becomes impractical. Nonetheless, assuming a constant equation of state for dark energy may allow us to differentiate between these two models using current data. Future research with improved data precision would be valuable to assess the validity of this assumption.

This system was first identified by Dieterich et al. (2020) as part of a large transit search utilizing data from the Dark Energy Camera, and the findings were shared on the arXiv preprint server. While initially classified as a single-lined spectroscopic binary—commonly indicative of a planetary system—UScoJ1609-2156 likely comprises at least three components, two of which are visible to the naked eye. The components UScoJ1609A and B are M-dwarf stars in a close hierarchical orbit with orbital periods of around one day, and their apsidal orientation results in a total transit duration of about six hours. The third component, UScoJ1609-2156C, is a broader companion located at a projected separation of approximately 14.7 arcseconds (around 400 AU) and is the most distant component that can be studied for atmospheric analysis with current technology. I formally discussed UScoJ1609-2156 during a joint conference of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP) held in Seattle, Washington, from April 9-11, 2020. In my presentation, I will provide an overview of the discovery and analysis of UScoJ1609-2156, along with recent methods for characterizing and detecting multi-planet systems. Lastly, I will explore the potential for atmospheric detection of UScoJ1609-2156C and discuss the broader prospects for characterizing low-mass companions to solar-type stars.",

In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",

        "rewrite_text": "Massive objects at high redshift (z ~ 2) are believed to contribute to the formation of the large galaxies observed in the local universe. In this study, we leverage the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to examine the structural processes occurring in these large galaxies during this early epoch. Our findings indicate that the primary mode of galaxy formation at these redshifts involves quiescent, dry merging, challenging the prevailing assumptions derived from studies of local galaxies. More specifically, we observe a consistent increase in the specific star formation rate of large galaxies from z = 2 to the present, alongside a decline in the ratio of recent to past star formation rates and in galaxy size. We propose that these trends cannot be easily explained by a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present without altering their developmental trajectory. Rather, we suggest that the processes determining the star formation rates in these massive galaxies at high redshift differ significantly from those affecting present-day stars. Although this formation mode is inefficient, it plays a crucial role in the development of the large clusters we observe in the local universe. Furthermore, this growth is non-linear, with massive galaxies expanding through both the accretion of smaller companions and smooth (wet) mergers, with each contributing similarly to galactic growth. This mechanism of dry merging accounts for the known size evolution of large galaxies and helps clarify the correlation between galaxy formation and structure: as galaxies begin to grow through dry merging, the formation of their brightest central regions occurs at a faster pace than the outskirts. Our data may also address longstanding questions regarding the early growth of large galaxies. In particular, our results suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies primarily grew through dry merging over much of their existence, which could account for the observed relationships between different aspects of galaxy formation. Additionally, we argue that massive galaxies at high redshift were not necessarily experiencing a downsizing in star formation, as might be inferred from reports of intense star formation in some high-redshift galaxies. Instead, we posit that the observed variations in the physical processes and rates of galaxy formation between contemporary large galaxies and their counterparts at high redshift may be influenced by the much longer timescales since the peak of past dry merging activity. While the specifics of these changes remain debated, our findings highlight the significance of early growth through dry merging in understanding the large galaxy structures we observe in the present-day universe.",
