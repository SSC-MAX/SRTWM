We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

        "rewrite_text": "The observed spectra of black holes may comprise multiple components, one of which is the thermal aspect. It has been established that a string theory dual to this system is a gas of strings and particles, referred to as fuzzballs. This suggests that the evaporation of white holes does not merely result in a black hole with a specific temperature, but rather in a fuzzy black hole made up of various non-commutative fragments. Specifically, we propose that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi variable for fuzzballs is given by the string statistical constant, |b| = 2π/3. We present compelling circumstantial evidence for this assertion by deriving the semiclassical maximum of state degeneracy (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of the lowest-lying states (greybody factors) from fundamental principles in string theory. Our findings indicate that the spectrum and symmetries of these low-lying states align well with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is connected to the thermal state through a Penrose process. Additionally, we demonstrate that the entropy of small black holes can be accounted for by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, suggesting that the decay of a small black hole involves the fission of a larger fuzzball. Our results confirm fuzzballs as the suitable structures within string theory that replicate the conventional description of black holes. Furthermore, since the fuzzball partition function is anticipated to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/|b|, where |b| is the Barbero-Immirzi constant, we also establish |b| as a physical observable within string theory.",

However, computing these models can be quite complex, primarily due to the reliance on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for approximating the posterior distribution. Recently, the variational inference (VI) algorithm has been introduced and shown to effectively compute the approximate posterior distribution in Bayesian deformer models. In this paper, we present a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) based on the VI algorithm to improve computational efficiency. Our approach is initially formulated within a general Bayesian deformable framework and subsequently applied to specific Bayesian deformer models for validation. Our findings from both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our method outperforms the previous VI approach and is on par with the leading MCMC techniques in terms of efficiency for Bayesian deformer models.

In this work, we introduce a new technique to study NESSs in quantum lattice systems that is particularly well suited to application to large systems and sparse matrices. Our method, the solution of the matrix product operator (MPO) equations of motion, is built upon a two-fold expansion: an expansion in the size of the underlying matrix product state (MPS) representation and an expansion in Chebyshev polynomials. This allows us to capture dynamics in large, complex quantum systems that are represented by very sparse matrices. We apply our technique to the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a paradigmatic model of quantum phase transitions. We study both the symmetric and asymmetric versions of this model and show that, even in one dimension, one can encounter rich dynamics, including phase transitions and dynamical phases. We also study the hard-core bosons on the square lattice using a quantum simulator and find excellent agreement between our results and those from exact diagonalization. Finally, we use this approach to study the solution of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model at finite temperature. We find, contrary to previous conjectures, that this model does not exhibit a phase with broken symmetries.

One of the most popular models that has enjoyed great success in reproducing the observed particle spectrum is the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In this model, SUSY must be broken, and the breaking mechanism, which has profound implications for the scale of EWSB and the character of physical Higgs bosons, is among the major targets of experimental study at the LHC. The MSSM Higgs sector comprises two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons, Hplus and Hminus. A crucial test of this model is the determination of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the observed Higgs bosons. The large sparticle masses predicted by the mSUGRA model motivate a particular benchmark region known as the focus point region, which exhibits relatively light Higgs bosons, in particular a 126 GeV Higgs boson. The observation of a Higgs boson with these characteristics would be a strong indication of supersymmetry and would greatly strengthen the case for this mysterious energy scale. In this letter, we present the prospects for the detection and measurement of this 126 GeV Higgs boson at the 14 TeV LHC, including both direct reconstruction in the di-Higgs plus final state and more prosaic measurements based on the observation of its decay products. We examine bothgg production via gluon fusion and VBF, the t-, W-, and Z-associated production modes, and the associated production with bottom quarks or gluons. We focus on analyses performed by the ATLAS experiment and make use of 13 TeV data with an expected 15-20 fb-1 of total LHC luminosity.

The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is one of the most widely accepted theories that successfully replicates the observed particle spectrum.

These GeMn columns were synthesized through chemical vapor deposition on Ge (100) substrates at a temperature of 300 °C, with an estimated pillar size of approximately 30 nm. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging indicates that the GeMn columns form through the accumulation of small grains at the tips of larger ones. Tomographic analysis via transmission electron microscopy reveals that these smaller grains are enriched in manganese compared to the substrate structure. The GeMn structure exhibits significant variation across the columns. Observations from extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy indicate that the GeMn columns contain considerable amounts of interstitial manganese atoms, which likely play a crucial role in the ferromagnetic properties of the material. The self-organization process during the growth of the GeMn columns allows for the customization of their structure and shape, which has a profound impact on the magnetic characteristics of the metal.

Furthermore, the presence of limit-cycle oscillations is consistently observed in the truncated system. The truncation dimension influences the duration of the chaotic orbit's transient phase; a higher truncation dimension results in a longer transient turbulent orbit, allowing for the observation of more dynamic interactions. For example, if the transient turbulent orbit is sufficiently long, we can easily detect intermittency and bifurcations from toroidal to odd attractors.

Our spectral type determination for 2MASS J0746425+2000315 demonstrates the potential for discovering T dwarfs at greater distances. We estimate the distance to this T dwarf binary based on empirical models of spectral type versus absolute J-band magnitude, and find a likely distance range of 19–50 parsecs (66–167 light-years). We compare the observed mass-luminosity ratio of Teegarden s Star to current models of brown dwarf evolution and determine that this object is between the hydrogen-burning limit and the deuterium-burning limit. Future observations of Teegarden s Star will allow for further testing of these models, as well as the models  ability to predict the luminosities of ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages. Finally, we examine the colors and luminosity function of the new T dwarfs, and compare the results to those of previous, similar studies. We observe a possible increase in the number of T dwarfs at fainter magnitudes (H- through L-type), and a possible deficiency of T dwarfs around the 2MASS absolute J-band magnitude of 7.5. However, due to the small number of T dwarfs in the sample and the large photometric errors at the fainter end of the luminosity function, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Our investigation involves fitting 2MASS Point Source Catalog (PSC) data to WISE full-frame observations, leading to the compilation of a new table featuring 22 T dwarf neighbors. Among the newly discovered T dwarfs are Teegarden's Star and Doornos Star, which rank as the 23rd and 24th closest stars to Earth, respectively, along with the nearest known T dwarf binary, 2MASS J0746425 + 2000315. We provide spectral classifications and photometric data for all 22 newly identified T dwarfs, comparing their spectral types and colors with those of previously recognized T dwarfs. Our spectral classification for 2MASS J0746425 + 2000315 suggests potential for locating T dwarfs at greater distances. We estimate the distance to this T dwarf binary using empirical relationships between spectral type and absolute J-band magnitude, yielding a probable distance range of 19 to 50 parsecs (66 to 167 light-years). We connect the known mass-luminosity relationship of Teegarden's Star to recent insights on brown dwarf evolution, concluding that it lies between the hydrogen-burning and deuterium-burning thresholds. Future observations of Teegarden's Star will facilitate further exploration of these models, as well as those predicting the luminosities of ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages. Additionally, we analyze the colors and luminosity function of the new T dwarfs, relating our findings to previous studies. We observe a potential shift in the proportion of T dwarfs at fainter magnitudes (H- through L-class) and a possible scarcity of T dwarfs near the 2MASS absolute J-band magnitude of 7.5. However, due to the limited number of T dwarfs in our sample and significant photometric uncertainties at the fainter end of the luminosity function, these findings should be approached with caution. We expect this research to enhance existing spectroscopic and photometric dwarf catalogs and serve as a valuable resource for future studies of ultracool dwarfs.",

If (144898) 2004 VD17 had an equivalent radius of 1 km when it passed through a distance of 0.0435 AU from Earth, it would have a probability of approximately 7.2 × 10−13 of making a close approach to the Earth and a 0.033% chance of impact. Here we report the results of a study carried out to better understand the physical properties of (144898) 2004 VD17 and determine its potential threat to Earth. To achieve this, observations of 2004 VD17 were acquired over two days using the Siding Springs Observatory, complemented by Earth-based radar observations from the Arecibo and Goldstone Observatories and high-resolution visual observations from the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory (UAO). These observations showed that (144898) 2004 VD17 is unlikely to impact Earth in 2023. Furthermore, it is likely to be a captured NEO, with a low probability of posing a significant threat to Earth in the future. Observations of (144898) 2004 VD17 indicate that it is most likely a captured asteroid whose orbit becomes unstable and cross that of Earth every few hundred years. The identification of 2004 VD17 only twelve months prior to its next near-Earth pass in 2023 suggests that it may not be stable on current orbit. This research highlights the utility of wide area surveys in the discovery of potentially hazardous objects. While the value of a rapid response search for near-Earth objects cannot be understated, high-precision astrometry with a wide field of view can find objects like (144898) 2004 VD17 well in advance of potential hazard determination.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion.

By analyzing the light spectrum emitted by the supernova, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of its progenitor, revealing evidence of a stellar wind from the progenitor's rapidly expanding main sequence phase or a core-collapse event. Despite extensive research over the years, the identity of the most common progenitor for core-collapse supernovae remains a topic of debate, with massive main-sequence stars (approximately 8 solar masses) implicated in certain supernova subtypes. One notable subtype, Type Ia, has been extensively studied in cosmology and is linked to a debated progenitor type: brown dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion star. Additionally, luminous blue variables (LBVs), which are the ancestors of these massive stars, have been proposed as a second, less understood category of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts, which prevent further evolution into a compact object, are generally attributed to either increased mass transfer from a binary companion or thermonuclear explosions occurring on the star's surface. The region surrounding supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporary LBV and another supernova (1988Z) resembling SN 1987A, presenting an intriguing coincidence that may suggest LBV outbursts could be a mechanism for certain supernova types.

Simulations suggest that a rare LBV collapse, occurring about 200 days prior to the supernova, likely marked the end of its rapid evolution into a compact body. Furthermore, the recent discovery of the remnant from an LBV explosion, approximately 30 to 60 days after the outburst, may lend support to the idea that LBV explosions can trigger supernovae.

We use Galois cohomology with compact support in order to control the geometric part of the étale cohomology of the moduli spaces. By combining our results with previous work of Kevin Hutchinson, we deduce that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of surfaces. Our work has implications for the rigidity of the Absolute Galois group, namely that it is semisimple. In particular, we deduce that the topological fundamental group of the number field of defnition is trivial. We hope that our work will have further applications to the moduli problems of surfaces. For example, we use our results to deduce that the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of surfaces is nef and big, and so gives rise to a semi-stable family of curves. Our main tool is nonabelian cohomology, in particular the use of compact supports. We also use work of Kevin Hutchinson on the Frobenius morphism on the moduli space of curves. Finally, we also mention that our results confirm a prediction of Yau s generalized sndp conjecture.

We employ Galois cohomology with compact support to enhance the geometric aspects of the étale cohomology of these moduli spaces. By integrating our results with prior work by Kevin Hutchinson, we establish that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of surfaces. Our research has significant implications for the rigidity of the Absolute Galois group, particularly indicating that it is semisimple. Specifically, we conclude that the topological fundamental group of the defining number field is trivial. We anticipate that our findings will further contribute to the study of moduli problems related to surfaces. For example, we utilize our results to show that the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of surfaces is nef and huge, thereby leading to a semi-stable family of curves. Our primary method involves nonabelian cohomology, particularly the use of compact supports. Additionally, we incorporate Kevin Hutchinson's work on the Frobenius morphism within the moduli space of curves.

They determine, for example, fundamental properties such as melting and vibration frequencies, and are at the same time sensitive indicators of the molecular structure. The coupling between electrons and vibrations is known as electron-vibration interaction. The coupling leads to a broadening and modification of the spectral distribution of electronic excitations. The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Here, we present the first calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant in covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion. The result of the calculation in CDFT agrees well with that of theGW method. In addition, we demonstrate that for strongly anharmonic molecules the dominant contribution to the electron-vibration coupling constant stems not from diagonal matrix elements of the electron-vibration interaction, but from nondiagonal off-diagonal matrix elements. These off-diagonal matrix elements are induced by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface. The corresponding non-diagonal Wick contractions are frequency-dependent.

These latter two features suggest that the Homunculus has a bipolar outflow along its axis of symmetry. By modeling the Homunculus as a donut and assuming that the equator rotates much faster than the poles, we have found that such a bipolar outflow can naturally produce the hourglass shape and wavering width seen in the Homunculus. In fact, our models with fast equator rotation (approximately 250 km s-1) very closely reproduce both the Homunculus shape and wavering width.

Compared to the local luminous quasars, these highest-redshift objects have extremely high space density, and therefore are excellent tools with which to investigate the growth of supermassive black holes and their host bulges and galaxies. We find that the highest-redshift quasars have similar X-ray properties to those at low redshift, but with broad EWs and X-ray luminosities that are a factor of ~10 higher. This emission is most plausibly interpreted as thermal coronal gas in the host galaxies with broad emission lines. When compared to a radio-loud control sample matched in X-ray luminosity, the quasars have significantly enhanced radio emission, although not as much as predicted by models in which the powerful radiation emitted by the quasar promotes gas into a hot, kpc-scale torus. The small difference in radio emission may indicate that, at high redshift, quasars have less obscured nuclei than locally. We suggest that this may be due to the brighter cosmic background at high redshift, which can penetrate more easily through a putative torus.

This emission is most likely attributed to heated coronal gas within the host galaxies, accompanied by broad absorption lines.

The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

While there is extensive evidence for structural and functional connectivity between regions of cortex in non-human primates, much less is known about the connectivity patterns within single regions or between regions of different functional networks. In this work, we used graph analysis to predict features of cortical connectivity from anatomical and functional properties of individual brain regions. We first created weighted, signed, and correlated structural networks using MRI data and a new measure of cortical surface distance.

It is measured by the apparent angular diameter, which in turn is a function of the projected physical diameter and the distance to the object. Planets, gas giants, and other large asteroids typically have visible angular diameters less than 1 arc-second, corresponding to physical diameters of a few times that of the Earth. However, when considering smaller objects in the solar system, such as comets, asteroids, and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), their sizes become much more difficult to determine. For example, the typical large KBO system has a diameter of a few hundred kilometers, corresponding to less than 1 arc-second, or a few tens of kilometers, in visible light. To characterize the size and structure of these objects requires a detailed understanding of how light interacts with them. As a first step, this work determines the reflected light curves and sizes of largest object in the Kuiper Belt, dwarf planet (1480) Pluto. Using observations in the visible and infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the apparent diameters of Pluto and Charon as a function of phase angle, and produce the first light curves of Pluto and Charon. These observations place the size of the largest object in the Kuiper Belt at approximately 500 km x 400 km, with 3-4 components, corresponding to a physical diameter of 300-400 km.

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass.

In this study, we evaluate Milky Way globular clusters using high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey, which includes 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals that the color-metallicity relation in these clusters is more pronounced than in previous studies of the Milky Way halo field populations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way galaxies can be expressed as a function of the mass of their host spheroids. This relationship indicates that Milky Way clusters reached their peak metallicity in a solar-mass host galaxy, with no evidence of a stellar community gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the strong color-metallicity relation observed in Milky Way globular clusters is influenced by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, leading to a consistent increase in metallicity across clusters, regardless of the host galaxy mass. Additionally, we compare our results with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding that the maximum metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters aligns well with the highest values observed in simulated galaxy cluster cores.

This research represents the first measurement of chemical evolution in the early universe beyond the capabilities of the EUCLID satellite and is expected to remain the most precise assessment until galaxies can be observed at significantly higher redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope or other future observatories.",

These simulations, called “models,” are used to make predictions about the universe, and they can be tested against observations of the universe.

The model neutrinos are called “neutrino masses,” and the phenomenon of neutrino mass is one of the most mysterious in all of science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detected a significant decrease in the speed of neutrinos moving through space-time, which suggested that neutrinos might have a tiny but non-zero mass. Many observations since then, however, have failed to find this decrease in speed, which would be expected if the neutrino mass was a tiny 0.1eV. On the other hand, various extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos might have a non-zero mass. These include the see-saw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By adding a symmetry which forces right-handed neutrinos to have a non-zero, but tiny, mass, the standard model of particle physics can be extended to the see-saw model. Additional experimental evidence in favor of neutrino mass includes the observation of neutrino oscillations, which show that at least two of the neutrinos have non-zero, but differing, masses. Additionally, cosmology shows that if neutrinos have non-zero masses, then they must have a “normal” mass of approximately 0.05eV or less. If neutrino masses are confirmed, then they will be the first elementary particles shown to have this property.

The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position.

Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments.

We find that even without AGN triggered starbursts, the momentum input from radio mode feedback is enough to significantly disrupt the cold streams which form the core of cooled galaxy clusters, and thus suppress the formation of bright ellipticals.

        "original_text": "We report the detection of six magnetically-driven explosions of rapidly-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) following accretion-induced collapse. The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields.

        "rewrite_text": "We present the discovery of six magnetically-triggered explosions from rapidly spinning white dwarfs (WDs) resulting from accretion-induced instability. This survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual observatory, which continuously monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. These explosions had not been previously documented in such objects, as earlier instances were limited to low-density WDs. The explosions are characterized by a swift increase in brightness in the days leading up to the event, followed by a peak and a subsequent decline in intensity. This plateau phase is attributed to the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD into a neutron star or black hole. The presence of this plateau in the light curve indicates an explosion, which is absent in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD's surface. The duration and luminosity of the plateau align with the expected range for the mass of expelled material. We compared our observations with 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse, both with and without strong magnetic fields, and found that the emissions were best replicated by simulations that incorporated magnetic fields. We estimate that the magnetic fields required to trigger these explosions are around 100 MG, a level achievable by potential magnetoreactor systems like the Exawatt Center for Plasma Research in the EU and NASA's Long Duration Balloon Program. Among the six observed WDs, four exhibited plateau-like light curves with notable decreases in intensity leading up to the explosions, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions in low-mass WDs. The other two objects, SDSS J0804 + 2052 and SDSS J2315 + 1855, displayed distinct plateau-like declines in magnitude without the preceding intensity change, marking the first observation of this behavior in rapidly spinning WDs. We analyzed the plateau durations and luminosities against simulations with and without magnetic fields, finding that emissions from both scenarios were well represented by the magnetic field-inclusive simulations. By measuring the plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the masses of the ejected material for each event, which fell within the expected range for such explosions. Additionally, we identified potential progenitor star locations by cross-referencing our sample with Gaia Data Release 2, revealing that four of the exploding WDs were likely observed within the fields of their respective host galaxies. This supports the notion that explosions from rapidly spinning WDs are more detectable from their host galaxies compared to those from high-mass WDs. Our findings underscore the significant role of magnetic fields in the mechanisms and outcomes of these astrophysical events, suggesting that such explosions may play a crucial role in the mass retention of rapidly spinning WDs.",

In this process, the verifier selects a random witness, sends it to the simulator, and receives a response. This response must include an expression that satisfies a polynomial-time verification condition for the original procedure. The proof is considered valid if the simulator accepts the witness with a probability of at least 2/3, while the witness generation phase must simulate the method with an advantage of at least 1/3. In this paper, we explore the general properties of QKZP. First, we demonstrate that this concept can be expressed within the framework of complexity theory. Building on this, we establish that the PSPACE assumption is necessary for the definition. Furthermore, we show that it is impractical to construct a valid QKZP with an advantage greater than 2/3 when only black-box access to the previous method is considered. These findings suggest the triviality of QKZP. Additionally, we propose a variant of QKZP that incorporates an enhanced soundness property, which presents its own intriguing challenges for validation.",

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface. The first is called  Spoon-fed  in which the capture material, mostly protons, sticks to the neutron star surface, forming a  spoon  shaped structure. Such transients are found to be brighter when the neutron star has a higher spin rate.

        "rewrite_text": "The title of the paper encapsulates the primary focus of the abstract. The abstract is lengthy as it includes background information on the topic and general observations about the paper. A neutron star refers to a celestial body predominantly composed of neutrons, which are subatomic particles that make up the atomic nuclei. Neutron stars possess immense mass, often exceeding that of the Sun, all contained within a volume of roughly a cubic kilometer or more. These stars form as a result of a supernova explosion, occurring when about 99% of a star's mass collapses into its core. Such extreme densities arise because neutrons are significantly denser than typical atoms, and the strong nuclear forces that hold nuclei together weaken as one approaches the core. When the core reaches approximately 2 to 3 solar masses, there is insufficient mass to counteract the core's gravitational pull. The excess energy is released in a supernova explosion, which can also be referred to as the formation of a neutron star. Most neutron stars are located in close binary systems, either with another neutron star or, more commonly, a black hole. These systems are classified as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are intriguing to study because they provide two perspectives on neutron stars. The first perspective is the quiescent state (also known as inactive or non-pulsing), where the neutron star orbits a more compact companion without emitting X-rays. The second perspective occurs when the neutron star experiences transient changes in its X-ray emissions, referred to as outbursts. Observing the transition between these two states offers valuable insights into their differences. For example, we have demonstrated that brighter transient outbursts correlate with an increase in the neutron star's spin rate. Conversely, when the neutron star is in a quiescent state but exhibits significantly brighter X-ray emissions than usual, its spin rate is found to be greater than when the emissions are much fainter. These behavioral changes have led to the proposal of a two-state model for LMXB behavior. In this framework, two distinct accretion regimes onto the neutron star are identified, with variations in how the captured material is deposited onto the star's surface. The first regime, termed \"Spoon-fed,\" involves escaping material, primarily protons, adhering to the neutron star's surface and forming a spoon-shaped structure. These transients are observed to be brighter when the neutron star spins at a higher rate. The second regime, known as \"Indirect,\" occurs when the captured material, mainly electrons and protons, creates a mist around the neutron star. These transients are found to be brighter when the neutron star is in a specific state.",

The perceived violation of power conservation in our universe, suggested by the observed dilution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), can be attributed to the formation of our universe on a brane within an anti-de Sitter (AdS) LED characterized by a negative cosmological constant. In this scenario, the universe appears four-dimensional due to a fundamental tension between power conservation in our brane world and the continuous creation of AdS LEDs. In conventional cosmological models, the heat observed in the CMB is produced by photons generated after the decoupling of free electrons that comprise the CMB. These photons traverse the observable universe before reaching us, meaning the temperature we observe is the cumulative result of the energies of all particles after their creation, prior to any interactions. If the universe were strictly four-dimensional, with no extra spacetime dimensions, power conservation would hold, as all energy would remain within the universe. However, if our universe exists within an AdS LED with a negative cosmological constant, this conservation is disrupted, as AdS LEDs arise from the dynamics of the brane world.",

All of these can be classified by their topological type, their algebraical type, or a combination of these. The most interesting 3-dimensional curves are singular ones: they are generically n-dimensional and transversal to n-dimensional space. Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space. A comprehensive theory of singular curves was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, see in particular the works of Harris and points of view of Coppo and Garrone. These works prove a deformation theoretic framework for understanding the birational classification of such curves, i.e. their ability to be infinitesimally deformed into another one. This framework implies also that for a generic choice of a curve, there is a plane in the nine-dimensional projective space of quadric hypersurfaces that the curve doesn’t intersect, and such a plane is called an exceptional plane. Curves with exceptional planes are called decomposable. This paper studies the case when the generic curve is not decomposable: it has a unique (up to projective equivalence) exceptional plane. Such curves are called non-decomposable. The most common case is when the exceptional plane is a plane of linear dependency for the general curve: such a plane is called an exceptional secant plane.

Singular curves, for instance, are traditionally categorized by their genera, which correspond to their codimensions in parameter space. A comprehensive theory of singular curves emerged in the mid-1980s to early 1990s, notably through the contributions of Harris, as well as the perspectives of Coppo and Garrone.

This paper examines scenarios where the generic curve is non-decomposable, meaning it has a unique special plane (up to projective equivalence). Such surfaces are classified as non-decomposable. A common instance occurs when the exceptional plane represents a plane of linear dependency for the general curve, known as an exceptional secant plane.

Among the six types of quarks, only the up and down quarks are found in stable structures like protons and neutrons, which make up ordinary matter. The other four quarks—strange, top, bottom—exist in combinations known as hadrons, which are formed solely through the strong force. This force effectively binds quarks within protons and neutrons, and the binding energy of a hadron is reflected in its mass. Quarks are often likened to tiny magnets and come in six different \"colors,\" a term used in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to describe their symmetry properties. Each quark color corresponds to a component of a mathematical construct called an octet, with each flavor having a unique combination of charge and mass, leading to the designations of up and down quarks (with charges of +2/3 and -1/3, respectively). The other flavors—strange, top, and bottom—also correspond to specific hadrons. These six hadron types can combine to form larger hadrons; for example, a bottom hadron contains a bottom quark and carries a small portion of its charge. In the framework of particle physics, quarks are treated as point-like particles, and their interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which successfully explains many properties of hadrons, including their spectra and decay processes.

This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density. This provides a mechanism by which the universe can undergo a phase transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of nonequilibrium, or a cooling dominated phase transition.",

        "rewrite_text": "Astronomers have long recognized that the universe is permeated by tiny particles of radiation known as cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation holds significant scientific importance as it represents the last remnants of energy produced during the Big Bang, allowing researchers to investigate the conditions of the early universe. Recently, scientists proposed a theory suggesting that this background radiation may arise from quantum mechanical effects within the cosmos. The model envisions the universe as a vast sea of zero-point fluctuations, where particles occupy every conceivable (virtual) position within this expanse. As the universe expands and its temperature decreases, these virtual particles gain a greater capacity to settle into low-energy states, resulting in a background of virtual radiation. However, this theory has a notable limitation: it conceptualizes the universe not as a collection of atoms, but as a collection of waves. This analogy is similar to depicting the ocean as a group of sticks floating on a boiling pot of water, where the waves represent the ocean's currents and the sticks symbolize the molecules in the boiling water. The particles in this model, which represent the universe's currents, have yet to be observed. In this framework, the atoms in the boiling pot correspond to the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, these photons increasingly tend to occupy the lowest energy states, achieving equilibrium with the cooler environment. When the universe's temperature drops below 3000 K, the photons no longer remain in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of radiation, allowing them to free-stream away from high-density regions toward areas of lower density. This can be likened to a container of water left in a cool environment; as it cools, water molecules gravitate toward the bottom, creating a region of lower volume compared to the surrounding atmosphere. In our research, we propose an alternative model of this phenomenon, where the molecules (photons) remain stationary while the background radiation continues to propagate. In this scenario, the universe resembles a frozen sea where the particles settle at the bottom, yet the radiation waves persist throughout the cosmos. As the universe cools, the radiation particles continue to propagate, while the particles remain settled in regions of lower concentration. This presents a mechanism by which the universe can transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to one of nonequilibrium, characterized by a cooling-dominated phase shift.",

This admission management framework comprises a controlling mechanism and a controlled algorithm. The controlling mechanism divides the entire network into several virtual channels of specified sizes by assigning various channel availability priorities. All stations within the network monitor the wireless medium and assess the corresponding transmission data levels. Subsequently, the controlled algorithm identifies the locations for establishing connections within the controlling mechanism based on network requirements and reallocates the entire channel among different virtual channels according to the scheduling results.

We present an approximate analytic technique for determining the impact of the second collapse on SSC properties, and apply it to super star clusters with a bimodal (collapse) initial density distribution. We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles.

In this theory the charm quark interacts with the quantum fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, which simulates the gluon field in the underlying gauge theory. We find that the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a charged pion can be well approximated by considering the Schrödinger equation for a simple potential model, where the coupling between quark and diquark is parametrized by an effective coupling constant. We calculate this constant using heavy quark effective theory and find that, within our truncation, it is independent of the light quarks inside the initial charm quark state. The parameter of the model which effectively measures the strength of the interaction, the effective coupling constant, is determined from the experimental pion spectrum. We also calculate the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a kaon. We compare with recent LHCb data and find a much larger effective coupling constant for the transition to a kaon compared to that for a charged pion.

The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours. We demonstrate the utility of the steady-state space use area by comparing it to the area estimated using MHRA and by using it to reduce the number of model runs necessary to estimate home range size.",

This method consists of two stages: first, space use is modeled based on various spatial parameters of potential home ranges; second, a rapid quantitative algorithm identifies the home range that best aligns with the observed space use data. In the initial stage, the method typically analyzes summary data of space use (e.g., point patterns) and leverages a growing body of knowledge about space use patterns to evaluate candidate spatial parameters. Many of these parameters are related to home range size, and efficient algorithms have been developed to test different combinations of these spatial parameters against the observed patterns of space use. While these algorithms can quickly evaluate numerous combinations, they assess each geographic parameter individually, leaving many potential combinations unexplored. The second stage involves a global search algorithm that uses the results from the spatial variable screening to swiftly identify the combination of home range parameters that best fits the observed data. Although MHRA is frequently used for estimating home range sizes in large samples, the lengthy screening process for spatial variables can hinder its practicality. For example, estimating the home range size for 10 individuals may require 45 model runs, assuming each run tests a unique combination of spatial parameters. Consequently, MHRA demands significant computational resources and modeling time. \n\nIn response, we have developed an analytic steady-state space use pattern estimator that calculates the area utilized at a steady state, which refers to the area measured when space use is consistently monitored over an extended period. While analytic steady-state models are related to mechanistic movement models, they do not estimate space use directly. Instead, they compute the flux of particles around a central point (the home range) under the assumption of spherical symmetry, with various models created for different geographic contexts (e.g., open versus closed regions). We integrate this model with a global search optimization algorithm to formulate a method that quickly identifies the home range area that best corresponds to steady-state space use patterns. The area derived from steady-state space use differs from that estimated by MHRA, yet both serve as indicators of space use. For smaller sample sizes, MHRA may require 45 model runs, whereas the steady-state space use area can be estimated with just a single model run. Furthermore, the steady-state area estimation is more accurate than that obtained through MHRA and can be computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours.

This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community.

These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals.

Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost. In addition, inflation can significantly impact project costs, and similar projects completed at different times will often have different costs due to the inclusion of updated prices and shipping delays.

Additionally, we compare the anticipated reflection signature from the CBP with the observational data, which allows us to place constraints on the distance between the CBP and the black hole (BH).",

Several classes of such scenarios are based on extended gravity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity (dS/PSR) scenarios. These all share a common feature that there exists a background field, namely a gauge field (a connection), whose field strength is nonzero and consequently a local symmetry is explicitly broken to a global one.

We develop an outbreak model for general time-varying graphs, characterize the final size of the outbreak, and perform asymptotic assessments for both the static graph case and the fully dynamic model. For the outbreak model on static graphs with randomly deleted edges, we determine that the final size of the outbreak is at most a logarithmic factor larger than the number of connections of a node, up to a constant factor. In the fully dynamic model, we find that the number of infected nodes approaches a constant factor of the number of links of a node, also adjusted by a logarithmic factor. Our findings indicate that in both scenarios, the final size of the outbreak is a constant factor of twice the number of connections of a node. This constant can be significant in real-world social networks, where most connections are casual, and a few close contacts can lead to substantial outbreaks. The exploration of general time-varying graphs may hold independent significance, as it illustrates how the frequency of visits by a node can influence the ultimate extent of an outbreak. We conduct numerical studies to assess the validity of our theoretical analysis. In summary, we present general scenarios for disease spread on dynamic and fully dynamic graphs, characterize the final size of the outbreak, and provide asymptotic assessments for both the static graph and fully dynamic models, along with quantitative studies to evaluate the performance of our findings.",

This article presents an alternative method that begins by spraying a cleaning solution around the floor, allowing it to spread through gravitational pressure. It then introduces a probabilistic framework to analyze this process. Initially, it establishes a probabilistic model for the amount of dirt on the floor and uses this model to estimate the likelihood that the cleaning process will be effective. Furthermore, it addresses the critical question of how much dirt this method can remove. The findings indicate that for a moderately dirty floor, this method has a high probability of achieving complete cleanliness, but it can only remove about 50% of the actual dirt present.

        "original_text": "The existence of massive neutrinos is one of the most important discoveries in modern astrophysics and particle physics. Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe. We provide an example of how the existence of this weakly interacting massive particle dark matter could be established or disproved by measuring the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our galaxy.",

        "rewrite_text": "The discovery of large neutrinos stands as one of the most significant advancements in contemporary astrophysics and electron physics. Among the three recognized types of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a distinctive method for investigating the interiors of stars and star clusters. This is because electron neutrinos can scatter off electrons within atomic nuclei with minimal interaction with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak absorption of electron neutrinos, leading to a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at lower energies. The intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, which was most effectively detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can only be explained by the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, a concept introduced by Ettore Majorana in 1937, with evidence first identified four decades later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the Super-Kamiokande detector provided the first direct empirical evidence of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, reporting a small but finite probability that a neutrino could be its own antiparticle in the journal Nature. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter remains one of the most significant unresolved questions in cosmology and electron physics. The leading theory for dark matter, known as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), suggests that these particles can interact via the weak force, which would allow them to generate signals detectable by standard neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters by missions like Planck and the Dark Energy Survey have constrained the maximum possible cross-section for WIMPs to within an order of magnitude of the strong force interaction factor. This is significantly smaller than the cross-section for neutrino scattering, leading to the exclusion of WIMPs as a viable dark matter candidate. Neutrino oscillations can effectively explain the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, making neutrinos an intriguing alternative to dark matter. If neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, the gravitational potential of a star cluster could trap a finite number of electron neutrinos, potentially addressing the dark matter conundrum. This process could be likened to how a lightbulb emits light when an electrical current flows through it: the star cluster acts as a massive lightbulb, with the neutrino emissions producing the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its strong interaction cross-section, we propose that the known neutrino burst is actually generated by electron neutrinos scattering off dark matter particles, which could account for approximately 30% of the universe's total dark matter density. We illustrate a scenario in which the existence of this weakly interacting massive object dark matter could be confirmed or refuted by analyzing the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our universe.",

However, various real-time systems can exhibit significantly different distributions of topological features. Consequently, it is important to explore how these distributions may vary across different random graph models. In this study, we concentrate on two specific features: the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph, both of which have well-established algorithmic methods for their precise calculation in arbitrary random graphs. Our analysis across multiple random graph models reveals that the size of the largest planar matching follows a power-law distribution in all models examined, while the size of the largest planar subgraph shows a power-law distribution in some models and a more exponential-like distribution in others. Importantly, we observe a strong correlation between the power-law exponents of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph with the exponent associated with the graph's degree distribution.

The Truecluster fitting problem involves finding an optimal correspondence between clusters and points, ensuring that the distance between each point and its corresponding cluster is minimized. In this study, we introduce a fast algorithm to address the Truecluster fitting problem by assigning each point to the nearest cluster center in n-dimensional space. The algorithm begins by randomly dividing the n-dimensional space into several cells. It then designates one cell as the query cell, identifies all clusters with centers located within this cell, and assigns each point to the nearest cluster center. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing approximate matching algorithms and yields excellent matches for datasets containing high-dimensional points.

At all redshifts the LFs are relatively similar, suggesting that the bolometric corrections are almost constant at these redshifts.

This phenomenon helps to elucidate various counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics, including the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment and the many-worlds interpretation, which posits that observation constitutes a branching event in the quantum realm. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of the Born rule, referred to as the weakly generalized Born rule (WGBR). According to this framework, the WW effect does not change the probabilities of possible events; rather, it offers a new causal rationale for the observation of these potential outcomes. Unlike previous interpretations of quantum mechanics, our approach does not necessitate dismissing the many-worlds interpretation and is compatible with established views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation. We apply our theory to a single photon within a one-dimensional wave packet, observing the anticipated WW noise pattern in alignment with the WGBR. Additionally, we explore potential applications of our theory in quantum thermodynamics, predicting how a quantum system might respond similarly to both positive and negative measurement outcomes, and developing quantum algorithms without relying on explicit wavefunction evolution.",

It is believed that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as indicated by its classification as a Z-source, which is characterized by strong, often normal, high-velocity winds from the neutron star.

A significant finding of this research is the identification of a cutoff power-law structure in the high-energy spectrum, contributing nearly 50% of the flux across almost three decades of energy. This feature is rarely observed in X-ray binaries, making its detection by INTEGRAL a groundbreaking development for understanding high-energy processes in these systems. The cutoff power-law is thought to extend from the accretion disk's blackbody component, commonly found in black hole X-ray binaries, and is typically associated with gamma rays emitted from the inner regions of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole. The presence of a cutoff power-law in this system, which centers on a neutron star, suggests a new paradigm for high-energy production in black hole X-ray binaries and implies that disk accretion may not be the sole mechanism for high-energy generation in these systems. It is proposed that this component may arise from a novel form of high-energy production unique to this system, potentially linked to the strong winds from the neutron star.

In order to illustrate the tightness of the characterization, we provide a counter example where the achievable rate is strictly lower than the limit. Then we characterize the optimal power on/off strategy. Interestingly, for fixed feedback length, we show that the on/off ratio has a threshold behavior with respect to the channel realizations, and the off state is most likely to appear when the channel is in weak interference regime. Moreover, in strong interference regime, even though more power would help increase the achievable rate, it would also increase the feedback burden.

Next, we analyze the optimal power on/off strategy. Notably, for a fixed feedback length, we observe that the on/off ratio exhibits a threshold behavior in relation to channel realizations, with the off state being more prevalent during weak interference conditions.

In particular, a fundamental quantity in the QCD calculation of the hadronic spectrum is the Wilson loop, which, in the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop $C$ in space-time.

The relation between the area and perimeter laws has been observed for more than 40 years. Recently, by using the supergravity in eleven dimensions, a string theory realization of a long Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ group is proposed. The corresponding string configuration is the graviton with one temporal and one spatial infinite size. This allows a detailed comparison between the field theory and gravity results. For finite-size loops, new Quantum Mechanics-like phenomena may arise. For example, it may admit discrete energy levels with a spectrum linearly proportional to the area of the loop. In this article, we present a more general class of string configurations, which are the finite-size gravitons corresponding to loops with arbitrary shapes.

This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).

        "rewrite_text": "A0620-00, an X-ray binary located at the center of the globular cluster NGC 6205, is believed to contain a black hole that is accreting material from a Be star companion (Menou et al., 2001). This system is relatively close, at a distance of 4.3 kpc (Reipurth et al., 2001), and the black hole has a low mass of approximately 6.6 solar masses (McConnachie et al., 2009), making it detectable in the near-infrared spectrum. We have obtained near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the system using the NIRSPEC spectrometer on the W. M. Keck II Telescope. The NIRSPEC spectra have a spectral resolution of R ≈ 22,500 and cover the wavelength range of 1.0 to 2.4 μm. We utilize this data to analyze the absorption and emission spectrum of the donor star, which is classified as an A-type star. The absorption spectrum reveals Balmer and P-Cygni lines, consistent with an A0 Ve spectral classification. Additionally, we observe CO bandhead emission in the donor's spectrum, measuring a corresponding width of W(CO) ≈ 1.0 ± 0.2 Å. This detection of CO bandhead emission in the spectrum of an X-ray binary companion is unexpected and raises new questions regarding the composition and evolutionary state of the donor star. We compare the NIRSPEC spectra with those obtained from the VLT/ISAAC NIR spectrophotometer and find that the NIRSPEC data align with a constant temperature photosphere, as expected for an A-type star. However, we also observe significant absorption in the Br γ line at 2.16 μm, along with strong He I 2.06 μm and Ca II triplet emissions, which are absent in the VLT/ISAAC spectra. We model the NIRSPEC data as a simple shell of gas and dust surrounding the star, demonstrating that this model can account for the observed Br γ emission and excess near-infrared flux. We discuss the origins and implications of the gas and dust in relation to the conditions of the donor star.",

Observations revealing a significant stellar proper motion at an angle of approximately 70° relative to the molecular gas in M82's center support the idea that M82 X-1 and M82 X-4 are undergoing rapid orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission. However, this hypothesis faces challenges due to the exceptionally high X-ray luminosity of these sources, suggesting that the neutron stars involved would need to have masses exceeding 40 solar masses, which is deemed unphysical. Alternative theories propose that these binaries exist in a high-density environment that enhances gravitational wave emission.",

In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure.

This star is located in the constellation Hercules at a distance of 20.7 light years from the Earth. The existence of 14 Her planets make this system the seventh closest system to the Earth. Since the discovery of the planets around 14 Herculis was announced, several studies have been carried out in order to confirm their physical and orbital characteristics. 14 Her planets can be categorized into three groups according to their sizes. The planets in the inner group have semi-major axes between 0.13 and 0.36 astronomical units, the planets in the middle group have semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units, and the planets in the outer group have semi-major axes greater than 0.7 astronomical units. Planets in the inner and outer groups have minimal masses between 7 and 22 Earth masses, whereas the mass of the planets in the middle group is between 22 and 55 Earth masses. In this study, we performed numerical simulations to characterize the dynamical evolution of the 14 Her planets. We show that, because of their relatively short periods and the proximity of the outermost planet in the system to their star, the 14 Her planets might have formed in multiple blocks and were unable to move further away from the star due to planet-planet scattering. Moreover, we predict the existence of a fourth outer planet in the system with a minimal mass of 9 Earth masses. However, further precise radial velocity measurements are required in order to confirm the existence of this planet and to characterize its orbit. This study was performed as part of the Dynamical Analysis of Planetary Systems (DAPS) network, which was designed to characterize the long-term dynamical evolution of planetary systems.

Located in the constellation Hercules, this star is approximately 20.7 light years away from Earth, making it the seventh closest star system to our planet. Following the announcement of the discovery of these planets, various surveys have been conducted to verify their physical and orbital characteristics. The planets around 14 Herculis can be classified into three groups based on their sizes: the inner group, with semi-major axes ranging from 0.13 to 0.36 astronomical units; the mid group, with semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units; and the outer group, which has semi-major axes greater than 0.7 astronomical units. The planets in the inner and outer groups have minimum masses between 7 and 22 Earth masses, while those in the mid group range from 22 to 55 Earth masses. In this study, we conducted numerical simulations to analyze the dynamical evolution of the 14 Herculis system. We propose that the planets may have formed in multiple blocks and were unable to migrate further from the star due to moon-planet scattering, a consequence of their very short orbital periods and the position of the outermost planet. Additionally, we estimate the presence of a fourth outer planet with a modest mass of 9 Earth masses. However, precise radial velocity measurements are necessary to confirm this planet's existence and to better understand its orbit.

It is shown that Type Ia supernova data can be interpreted within the framework of an open universe with zero or even positive curvature, negating the need for a cosmological constant or dark energy. Furthermore, the data cited in recent studies suggesting the universe is accelerating is actually consistent with an open universe model that does not require exotic forms of luminous matter. The paper argues that the evidence for the universe's acceleration is inconclusive and likely reflects a bias in evidence selection. The discovery of the universe's expansion is one of the significant achievements in modern cosmology, reported by two independent teams in 2014 and 2016, and widely accepted by the astronomical community. The prevailing theory posits that a form of dark energy, characterized by an equation of state factor \\( w < -1 \\), is responsible for this acceleration. However, the theoretical foundations of this assertion have been scrutinized and found wanting. It has been demonstrated that a nearly zero estimate of \\( w \\) aligns with the supernova data across various plausible dark energy models. The empirical methods used to dismiss non-dark energy theories with low \\( w \\) have significant flaws and are deemed invalid. Recent studies have echoed these findings, reinforcing that Type Ia supernova data can be reconciled with an open universe model without the need for a cosmological constant or dark energy. The argument is made that the evidence for the universe's acceleration is not definitive and likely results from selection bias or improper statistical methods. While the Type Ia supernova data supports earlier claims that dark energy is driving the acceleration, it does not align with more recent assertions that the universe is closed or flat. Consequently, the reported acceleration may stem from biases in data interpretation or flawed statistical approaches. As research in this field is still in its early stages, the true nature of the universe's acceleration may become clearer with the advent of new observational datasets and more comprehensive simulations of dark energy. Until then, skepticism regarding the acceleration of the universe is warranted.",

Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon that allows two or more particles to exhibit correlated properties, regardless of the distance separating them. Quantum repeaters employ entangled quantum signals to distribute entanglement over extensive distances.

Conversely, systems designed for longer distances, like quantum memories, generate high rates of entanglement through the purification of highly entangled quantum systems. Both types require localized adaptations of the transmission mechanism, which limits the distances over which entanglement can be effectively disseminated.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a quantum repeater architecture that synthesizes elements from both short- and long-distance optimized models.

The paper presents a general framework for building a superconducting theory in a magnetic field. Such theory should be able to describe the superconductor below the critical temperature, as well as the magnetic materials with an Abrikosov vortices lattice at zero temperature. The starting point of the theory is to assume that the order parameter is a complex field that depends on both space and time. In this way, all the degrees of freedom associated with the magnetic field are included into the theory and the coexistence of superconductor and magnetic flux states can be described. Due to the complex nature of the order parameter, one needs to include many degrees of freedom to fully describe the superconducting state. To do so, one needs to resort to a many-body expansion of the free energy. For small coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic field, a local approximation is sufficient to capture the main physical mechanism. This is done by treating the superconducting and magnetic materials on equal footings by introducing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional. The theory is applied to describe superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale. In this regime, the London theory cannot be applied and a fully quantum mechanical treatment is required. In particular, it is shown that one can get a region in which a type II superconductor can sustain a magnetic field without any vortex lattice.",

Due to the complex nature of the order parameter , one needs to use multiple degrees of liberty to fully describe the superconducting state .To do so , one needs to resort to a many - bodies increase of the free energy . For small coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic force , a local approximation is adequate to capture the main mechanical system .This is accomplished by treating the superconducting and magnetic materials on equivalent footings by bringing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional . The theory is applied to explain superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale .In this regime , the London concept never be applied and a completely quantum mechanical treatment is required . In particular , it is demonstrated that one can find a region in which a class II superconductor can sustain a magnetic force without any vortex lattice .",
        "rewrite_text": "Theory of Superconductivity in a Magnetic Field: A Local Approximation Approach. This paper establishes a foundational framework for developing a superconducting theory in the presence of a magnetic field. Such a theory aims to elucidate the behavior of superconductors below the critical temperature, as well as magnetic materials exhibiting an Abrikosov vortex structure at absolute zero. The theory begins with the premise that the order parameter is a complex field dependent on both spatial and periodic variables. This approach integrates all degrees of freedom associated with the magnetic force, allowing for a comprehensive description of the coexistence of superconducting and magnetic flux states. Given the complexity of the order parameter, multiple degrees of freedom are necessary to accurately characterize the superconducting state. To achieve this, a many-body expansion of the free energy is employed. When the coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic force is weak, a local approximation effectively captures the essential mechanics of the system. This is achieved by treating superconducting and magnetic materials on an equal footing, introducing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional. The theory is particularly relevant for explaining superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale, where traditional London theory is inadequate, necessitating a fully quantum mechanical approach. Notably, it is shown that there exists a region where a type II superconductor can maintain a magnetic force without forming a vortex lattice.",

This process has never before been observed in such old, very first stars, and its implications for the early life of the universe are discussed. The very first stars to form in the universe, Population III, had no hydrogen due to the H<--->H2 reaction becoming inhibited by the suppression of subsequent H2 formation. These first stars were extremely massive, with typical masses of a few hundred solar masses. Population III stars, like our Sun, were initially dominated by their cores.

        "rewrite_text": "Population III stars were the first stars to emerge in the universe. Their intense emission of Lyman-Werner radiation significantly inhibited the H <-> H2 reaction, which in turn suppressed the formation of hydrogen molecules. Consequently, the scarcity of hydrogen led these stars to become predominantly core-dominant, resulting in the stellar dynamical sinking of their cores. The phenomenon known as magnetorotational breakdown, as the name implies, involves a combination of magnetic and rotational pressures that assist gravitational pressure in collapsing a Population III star. This process has never been observed in such ancient stars, and its implications for the early universe are explored. Population III stars, unlike our Sun, lacked fuel due to the inhibition of the H <-> H2 reaction caused by the destruction of later hydrogen molecules. These primordial stars were incredibly massive, typically weighing a few hundred solar masses, and were initially core-dominated. As they continued to contract, radial Greg Anglin instability led to the formation of a metal core, which eventually underwent a dynamical collapse initiated when iron atoms reached absolute zero pressure. At this point, electronuclear effects, supported by neutronization, occur rapidly, causing the infall momentum of the remaining star to become super-elastic. This results in a nuclear explosion wave that engulfs the core. The stellar processes associated with these events have never been documented in such early stars, and their significance for the universe's formative years is discussed.

Our findings reveal that the topological entropy aligns with the exponential growth or decay of the number of distinct energy eigenstates within this regime. To characterize the topological entanglement entropy, we introduce a measure proportional to the square of the mutual information, which we refer to as mutual information entanglement entropy (MIEE). Notably, we observe that the MIEE also demonstrates exponential decay in the context of finite heating. We assess the finite-length scaling of both the topological and topological entanglement entropies through precise numerical diagonalization of small clusters. These results facilitate the computation of the entanglement entropy for a variant of the toric code at finite temperatures, allowing for comparisons with experimental setups in photonic lattices that could feasibly simulate the model using current technology.\n\nThis research is driven by a growing interest in the topological entropy of the toric code as a potential qubit sound threshold in quantum error correction. We compute the topological entropy using the Loschmidt overlap transform, which relates the number of distinct eigenstates to the exponential growth or decay of Riemann zeros. By numerically evaluating the topological entropy on small lattices, we identify the noise minimum. Additionally, we characterize the topological entropy through the MIEE, which has recently been applied in photonic lattice experiments.

There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy. The results of long-term observations of the dust content in a number of galaxies, made using the 100-m and the 45-m radio telescopes of the MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and the 0.7-meter telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the APEX Telescope, the IRAM 30-m and the SEST 20-m radio telescopes in Chile, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, and other facilities have shown that the production and evolution of dust in a galaxy is associated with certain properties of this galaxy. It was established that in late-type spiral galaxies the intensity of radiation in radio wavelengths increases with time, which indicates the gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium, due to the merger of large bodies. In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies.

To address this debate, a third model has been proposed, which claims that dust originates in the intergalactic medium and is introduced into galaxies through collisions involving large bodies such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory accounts for the observed correlation between the amount of interstellar dust and star formation activity. The presence of dust influences the formation and characteristics of new generations of stars and galaxies. Interstellar dust consists of very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical studies in the visible and infrared wavelengths are particularly effective for examining the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. Long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio spectrum serves as a valuable method for investigating this issue. The evolution of spectral indices of radiation intensity at radio wavelengths is closely linked to the distribution of dust within galaxies. By analyzing changes in the spectral index over extended periods (spanning several decades), researchers can predict the extent and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy.

It has been found that in late-type spiral galaxies, the strength of radio emissions increases over time, suggesting a gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium due to the merging of large bodies. In contrast, early-type spiral galaxies show little change in radiation frequency, indicating minimal dust production.

Proposed by Luis Barreira in 2001, the GJC posits that universal topological chaos—a fundamental aspect of irregular dynamical systems—exists across a wide range of such systems. Everly's work illustrates that a specific dynamical system, which falls within this broad category and is known to lack generic chaotic behavior, does not conform to the GJC. This finding suggests that while the GJC may be false in a general context, it could still be valid for a more restricted class of dynamical systems, particularly those exhibiting certain additional properties. The implications of this research are significant, resonating across various scientific disciplines. For example, the paper's findings have relevance in classical mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, aspects of coding theory, the statistical analysis of storms and sea dust, and the combinatorial study of words.

A separation between low- and high-energy scales is established by a smallness parameter which is assumed to be the bias voltage scaled by a large energy, e.g., the plunger energy.

However, if the potential of the scalar field has a lower bound, the contribution of the fluctuations of this field to the gravitational waves is not effective. In this work, we study the maximal amount of gravitational waves generated in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effects of the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution. Thus, the fluctuation of the scalar field determining the number density of dark matter contributes to the gravitational waves with the parameter Omega_GW, which is related to the speed of the gravity. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. In addition, we study the perturbation of the gravitational wave during the sub-Hubble scales. We find that the perturbation of the gravitational wave is dependent on the effective speed of gravity during inflation. If the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then the amplitude of the perturbation of the gravitational wave is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed of gravity. This result has an upper limit, which is 1/3 for the case of two-field models and 1/7 for the case of multi-field models. Finally, we discuss the gravitational wave background from the inflationary universe. If the effective speed of gravity is larger than the light speed, there are many modes with the scale of the Hubble radius at the time of inflation, which lead to a large gravitational wave background. In this case, it is difficult to explain the recent gravitational wave experiments such as B-mode experiment and LIGO/Virgo.

This study investigates the maximum gravitational wave production in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effective speed of gravity during inflation.

Conversely, if the effective speed of gravity matches the speed of light, we achieve a gravitational wave background consistent with current observations. By incorporating a scalar field potential with a lower bound, we can describe the maximum gravitational wave amplitude, facilitating an explanation for the observed gravitational wave background while accounting for fluctuations in the scalar field.",

In this paper, we report an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice (specifically the Ti4+ sites), the crystal structure evolves to anatase type and acquires a net magnetic moment, which is found to be persistent above room temperature. This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem. In the supplementary material, authors have provided more experimental data and also some hints for the theoretical explanation of TDIM. First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic. Various mechanisms for the persistence of this net moment are explored. While substantial ionic coupling in Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is required to explain the observed moment value. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature of this moment is consistent with experimental results. Our work demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism to induce ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials. We have provided possible evidences to support the hypothesis that Ti4+ disorder accounts for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in a number of materials. Since Ti4+ disorder has been observed in a number of anatase type TiO2 samples, our work raises the possibility of persistent ferromagnetism in TiO2 based materials and related systems. This study was motivated by the recent report of persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. 1  While much research has been devoted to understand the origin of ferromagnetism in metals, understanding ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials is still an active area of research. TiO2, which is used as a semiconductor in many devices, is nonmagnetic. However, recent work has demonstrated that certain forms of TiO2 can be ferromagnetic. 2,3  Since ferromagnetism has been observed in a number of Ti4+-disordered materials, understanding the origin of ferromagnetism in TiO2 is of both fundamental and applied interest. This work explores the Ti4+-disorder induced ferromagnetism (TDIM) mechanism in TiO2 anatase. To explore the TDIM mechanism in TiO2, we synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with a wide size distribution using a sol gel technique. We explored three distinct synthesis methods to control the amount of Ti4+ disorder",

        "rewrite_text": "Understanding the origins of ferromagnetism is a central focus in materials science. In this paper, we investigate an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in the non-magnetic material TiO2. When titanium atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice—specifically from the Ti4+ sites—the crystal structure transitions to the anatase form and develops a net magnetic moment that persists above room temperature. This titanium disorder-induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in various structures, including TiO2 nanoparticles, thin films, and nanotubes. We believe our findings will encourage further research in this area and inspire additional experimental and theoretical studies on this intriguing phenomenon. The supplementary material includes further experimental evidence and theoretical insights regarding TDIM. First-principles calculations indicate that the disorder of Ti4+, resulting from the reduction of O2- anions in TiO2-anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. Our studies confirm that this moment remains stable up to at least 300 K, contrasting with previous reports that classified anatase TiO2 as non-magnetic. We investigate various mechanisms that could account for the persistence of this net moment. While significant ionic coupling at the Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is also essential to account for its magnitude. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature aligns well with experimental observations. Our research demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism contributing to ferromagnetism in non-magnetic surfaces. We present evidence suggesting that Ti4+ disorder is responsible for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in several materials. Given that Ti4+ disorder has been identified in various anatase TiO2 specimens, our work raises the possibility of recurring ferromagnetism in TiO2-derived ceramics and related systems. This study is inspired by recent findings on persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. While much research has concentrated on the origins of ferromagnetism in metals, the exploration of ferromagnetism in non-magnetic compounds remains an active area of investigation. TiO2, commonly used as a semiconductor, is typically non-magnetic; however, recent studies have demonstrated that various forms of TiO2 can exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Since ferromagnetism has been observed in several Ti4+-disordered materials, understanding its origins in TiO2 holds both fundamental and practical significance. This research delves into the TDIM mechanism in TiO2 anatase. To investigate TDIM, we synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with a wide size distribution using a sol-gel method and explored three different synthesis techniques to manipulate the extent of Ti4+ disorder.",

        "original_text": "Astrophysical jets are very powerful, collimated outflows driven from compact objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces.

        "rewrite_text": "Astrophysical jets are powerful, collimated outflows originating from compact objects like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. They play a crucial role in how galaxies and clusters acquire most of their energy and momentum. While the exact mechanism behind the formation of astrophysical jets remains unclear, several theoretical models have been proposed. Notably, it has been suggested that magnetic fields are vital for the generation, collimation, and maintenance of these jets. In this paper, we investigate the resonant coupling between fast Kelvin-Helmholtz waves and magnetosonic waves in a sheared, relativistic plasma, focusing on the astrophysical systems where this interaction may occur. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems, the resonant mechanism can effectively transfer energy from the shear to the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz signal. For simplicity, we examine a system comprising a sheared plasma moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma subjected to an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We explore the modes that arise when the linear transmission frequency of the magnetosonic wave matches the phase velocity of the Kelvin-Helmholtz signal. The most unstable mode exhibits a low frequency in the y-direction and a non-zero phase velocity in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of this mode is proportional to the square of the liquid vorticity in the y-direction, indicating that the instability is most effective in differentially rotating environments. However, the instability also depends on the ratio of shear to the sound speed, γShc, and varies with it, suggesting that greater shear enhances the mode's efficiency. We further assess the stability of this mode against non-linear effects. When the frequency of the magnetosonic wave matches that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz signal, the two waves interact non-linearly, causing the most unstable mode to evolve into a steady blast wave with smooth transitions. We propose that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves could significantly influence astrophysical jets, highlighting it as a vital area for future research. This resonant coupling may also play a role in microquasars, such as the white hole system SS 433, where two stars in nearly circular orbits eject high-energy jets. Although the stars orbit closely, the jets are highly relativistic and typically ejected perpendicular to the orbital plane. This alignment suggests that power and momentum are extracted from the orbital motion, and the extraction from a shearing relativistic flow could provide a new mechanism for this alignment. The resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may thus be crucial in understanding these phenomena.",

Despite its wide use, the WLC model does not consider the effect of the chain’s innate heterogeneity and bonds that may be prone to partial breakage. To address this deficiency, several modifications to the WLC model have been proposed. In this paper, we present an alternative theory based on the worm-like chain with breakable bonds (WLCBB). The proposed chain has several bending degrees of freedom and an additional linear stiffness resulting from the breaking and reformation of bonds. The exact solution is obtained by mapping the problem to a classical intersection problem in plane. The theory is used to study the mechanics of a short DNA fragment with two rigid obstacles located at both ends. The obtained results show that the theory can explain the DNA’s flexibility without the need to consider excluded volume effects. The theory also predicts that with the decreasing of the DNA fragment’s length, its flexibility will increase until a critical point, and then decrease after that. This paper is a revised and extended version of  1 .",

This model posits that the biopolymer is a uniform chain composed of classical segments linked by non-classical stiff bonds. However, despite its widespread application, the WLC theory fails to account for the inherent heterogeneity of the chain and the potential for bonds to partially break. To remedy this limitation, several modifications to the WLC theory have been suggested. In this paper, we introduce an alternative model known as the worm-like chain with breakable bonds (WLCBB). This new model incorporates multiple bending degrees of freedom and an additional linear stiffness that arises from the breaking and reformation of bonds. We derive an exact solution by relating the problem to a classical intersection solution in a plane. The theory is applied to investigate the mechanics of a small DNA fragment with two rigid obstacles positioned at either end. Our findings indicate that this model can effectively describe the flexibility of DNA without needing to consider excluded volume effects. Furthermore, the theory predicts that as the thickness of the DNA fragment decreases, its flexibility will initially increase until reaching a critical point, after which it will decline.

One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contribution of the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino to this magnetic moment. We find an upper bound on their masses for a given value of the lightest neutrino mass. This model can be considered as an example of an unbalanced See-Saw mechanism, where the violation of the conservation of one or several of the additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very massive particles. This model has some other interesting phenomenological implications, in particular the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this model leads to the observed enhancement of the Higgs decay to a pair of muons, presented at the Moriond EW session as an excess. Massive and massless neutrinos were hypothesized in the 60s in order to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The experimental confirmation of these oscillations has completely changed the face of particle physics and cosmology. The standard mechanism to explain these oscillations is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix through theDirac theory of the neutrino, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) theory of the photon and the Fermi theory of the electron. These three particles are now called the Standard Model (SM) neutrinos and they have a zero mass. Oscillation experiments prove that at least two of these neutrinos have a non-zero mass.

        "rewrite_text": "In recent decades, various models have been developed to address the issue of the small mass-squared differences among the three active neutrinos, a phenomenon referred to as the \"floppy masses\" problem, particularly in relation to the grand unification scale. One such model utilizes the seesaw mechanism, which incorporates heavy particles at the Grand Unification Theory (GUT) scale to generate small masses for the Standard Model (SM) neutrinos. We propose an extension of this seesaw mechanism by introducing several alternative symmetries, leading to the realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. In this new framework, unlike the traditional seesaw model, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can possess an exceptionally large mass, potentially exceeding the TeV scale. This suggests the possibility of a unique collider channel for this neutrino within the GeV-TeV range, making the model testable in the near future. We detail the implementation of this class of models, accommodating both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. The deviation from unitarity in the first column of the PMNS matrix accounts for the normal hierarchy, while a non-zero deviation in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This theory can be validated through the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, where we observe contributions from both the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino. We derive an upper limit on their masses based on the mass of the lightest neutrino. This framework can be seen as a variant of the seesaw mechanism, where the breakdown of one or more additional symmetries leads to the emergence of massless and/or extremely massive particles. Furthermore, this theory has additional phenomenological implications, including the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. Notably, our model predicts an enhancement in Higgs decay to a pair of muons, which was observed as an excess during the Moriond EW session. The hypothesis of massive and massless neutrinos emerged in the 1960s to explain solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and empirical evidence of these oscillations has significantly transformed particle physics and cosmology. The fundamental process underlying these oscillations is described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, alongside the Dirac concept of neutrinos, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) theory of the photon, and the Fermi theory of the electron. Collectively, these particles are now recognized as Standard Model (SM) neutrinos, which are considered to have zero mass. Oscillation experiments indicate that at least two of these neutrinos possess non-zero mass, while cosmological observations regarding the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) suggest that at least two of these neutrinos must be exactly massless. These observations highlight the ongoing challenges associated with the floppy masses problem.",

We compare charged and neutral particle spectra, elliptic flow, and high transverse momentum particle production, covering a range of 15% centrality covering the most central to the most peripheral Au+Au collisions. We observe that particle production at forward rapidity is very well described by a quadratic function of the number of N-particles per unit of rapidity, where N=charged or neutral. These results are compared to hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), calculations from lattice QCD, and models from weakly coupled physics. Our data show the most detailed and strongest constraints on these models, and indicate the importance of specific aspects of the dynamics of these collisions to different aspects of the observed particle spectra. We quantify these aspects using a thermal-based model. This allows us to derive the thermal parameters for the system at the chemical and kinetic freezeouts. These are compared to predictions from ideal hadron gas and transport models at both constituent-quark level and hadronic level. We find that the kinetic freezeout parameter is more strongly constrained by the data, and we extract a conservative range of temperatures of 155 MeV<T<175 MeV. The preliminary results indicate that the hadron gas phase is short-lived, with a strong transition to a dense and hadronically collapsed medium at chemical freezeout.

        "rewrite_text": "In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the systematics involved in the development of smooth objects at forward angles during Au + Au collisions at the energies accessible at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Such analyses are particularly significant for characterizing the degree of chaos and thermalization achieved in these collisions. Our findings are based on an examination of 1.7 million low-bias events from the PHOBOS experiment. We analyze charged and neutral electron spectra, elliptic flow, and the production of high transverse momentum electrons, spanning a 15% range of centrality from the most central to the most peripheral Au + Au collisions. We find that particle production at forward rapidity is best described by a quadratic function of the number of N-particles per unit rapidity, where N represents either charged or neutral particles. Our data are compared with hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), lattice QCD measurements, and models derived from weakly coupled physics. Our results provide the most detailed and stringent constraints on these models, highlighting the significance of specific dynamics in these collisions for various aspects of the observed particle spectra. We quantify these characteristics using a heat-based model, allowing us to derive thermal models for the processes occurring at chemical and kinetic freezeouts. These models are then compared with observations from ideal hadron vapor and transport models at both the constituent quark and hadronic levels. We observe that the kinetic freezeout parameter is more tightly constrained by the data, leading us to extract a conservative temperature range of 155 MeV < T < 175 MeV. Preliminary results indicate that the hadron liquid phase is short-lived, transitioning rapidly to a dense, hadronically collapsed medium at molecular freezeout. While both hard scattering and the initial phases of the atomic collision appear to be compatible with a perturbative nature, the strongly interacting final state is well described by a gluon gas with a medium centrality-dependent temperature range of 155 MeV < T < 175 MeV.",

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision.

        "rewrite_text": "In hierarchical multiplanet systems, tidal forces exerted by distant galaxies can reduce the semi-major axes of their orbits and potentially lead to type II catastrophic mergers. In scenarios with smaller outer planet masses, significant tidal effects from remote planets can similarly diminish their orbital semi-major axes while also dampening their orbits. This study demonstrates that if the innermost planet possesses a high, non-zero eccentricity, the tides generated on it can induce oscillations in eccentricity, pushing it beyond the dynamically defined upper limit and resulting in orbital contraction. We conduct N-body simulations to support this analytical theory and highlight the potential of this mechanism to reduce the orbits of non-resonant planets in multiple-planet systems. We propose that this process could account for the positions of Earth and Mars relative to the Sun and may have facilitated the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term dynamics of hierarchical multiplanet systems are significantly influenced by the orientations of the planets' orbits and spins. If the spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system may enter a Cassini state, where the forced eccentricities of the planets diminish while their orbital angular momenta remain linked. Conversely, if the spin axes are initially aligned with the orbital planes, a Kozai state can be initiated, characterized by oscillating forced eccentricities that follow the precession cycle of the eccentricity-raising node. During this phase, the semi-major axes of the planets can contract sufficiently to induce type I or type II drift, depending on the characteristics of neighboring planets. We suggest that even a single test particle undergoing apsidal motion can significantly enhance the likelihood of completing Kozai cycles before the apsides align. Planetary systems that transition into the Kozai state and subsequently experience type II or type I drift may exhibit changes in their semi-major axes that exceed those observed in the Solar System.

We apply our model to the gas observed in the prsent day universe and show that, although the Xelement enhancement is typically much lower than in high-z systems, it is able to reproduce the general trend. Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement depends strongly on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. We apply our model to a broad range of spectra and show that different spectra lead to Xelement enhancements at the level of $10^{-3} - 1$ solar values at $z = 0$ for different metallicities at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This wide range of possible enhancements highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe. We describe an effect whereby the interactions between cosmic rays and the primordial gas influence both the gas phase and the element abundances. This has important implications for the potentiality of the gas to form structures and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time. We apply our model to the gas observed in the present-day Universe and show that although the general trend of the Xelement enhancement is lower than in high-redshift systems, it is still sufficient to reproduce the general trend. We also show that the evolution of the enhancement strongly depends on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. Our work highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe and the need to obtain a better understanding of processes occurring at low energies, such as the interaction between cosmic rays and the gas in the early universe. We provide a formalism for computing the evolution of the chemical abundances, including the element abundance enhancement, starting from a given ionisation and chemical networks and a given spectrum of cosmic rays. The results of the calculations are self-consistent as they can be fed back into the ionisation and chemical networks. The new networks have to be specified in terms of the twelve essential reactions needed to generate the sixteen molecules containing a significant fraction of the enhanced elements and a full network for eleven further elements (B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po).

This has crucial consequences for the potentiality of the gas to form buildings and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time .We use our model to the gas observed in the present - day Universe and suggest that although the general tendency of the Xelement enhancement is lower than in high - redshift systems , it is nevertheless sufficient to reproduce the general pattern . We additionally find that the evolution of the enhancement strongly depends on the form of the cosmic ray spectrum at low power .Our research emphasizes the importance of research studies of the early evolution of the Universe and the necessity to obtain a better grasp of processes resulting at low energies , such as the interaction between cosmic rays and the gas in the early universe .

        "rewrite_text": "Cosmic rays interact with gas to generate a variety of chemical products. Our research reveals that this interaction also alters the elemental composition of the gas. By applying our model to the gas observed in the present-day universe, we demonstrate that while the enhancement of X elements is generally lower than in high-redshift systems, it still captures the overall trend. Furthermore, we find that the evolution of this enhancement is significantly influenced by the characteristics of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energies. Our model accommodates a wide range of spectra, suggesting that different spectra can lead to X element enhancements ranging from \\(10^{-3}\\) to 1 solar values at \\(z = 0\\), depending on metallicity, which is at \\(10^{-4}\\) solar values. This broad spectrum of potential enhancements underscores the importance of studying the early formation of the universe. We define a mechanism through which the interactions between cosmic rays and primordial gas impact both the gas phase and elemental abundances, with significant implications for the gas's ability to form structures and the evolution of heavy element abundance over time. Our findings indicate that while the general trend of X element enhancement is lower in the present universe compared to high-redshift systems, it is still adequate to reflect the overall pattern. Additionally, we emphasize that the evolution of this enhancement is highly dependent on the low-energy cosmic ray spectrum. Our research highlights the necessity of investigating the early evolution of the universe and understanding low-energy processes, such as cosmic ray-gas interactions. We have developed a formalism for modeling the evolution of chemical abundances, particularly the enhancement of elemental abundances, starting from specific ionization and chemical networks, along with a defined cosmic ray spectrum. The results of our calculations are self-consistent, allowing feedback into the ionization and chemical networks. The existing networks must account for twelve key reactions necessary to produce fourteen significant molecules, alongside a comprehensive network for eleven additional elements (B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po). The updated molecular composition can significantly influence the warming and cooling rates of the gas, star formation, gravitational collapse, and further enrichment of the gas. The effects discussed in this research are not limited to the reionization epoch but extend throughout the gas's history until it is removed from the model by some feedback mechanism.

Wang Feng, Yongchao Sun, Ping Ouyang, Xiaoping Chen, Jiaxiang Song Fluidization of a Vertically Oscillated Shallow Granular Layer The motion and characteristics of particles play a central role in many important engineering and industrial processes. An especially important process is the fluidization of granular materials, which has wide applications in the mining, metallurgical, chemical and food industries1,2,3,4,5,6. Particles in a fluidized granular layer are influenced by several fundamental factors, such as the total volume fraction, the shape and size of particles, the distribution of the particles in the fluidized bed, the energy input to the fluidized granular layer, etc. All these factors affect the fluidization characteristics of the granular layer.

        "rewrite_text": "A shallow granular layer subjected to vertical oscillation undergoes fluidization. During this process, the average density of the grains increases with depth, while the grain flux through the inner boundary decreases in accordance with Beverloo's Law. In contrast, the flux of grains passing through the upper surface does not exhibit this inverse relationship and instead varies with depth. These observations suggest the existence of a depth-dependent tri-layer structure within the fluidized granular layer: the upper layer behaves like a deep layer, the middle layer fluidizes according to Beverloo's Law, and the lower layer remains non-fluidized. This tri-layer structure is reminiscent of the sandpile dynamics seen in self-organized critical systems, with the distinction that the bottom layer is not consumed. \n\nIn this study, a horizontally oscillated deeper granular layer (measuring 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) is fluidized by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of vertical vibrations.

These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University’s 2.3-meter telescope have provided a potentially groundbreaking explanation for this paradox. Utilizing data from the Keck telescopes, researchers have identified nine dark straggler stars within three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all exhibiting strong beryllium (Be) absorption in their spectra.

Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",

This minimum causes a naturalness problem, because the quadratically divergent corrections to the neutral Higgs mass-square parameters from the SM particles are unacceptably large. The solution to this problem requires a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum with superpartner particles at accessible energies. A minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) contains two additional Higgs bosons, namely, the higgsinos and the heavy scalars, which appear in supersymmetry-breaking mass matrices. These are the supersymmetric partners of the goldstino, the photino and the zino. By proper alignment of the parameters in the SUSY-breaking mass matrices, these heavy scalars can be made relatively light, of order of the SUSY-breaking scale, while preserving the electroweak symmetry breaking. We perform a phenomenological study of the potential corrections to this alignment, and demonstrate that this reduces the mass of these scalars below 1 TeV, in a portion of the MSSM parameter space, and can be as low as 400 GeV for some parameter space points. The lightest of these new particles is a good dark matter candidate. We also study the collider phenomenology of the model, and demonstrate that this light Higgs sector can be tested at the upcoming hadron colliders, namely the CERN LHC and the Future Circular Collider, as well as the Folding@home Distributed Processing Cluster.

        "rewrite_text": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the Higgs doublet, which initiates electroweak symmetry breaking, creates a potential for the neutral Higgs bosons that reaches a minimum at zero at tree level. This minimum presents a naturalness issue, as the quadratically divergent corrections to the mass-squared of the neutral Higgs bosons from Standard Model (SM) particles are excessively large. The resolution to this challenge lies in a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum that includes superpartner particles at accessible energy levels. The MSSM introduces two additional Higgs bosons, specifically the higgsinos and heavy scalars, which are part of the SUSY-breaking mass matrices. These heavy scalars are the supersymmetric counterparts of the goldstino, photino, and zino. By appropriately aligning the parameters in the SUSY-breaking mass matrices, it is possible to keep these heavy scalars relatively light, on the order of the SUSY-breaking scale, while still maintaining electroweak symmetry breaking. Our phenomenological analysis suggests that this alignment can lower the masses of these scalars to below 1 TeV in certain regions of the MSSM parameter space, with some points potentially reaching as low as 400 GeV. The lightest of these new particles presents a promising candidate for dark matter. Furthermore, we investigate the collider phenomenology of this model, proposing that the light Higgs region can be explored at current hadron colliders, particularly the CERN LHC and the Future Circular Collider, as well as through the Folding@home Distributed Processing Cluster. We examine the phenomenology of a reduced supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model featuring heavy scalars (MSSM-HS) sparticles at tree level. These new particles arise from the SUSY-breaking mass matrices associated with the supersymmetric partners of the goldstino, photino, and zino. Our study includes an analysis of potential corrections to the alignment, enabling us to reduce the masses of these particles below 1 TeV in specific areas of the MSSM parameter space. Additionally, we assess the collider phenomenology of the model, indicating that the light Higgs region can be investigated at the latest hadron colliders. Our research covers the following aspects: 1. A brief introduction to the MSSM-HS model and an explanation of the symmetry principles that the superpartners must adhere to. 2. A definition of the model's spectrum, particularly focusing on the Goldstino, the supersymmetric partner of the photino, and the zino, the supersymmetric partner of the Z boson.",

PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations.

It is widely recognized that the use of the axiom of choice often introduces significant conceptual ambiguity in many formulations of general relativity. We will begin by presenting the foundational formulations of general relativity, demonstrating that the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, along with the Poisson equation, are two formulations that do not depend on the axiom of choice. Utilizing these concepts, we will derive Newton's law of universal gravitation and subsequently show how to arrive at Einstein's equations of general relativity through Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian topology, reflecting Einstein's gravitational framework from 1921. Finally, we will address an error found in the 1977 edition of Stephen Hawking's textbook on special relativity, which led him to mistakenly conclude that the axiom of choice was necessary for derivation. We will clarify that this error stemmed from using the flawed (implicit) Euler-Lagrange formulation of the principle, rather than the correct (explicit) Lagrange formulation. By employing the correct Lagrangian, we will conclude that the axiom of choice is not required.",

This algorithm functions by transferring selected elements into well-balanced dualheaps, which seemingly enhances the sorting process. Dualheaps are specialized heap structures where the least recently swapped item is positioned at the top. The underlying mechanics of this sorting method are complex and enigmatic, with parallelism emerging from the interplay between dualheaps and cache lines.

Notably, dualheap selection shares a connection with a stack-based sorting algorithm known as quick stack, as both approaches exhibit similarities in their implementation and underlying principles. In fact, dualheap selection outperforms quicksort on certain random distributions, indicating that this unconventional algorithm is more than just a novelty. Both dualheap selection and quick stack were independently discovered around 2008 by different computer scientists pursuing distinct academic interests. There has been some debate regarding whether dualheap selection could serve as a fundamental component in a broader continuum of data structures, akin to heaps, tries, and chmaps. To date, dualheap selection has eluded thorough analysis, although it appears to possess valuable approximation characteristics and can be fine-tuned for robustness. No comprehensive algorithm has yet been established based on dualheap selection, despite numerous theoretical advancements and successes. Despite its effectiveness on actual computer systems, dualheap selection has not been formally validated for correctness, raising questions about whether it possesses all the necessary attributes or if there are unusual inputs that could lead to erroneous outcomes.

Their interior, the so-called  nuclear sphere,  is rich in neutrons, almost half of the volume being comprised of neutrons held together with the strong force. This neutron matter is the most dense matter in the universe, similar in density to a large tumor on a human being. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a  deep crust,  essentially a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, and finally an outer layer of hydrogen and helium. At the core of many neutron stars is a material core, supported by the strong force, which is most likely made of one of several forces that give rise to superconductivity, i.e, Fermi, Coorbital, U(1) or colour superconductivity. Type II superconductivity occurs in metals at low temperatures. In a magnetic field, the superconducting electrons line up into pancakes, forming fluxoids. The resulting field is maximal at the mid-plane of the star and tapers off near the surface. If the total flux is an integer multiple of the quantum of flux, ωφ0, the field is called  toroidal.  Depending on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the condensation energy, this field is either stable or unstable. In this work, we study a subset of the stable solutions, those with integral flux quanta. We find that the ratio of the toroidal field energy to the rest of the star goes as the fifth power of the field strength, so there is little free energy in the field at typical neutron star fields. The field lines then naturally bundle in flux bundles of integral quanta. For a strong enough magnetic field, there is a discontinuity in the poloidal magnetic field, and the field is called force-free. This situation arises when there is a magnetic field-induced modification to the equation of state for the superconductor, so the magnetic and condensation energies are not in balance. A toroidal field modifies the structure of a neutron star in two primary ways. The magnetic pressure is enhanced in the core, increasing the pressure even as the density drops.

Despite the rapid advancement of electronic assessments in CBL, current evaluation methods predominantly depend on self-reporting and think-aloud protocols, which fail to accurately reflect participants' mental and emotional experiences. This document introduces a novel approach called evaluation as communication (EAC) to assess these experiences. The EAC method gathers data on participants' verbal and non-verbal communication during CBL tasks and employs data extraction and natural language processing techniques for analysis. This section outlines the results of a study assessing the feasibility of the EAC method using an AI-driven CBL program. The survey demonstrated a 76% statistical significance in distinguishing different communication styles between low and lower-performing learners, along with an 85% agreement between human coding and the machine-learning approach for categorizing communication styles.",

If we extrapolate the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest possible energies, we expect the particle exchanges to involve gravitons, which could explain the observed gravity, and, possibly, also photons and fermions. In this work, we discuss the first option. Gravitons are the expected carrier of the gravitational interaction, which otherwise feels indirect through intermediate messengers.

However, the fact that they are spin-1/2 fermions rather than spin-2 bosons has so far prevented them from being observed. In this work, we propose a way for photons and fermions to interact directly, through a new Lorentz- and CPT-violating term in the Standard Model Lagrangian.

Gravitons carry both the gravitational and Lorentz-violation interactions, leading to a unique signature of completely missing particles, with two corresponding jets emerging at high invariant mass. Photons and fermions only carry the gravitational interaction. Therefore, their phenomenological implications are different. Photons and fermions can decay to gravitons, so the signature would be two jets plus missing energy. If the graviton is the lightest of the new particles, the signature would instead be four jets.

When we extend the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest energy levels, we anticipate that these exchanges may involve gravitons, which could account for the observed effects of gravity, as well as potentially photons and fermions.

We identify potential methods to test this hypothesis in both current and future collider experiments. Gravitons would mediate both gravitational and Lorentz-violating interactions, resulting in a distinctive signature of nearly stable particles, with two jets emerging at high invariant mass. In contrast, photons and fermions would only mediate gravitational interactions, leading to different phenomenological outcomes. These particles could evolve into gravitons, producing a signature of two jets accompanied by missing energy.

We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region.

We apply our duality framework to investigate a problem concerning hereditarily just-infinite groups. A group \\( G \\) is termed hereditarily just-infinite if every subgroup of \\( G \\) is either just-infinite or finite, thus extending the concept of just-infinite groups. We establish that if a one-relator group with torsion is hereditarily just-infinite, then its abelianization is an elementary amenable set, which serves as a direct generalization of a classical theorem by Mal’cev.",

N-body simulations have proved to be a powerful tool for predicting the frequency and properties of satellite galaxies, but predictions still require observationally-informed scaling with the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been identified in cosmological dark matter simulations, without including the baryonic physics that would likely disrupt them. In this work we use a set of zoomed-in, high-resolution cosmological simulations to examine the relation between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. We find a strong dependence of the survival of satellite galaxies on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, and on their orbital parameters. Satellite galaxies that are on highly eccentric orbits are much more likely to survive for several crossing times than those on more circular orbits. Satellites on prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those on retrograde orbits, and satellites on highly radial orbits are more likely to survive than those on low-radius orbits. Satellite galaxies that form near the center of their host are more likely to survive than those that form far from the center. We also find that the internal structures of galaxies, as measured by their phase-space structure, are a better predictor of the fate of satellites than their dark matter halos. In particular, satellites that are either on radial orbits or on highly eccentric orbits will have large amounts of stars stripped from their outer parts. The time until all of the satellite’s stars are removed depends on its orbit, with radial orbits being more unstable than more circular orbits.

Mergers between galaxies are crucial for their evolution, as they can introduce new material, angular momentum, and potentially new satellite galaxies. However, the search for satellite galaxies has historically posed challenges, as they are often quickly disrupted or destroyed by the galactic environment. N-body simulations have proven to be an effective method for predicting the frequency and structure of satellite galaxies, though these predictions require observationally-informed scaling with the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been analyzed in cosmological dark matter simulations without accounting for baryonic physics, which could potentially harm them. In this project, we employ a series of high-resolution, zoomed-in cosmological simulations to explore the relationship between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. Our findings indicate a strong dependence of satellite galaxy survival on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, as well as their orbital dynamics. Satellites on highly eccentric orbits are significantly more likely to endure over multiple crossing times compared to those on circular orbits. Additionally, satellites in prograde orbits around their host have a higher chance of survival than those in retrograde orbits, and those on highly radial paths are more stable than those on smaller-radius orbits. Satellites that form closer to the center of their host galaxy are also more likely to survive than those that form farther away. Furthermore, we discover that the internal structures of galaxies, as indicated by their phase-space characteristics, are more reliable predictors of satellite fate than their dark matter halos. Specifically, satellites on radial or highly eccentric orbits tend to lose significant amounts of stars from their outer regions. The time it takes for all stars in a satellite to be stripped away varies with its orbit, with radial orbits proving to be more unstable than circular ones. Overall, our research highlights the significant role that mergers play in shaping the satellite galaxies observed in the universe today.",

This is possible due to the recent development of a scheme for the determination of interfacial quantities from computer simulation of only the solute particle system. This approach is based on constructing interfaces in the simulation box that match a geometrical definition of interfacial surface, and monitoring various interfacial properties, such as average position and orientation of solute particles as a function of simulation configuration. In this way we are able to measure the interfacial tensions between two coexisting phases of tangent hard sphere chains (THC), a model system used extensively to test methods for computational interfacial studies. We find that the interfacial tensions between coexisting liquid and vapor phases and between liquid and solid phases are all positive and of similar magnitude (ca. 27 mN/m), in contrast to the typical situation in liquid-vapor and oil-water systems (ca. 40 mN/m), and hence more representative of real liquids.

Due to their relatively large size and high degree of stiffness, bottlebrush polymers are often unable to adapt to the irregularities in their embedding environments, and consequently exhibit inadequate processability and function in solution or the solid state. The problem of stiffness can be mitigated by incorporating chemically crosslinkable side chains on the bottlebrush, thereby allowing the brush segments to be crosslinked once for a global change in the stiffness of the brush. However, the brush and crosslinker segments then come into close proximity, and in the absence of specific non-covalent interactions, may undergo crosslinking, even at low degrees of conversion. Here we show that mutual interaction between the brush and crosslinker segments – namely π-π interaction between the side chain polymers and Flory-Huggins interaction between the fluorocarbon and carbon backbone polymers – leads to crosslinking-induced softening of the brush stiffness. This approach allows independent control of stiffness and processability of bottlebrush polymers through appropriate selection of non-covalent and covalent interactions.

If this hypothesis holds true, this low-energy electron-positron component could serve as a more comprehensive observable indicator of shock modification by cosmic rays.",

I find that when interlacement changes at a sufficiently slow rate, the empty set is almost surely vacant. In contrast, when interlacement occurs rapidly, I establish that the empty set has full strength. I utilize these results and their correlations to confirm that when interlacement percolates, it connects with almost certainty. Interlacement was first described by S. Interlacements and I. Melbourne in 2010. In this study, I examine the empty set of random interlacements and establish that when interlacement varies slowly, the empty set is almost surely vacant. When interlacement is rapid, I show that the empty set has full strength. I use these results and correlations to confirm that when interlacement percolates, it connects with almost certainty. Let Ω represent the space of all real-valued, càdlàg paths, and let Ω~+ be the space of càdlàg paths starting at zero.

The afterglow phase encompasses optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands and can be effectively described by a single power law.

For this, we consider both the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation and the two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations with finite resistivity. Using analytical and numerical techniques, we reveal that excitation of nonlinear waves may occur at different parameters. We have demonstrated that excitation of electromagnetically non-dispersive shock waves is possible even in an isotropic plasma, i.e. when the electron flow velocity and the magnetic field have equal amplitudes. By means of numerical simulations, we have found that this phenomenon is possible due to the symmetry breaking effect, namely, if the plasma is uniformly magnetized in one direction, it is possible to generate electromagnetic shock waves with any direction in the isotropic plasma. Additionally, we have shown that in the framework of the NLS and MHD equations, it is possible to generate electromagnetic wave-like solitons when the flow velocity and magnetic field are of different amplitudes. We have revealed that these wave-like solitons are dispersive in the framework of the NLS equation, and dispersionless in the two-dimensional MHD equation with finite resistivity.

We have calculated the Euler equations of hydrodynamics, taking into account the self-gravity of the gas and the nuclear energy production term in the energy equation. These equations were solved within a Cartesian grid domain measuring 1000 x 1000 x 300 Schwarzschild radii of the white dwarf. The models examined the impact of varying the strength of the atomic energy production term and the mass flux at the inner boundary. Our findings indicate that a sufficiently strong radioactive heat production term leads to the formation of a shock wave that transitions across the inner radial boundary. Furthermore, a moderate mass flux through this boundary results in the establishment of a stable boundary layer structure. Notably, we discovered that the presence of this boundary layer significantly modifies the system's emission spectrum, potentially leading to double-peaked emission lines, such as the C III emission lines observed in the cataclysmic variable AE Aquarii. Additionally, we observed substantial supersonic motion within the boundary layer, which likely contributes to the strong broad emission line features seen in certain systems.

In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced. This field, called the chameleon field, couples to the world volume of the brane via the Israel coupling, where the coupling strength is related to the brane tension. By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass. With explicit breaking, the scalar masses can be naturally of order one, if some conditions are satisfied on the soft parameters.

We report on the results of recent X-ray observations of this object with both the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and the Chandra High Energy Transmissions Gratting Facility. We fit the data with a model that consists of a Compton-thick thermal accretion disk corona component and a complex reflection spectrum. We find that the coronal temperature is surprisingly low at kT ≈ 0.65 keV, and the coronal ionization parameter is large at 0.7 erg cm s −1. The size of the coronal region is extremely large, extending out to a radius of 14 parsecs (or 40 kiloparsecs), as indicated by the large value of the light-crossing time for the corona, τ cross = 57 light- days. These results challenge models in which the primary emission is blackbody radiation from a cool, thin accretion disk. Instead, we suggest that the primary emission is produced by a hot, thick accretion disk that is optically thick not only to direct emission, but also to Compton scattering. If the primary emission extends down to the last stable orbit, as appears to be the case in this source, then we must be viewing the inner regions of the accretion flow almost exactly edge-on.

        "rewrite_text": "3C 382 is a well-known radio galaxy featuring a highly Compton-thick active core. The predicted size of the obscuring column is several times 10^25 cm−2. Observations of this galaxy have historically posed challenges, resulting in very few spectra of its nuclear emission being available. In this report, we present findings from recent X-ray observations conducted using both the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Facility. Our analysis incorporates a model that includes a Compton-thick accretion disk corona and a complex reflection signal. Notably, we find that the coronal temperature is unexpectedly low at kT ≈ 0.65 keV, while the coronal ionization rate is remarkably high at 0.7 erg cm−3 s−1. The coronal region is extraordinarily large, with a diameter extending up to 14 parsecs (or 40 kiloparsecs), as evidenced by the substantial light-crossing time for the corona, τ_cross = 57 light-weeks. These findings challenge existing models that suggest the primary emission originates from blackbody radiation emitted by a cool, narrow accretion disk. Instead, we propose that the primary emission arises from a heated, thick accretion disk that is optically dense to both direct emission and Compton absorption. If the primary emission indeed extends to the last stable orbit, as seems to be the case for this source, it implies that we are observing the inner regions of the accretion flow from a nearly edge-on perspective. We also explore potential geometries that could account for the large-scale coronal emission while avoiding such an extreme observation angle.",

A protein-coding gene undergoes transcription into RNA, which carries the nucleotide sequence—referred to as the DNA \"message\"—to ribosomes for translation into proteins. Gene expression is inherently stochastic, and gene regulation aims to manage this randomness to achieve specific outcomes. Gene expression is a focal point of extensive research efforts.",

These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory. This paper is a preliminary investigation of inflation from superstrings. There are many interesting open questions that we have not yet considered. For example, if we also wish to obtain a period of $N$th order inflation, with $N$ being larger than two, the analysis will require a more careful treatment of higher order corrections to the superpotential and Kähler potential. We also need to consider a range of various moduli and extranet field values, as well as the dependence on the full string theory landscape.

Additionally, the effects of moduli stabilization on vacuum energy and the feasibility of accurate cosmological predictions must be examined. The proposed collider signatures will also need to be adapted within the full superstring theory framework. Therefore, while this paper presents a novel avenue for realizing inflationary cosmology through superstrings, we acknowledge that further research is required to actualize this potential.

However, the commonly used separated antennas in these systems often result in a sparse multipath channel, characterized by a flat frequency response but with distinct impulses at various delay points in the time domain. This study explores the capacity and reliability of such sparse multipath networks in the wideband regime. It is shown that capacity is logarithmically dependent on the channel's coherence time, while reliability decreases exponentially with respect to coherence time. The research further examines the tradeoff between capacity and reliability in terms of the logarithmic exponent of coherence time. Numerical results confirm the validity of the derived expressions for capacity and reliability, indicating that reliability consistently surpasses capacity across all scenarios. This research is crucial for assessing the potential efficiency gains from deploying multiple antennas in both current and next-generation communication systems operating in the wideband regime.",

        "rewrite_text": "This paper introduces universal invariants for enhanced K-theory and broader signatures, illustrating their significance by analyzing the higher K-theory of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups. These universal invariants adhere to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, facilitate the computation of the fundamental group, and comply with the universal coefficients theorem. Within this framework, the strong Novikov theorem—which asserts that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are fundamental to degree-one cohomology groups—parallels the homotopy invariance of enhanced K-theory. This relationship indicates that higher K-families conform to the Hirzebruch signature theorem and, under specific conditions, reveal exotic components in the stable homology of manifolds. We also develop twisted versions of these universal invariants and extend their application to the Bismut interchange formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. Our approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants is applicable to other stable homotopy theories, including bordism and generalized cohomology. Specifically, we define twisted versions of these theories and demonstrate how to compute these variants using the invariants established in this work. This methodology integrates the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a singular universal theory of stable derived functors.

        "original_text": "A popular supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenario is the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), in which the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) assumption is made about the initial conditions of the soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters. In this scenario, the parameters of the CMSSM are fully determined by just four input parameters: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu). Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters. The global best-fit point for the CMSSM is found for m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(mu) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(mu) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. Thus, we observe that, within the context of the CMSMS, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is very significant, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the LHC LHC phenomenological realm, with larger values of MLsp yielding a more constrained LHC phenomenology.

        "rewrite_text": "A widely recognized scenario for supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking is the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), which operates under the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) assumption regarding the initial conditions of the SUSY-breaking variables. In this framework, the CMSSM parameters are fully defined by four input values: the universal scalar mass, m0; the universal trilinear scalar coupling, a0; the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta; and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(μ). Current experimental data, particularly the measured masses of quarks and leptons, can be utilized to derive preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, this paper demonstrates that, in addition to m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(μ), another SUSY-breaking parameter, the gluino mass (MLsp), also assumes a preferred value when these experimental constraints are applied. We refer to this broader framework as the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSMS). We conduct a global fit of the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters—m0, a0, tan beta, sign(μ), and MLsp—to the observed masses of sparticles and the HPS1 variables, α(GUT), m0(3), and A0, in order to identify the best-fit points and their 1 sigma uncertainties. The optimal fit for the CMSSM is found at m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(μ) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(μ) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. This indicates that, within the CMSMS framework, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This finding is crucial, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the phenomenological landscape at the LHC, while higher values lead to a more restricted LHC phenomenology. Nevertheless, the best-fit points for both the CMSSM and CMSMS are closely aligned and consistent, suggesting that the distinction between these two scenarios is not statistically significant. The preferred values for the universal scalar mass parameter (m0), the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter (a0), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan beta), and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter (sign(μ)) derived from current experimental evidence in the CMSSM are also in agreement with those favored by the data in the CMSMS. Thus, we observe no significant conflict between these two models.",

        "rewrite_text": "Late Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), often referred to as Long-Term Memory, relies on the presynaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and the metabolism of postsynaptic proteins. Its maintenance requires NMDA receptor activity and the synthesis of new proteins. In this study, we propose a theory of late L-LTP that integrates these three fundamental components. Our model is capable of producing both long-term depression (L-LTD) and long-term memory, phenomena also associated with late L-LTP. Consequently, this model may serve as a valuable tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of late L-LTP.\n\nThe model is divided into three sections: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and the interaction between the two. The presynaptic section involves the activation of mGluRs by an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter concentration, which triggers a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C cascade leading to calcium mobilization. This calcium influx is crucial for the production of key molecules involved in the maintenance of L-LTP. The postsynaptic section addresses the generation of glutamate receptors with a half-life of several hours. Finally, the interaction between the presynaptic and postsynaptic components results in long-term depression (L-LTD) when the concentrations of postsynaptic glutamate and presynaptic neurotransmitter decrease. Our findings indicate that this model can effectively generate both long-term depression and long-term potentiation related to late L-LTP, suggesting its potential as a resource for further elucidating the basic mechanisms of late L-LTP.\n\nAcknowledgments: This project was supported by NSF grants 1719653, 1719564, 1820822, 1834991, and 1900094.

Fluid mechanics is the study of fluid behavior without considering radiation or mechanical phenomena. The dynamics of a viscous fluid can be characterized by hydrodynamic equations, including the continuity equation for mass conservation, the liquid velocity reflecting Newton's laws of motion, and appropriate boundary conditions such as no-slip or zero shear in channels.

It also describes the dynamics and formation of spacetime. The theory emerged from efforts to reconcile Isaac Newton's universal gravitational concepts with accurate descriptions of planetary and stellar motions. While special relativity effectively models light dynamics at the scale of celestial bodies, Newton's framework falls short in explaining certain observations. Einstein's field equations represent a prominent example of the nonlinear formulation of general relativity, which lacks a general solution; thus, Einstein supplemented his theory with a concept of the existence of a...",

        "rewrite_text": "Bipolar spintronics combines the benefits of ferromagnetic materials with spin electronics by utilizing both electron and hole spins. This approach leverages spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to generate or detect spin polarization, while ferromagnetism serves as a means for data storage. The first notable application of bipolar spintronics was the observation of the spin Hall effect in 1977. Since then, extensive research has been conducted in this field, leading to various proposed applications, including the anomalous Hall effect, pure spin current injection, and spintronics-based logic. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of bipolar spintronics, covering topics from spin injection to spin-controlled logic. \n\nWe start with a brief introduction to spin and the formulation of the spin Hall phenomenon, followed by a discussion of its discovery and initial experimental findings, particularly regarding the anomalous Hall effect, spin rectification, and spin pumping. These latter two phenomena have been recognized as crucial for advancing the study of spin transport and its applications. We explore theoretical models of the spin Hall effect based on classical mechanics and spin drift-diffusion equations, which serve as the groundwork for further analytical and mathematical evaluations of spin flow. \n\nThe paper also reviews research on spin flow in narrow magnetic films and presents empirical studies on the anomalous Hall effect and spin rectification in thin films, highlighting the role of topological terms in the anomalous Hall effect. Additionally, we examine spin rectification through spin mixing and communication, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these effects in practical applications. The formation of topological phases in electron systems with spin-orbit interaction is discussed, linking topological spin, anomalous Hall, and topological Hall effects to this topological phase. \n\nWe then delve into the injection of spin current as it relates to the spin Hall phenomenon, summarizing direct observations of this effect in metallic systems and extending the discussion to semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, and topological insulators, including recent findings on surface states in topological insulators. Methods for measuring spin accumulation are also addressed, along with an overview of spin behavior in semiconductors. Finally, we outline the implementation of bipolar spintronics, focusing on devices based on spin-charge conversion, exchange interactions, tunnel magnetoresistance, and spintronic applications.",

Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. It is suggested that the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation can be used as a new standard for estimating the black hole mass.

        "rewrite_text": "Supermassive black holes are found in all large galaxies and form over time through the accumulation of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which relies on three key variables: the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion, and the radius of the black hole's sphere of influence. The first two variables are measured for the galaxy, while the third can be determined from the mass of the black hole. There is a strong correlation between the last two variables, allowing for the estimation of the black hole's mass. Studies conducted on a large sample of galaxies have demonstrated that more massive galaxies tend to host more massive black holes. This relationship can be expressed as a linear equation: M_BH = A × M_spheroid + B, where M_BH represents the black hole mass, M_spheroid is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient approximately equal to 7, and B is a constant. This correlation has been validated across various Hubble types, particularly among early-type galaxies. The correlations with the properties of the host stars are stronger for the spheroid mass than for the black hole mass, which may be attributed to the merger-induced growth of red galaxies. The scatter in this relationship can be minimized by incorporating another observable, specifically the luminosity of the spheroid. This luminosity can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are already needed for the previous calculations. The radius can be derived from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. Research indicates that the scatter in the black hole mass-luminosity relation for spheroids is significantly less than that of other relations, with the best-fitting coefficient closer to 10. This improvement is likely due to more precise measurements and reduced intrinsic scatter in spheroid luminosity. It is proposed that the black hole mass-luminosity relation for spheroids could serve as a new standard for estimating black hole mass. This text is a preprint intended for the Astrophysical Journal.

In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization.

In this study, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the occurrence of negative refraction and emission reduction in a resonant plasmon-radiative medium, utilizing inverse Faraday rotation in a thin yttrium iron garnet tape. We observed a resonant refraction decrease exceeding 25%, surpassing that of conventional resummed negative-index materials. Additionally, the derived absorption reduction exceeds 10% within the specified frequency range, marking the highest measurement recorded for any resonant plasmon-radiative materials. Our findings indicate that radiative losses could serve as an effective approach to enhance absorption and refraction in plasmonic and magnetic media.",

To first order in the usual PN parameter ( = GM/(rc^2)), where M and r are the mass and distance of the system, respectively, and G is the Gravitational constant, the equations of motion for a two-body system in general STT NGC  differ from those of GR only by 2.5PN order, because the self-coupling of the scalar field enters at 1.5PN order.

This approach addresses several limitations found in earlier narrowband HDS systems, such as the one developed by Pollefeys et al., which relies on a single optical filter, and the Huang et al. system, which, despite utilizing advanced filter spectrography, is restricted to a 30-meter field of view. We believe that this research introduces a novel narrowband HDS method that will significantly influence various academic and commercial applications in spectral optics.",

The goal is to check if the distribution of the biggest fragment – here named “vital trace” – could be used as a fingerprint to identify the origin of the sample and if it carries information about the processes by which the sample was formed. We run a supervised machine learning algorithm with three classes, namely “iron-rich”, “zirconium rich” and “304 stainless steel”, using as features the elemental concentrations of 26 elements and as target the vital trace distribution. We found that the algorithm was able to learn the differences between the classes and to generate different predictions for the three classes, with an accuracy of more than 70% when using only 10% of the samples to train the algorithm. We also applied a similar algorithm, this time using histological images of burns as input and found that it was also able to learn the difference between “304 stainless steel” and “fire” samples, even using only 3 burns to train the algorithm. This shows that vital trace distribution could carry information about the processes occurred before the formation of the material.

These are fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in an abrupt change of properties of a fluid, usually characterized by a supersonic flow jump.

There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations.

Here I demonstrate that the Euclidean path integral may be performed without reference to a global Euclidean metric, but rather based on a local thermal energy density. Because the Euclidean wormhole instanton is based on local thermal energy, the traversal of the wormhole may occur at any point along the wormhole without concern for global temperature or topology, and the traversal need only be switched on at one end of the wormhole to be complete. This allows for tunneling from one topology to another without reference to a global Euclidean metric. This new version of Euclidean wormholes is also applicable to Lorentzian spacetimes, and so Euclidean wormholes with nontrivial first homotopy group may now allow for traversal from one Lorentzian universe to another without violation of the Coleman-Herman uniqueness theorem.",

Their approach to traversing these wormholes involves performing the Euclidean path integral across the wormhole, activating the traversal at one end and deactivating it at the other end of the Euclidean universe. I propose an alternative method where the Euclidean path integral can be conducted independently of a global Euclidean metric, instead relying on a local thermal energy density. Since the Euclidean wormhole instanton is determined by local thermal energy, traversal could occur at any point along the wormhole without needing to consider the global topology or climate. The traversal only needs to be initiated at one end of the wormhole to be effective. This approach allows for tunneling between different topologies without dependence on a global Euclidean metric.

It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model. Our analysis shows that the FGR cannot be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework. We also propose an alternative perspective on the quantum dynamical phase transition, and show that QDPT exists only for the classical system, and does not exist in the limit of quantum system. Our analysis shows that the QDPT is a manifestation of classical mechanics in the quantum system due to approximation of neglecting quantum interference effects. Using the proposed alternative perspective, we show that the scale-invariance is a valid principle for the quantum dynamical phase transition. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism of quantum dynamical phase transition in the classical limit, and suggests that the scale-invariance is not a fundamental symmetry of the quantum system, but a long-distance emergent behavior in the classical limit.",

The peak of the light curve for 2001el was observed approximately 120 weeks after the fitted explosion date, and its spectrum closely resembles that of typical Type Ia supernovae one month after reaching maximum brightness. We investigate the potential causes for the mid-time light curve break observed in 2001el, comparing it with normal Type Ia supernovae and other Type Ia events observed in different cosmological contexts (SNe 2002bo, 2003hv, 2003bb, and 2003ee). Our findings support a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf model for 2001el, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a non-degenerate companion or a helium-rich composition for the progenitor. Continued late-time observations of additional Type Ia supernovae are crucial for enhancing our understanding of the degenerate binary scenario and the potential variations in explosion mechanisms.",

In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady. This provides a useful framework for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows, and has important implications for the dynamics of clusters in highly compressible turbulent flows such as those arising in the atmosphere and fusion plasma simulations.",

For example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often display a hierarchical organization, with larger-scale structures such as filaments and clusters emerging from smaller-scale eddies. This phenomenon is frequently described by power-law scaling, where the characteristics—such as height, speed, density, and heat—of eddies at one scale are related to those at a smaller scale via a specific scale factor.

As a practical application of these findings, we prove the existence of conservation laws for this equation. \n\n**Keywords:** Invariance, Conservation laws, Parabolic equations  \n**Date:** June 15, 2019  \n**Author:** Takuya Tsuji  \n**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05029  \n**Dependencies:** None  \n\n**NEWS:**  \n- Version 1.0 (June 15, 2019)  \n- Version 1.1 (June 22, 2019) - Corrected scaling invariance under xT - x  \n- Version 1.2 (July 5, 2019) - Added invariance under x → λ(x)  \n- Version 1.3 (July 11, 2019) - Revised invariance under scaling transformation for n = 1  \n- Version 1.4 (July 17, 2019) - Corrected invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.5 (August 8, 2019) - Revised invariance under x → λ(x)  \n- Version 1.6 (August 15, 2019) - Corrected invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.7 (August 24, 2019) - Corrected scaling invariance  \n- Version 1.8 (September 9, 2019) - Revised invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.9 (September 16, 2019) - Added invariance under transformation x → λ(x)  \n- Version 1.10 (October 14, 2019) - Corrected invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.11 (October 28, 2019) - Corrected invariance under transformation x → λ(x)  \n- Version 1.12 (November 4, 2019) - Corrected scaling invariance  \n- Version 1.13 (November 19, 2019) - Revised invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.14 (December 16, 2019) - Corrected invariance under transformation xT - x  \n- Version 1.15 (January 14, 2020) - Corrections and updates.",

Emission mechanisms in blazars are uncertain. A popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek process in which the magnetized central black hole powers the jet by extracting spin energy of the black hole.

It has been shown that the conductivity change can be explained by a change in carrier concentration caused by thermal excitation of deep trapping states. It has further been suggested that in order to describe the change in conductivity correctly, the distribution of activation energies of the deep trapping states has to be considered. The traditional method to obtain this distribution is the quasiequilibrium approximation (QEA), which is an assumption about the thermal evolution of the carrier concentration and requires a full description of the carrier diffusion.

No evidence of this rare decay was found, and limits on the branching ratio were set.

These are the most stringent to date. The B+ meson was created at the LHC and transported through the ATLAS detector, resulting in a data sample of (BLΛ U /Ts)×10^9 (GeV)^2. This sample was used to search for B+ --> gamma l+ nu, a radiative leptonic decay in which a B+ meson decays into a winos and a photon, with the latter carrying 50% of the total momentum of the B+ meson. The analysis focuses on the dimuon decay mode of the winos, resulting in a final state with two oppositely charged muons, at least two photons, and missing momentum from the decaying B+ meson. Two regions of the dimuon invariant mass are considered: a low mass region between 2.9 and 3.1 GeV/$c^2$ and high mass region between 3.1 and 3.4 GeV/$c^2$. A simultaneous b-flavor-symmetric signal and generic charm continuum background is generated using LHCb distributions in two orthogonal polarization directions. To model the signal, photons from the radiative lepton decay of B+ mesons are produced using a photon PDF obtained from simulation. The signal and background predictions are embedded into MCevent samples and used to determine the expected sensitivity.

It consists of an ensemble of non-interacting vortices, with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well-defined packets of each vortex sign. The vortices are self-similar and exhibit scale-invariance in the high-Cascade regime. In this paper, we develop a simplified 2D dynamical model that captures the essential features of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of the vorticity, Omega, is modeled by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Dissipation of enstrophy arises primarily through two distinct processes: direct viscosity, which leads to local smoothing of the vorticity field, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from near-core vortical zones to outer regions. We demonstrate that these two processes lead to a scaling solution with time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, in agreement with the dynamical model. We then show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is controlled by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions. We derive an evolution equation for the scale-dependent enstrophy flux and perform a linear analysis to compute the scaling of the flux. This analysis, which neglects quadratic enstrophy-flux terms, gives excellent agreement with the full dynamical model in the high-Cascade regime.

It comprises a collection of non-interacting vortices, with energy primarily focused on enstrophy and distinct packets corresponding to each vortex's sign. These vortices are self-similar and demonstrate scale invariance within the high-Cascade regime. In this paper, we present a simplified two-dimensional dynamical model that captures the key characteristics of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of vorticity, denoted as Omega, is described by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Enstrophy dissipation occurs mainly through two processes: direct viscosity, which smooths the vorticity field locally, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from the core vortical regions to the inner areas. We demonstrate that these mechanisms result in a scaling solution characterized by time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, consistent with dynamical theory. Furthermore, we show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is influenced by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions. We derive an evolution equation for the scale-dependent enstrophy flux and perform a linear analysis to determine the scaling of this flux. This study, which omits quadratic enstrophy-flux terms, aligns well with the comprehensive dynamical model in the high-Cascade regime.

In particular , the constant function f ( x ) = c is CP - generalizing for any real number c . The authors give a number of instances of functions that are CP - generalizing but do not share any other properties of Costas functions .The essay finishes with many open questions .",
        "rewrite_text": "The Costas property (CP), often referred to as the circular rotation property, pertains to the unit circle and asserts that the complex exponential map Θ(t) = e^{it}, where i represents the imaginary unit and t is a real number, completes a rotation of 2π radians or 360 degrees around the origin. This paragraph extends the concept of CP by considering a differentiable function f that is injective on an open interval I with endpoints a and b, provided that f(a) ≠ 0 and f(b) ≠ 0. Consequently, for every t in I, the equation f(x) = t can have at most two solutions. The authors define a function that meets these criteria as CP-generalizing. This broad definition encompasses various properties of CP. Notably, the constant function f(x) = c qualifies as CP-generalizing for any real number c. The authors also present several examples of functions that are CP-generalizing but do not exhibit any other characteristics of Costas functions. The essay concludes with numerous open questions.",

We compare our observational results with predictions of the classical early-major merger scenario, the delayed-merger scenario, and a novel merger-binary-spiral-component scenario. We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of pathways. At low redshift, these pathways included major mergers of comparable-sized galaxies, as well as more minor mergers and accretions. At high redshift, SDGs likely experienced more minor and major mergers, as well as purely dry minor mergers. However, we suggest that the late-stage mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies formed the dense central GC systems of the SDGs. The lack of strong rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-richness of these mergers. In this scenario, we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify 3 such galaxies. Using our spatially resolved color data, we show that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with the fraction of young stars increasing with distance from the center of the galaxy. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more extended than that of the old stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected distances within which half of the GC system’s GCs are found) and power-law slopes consistent with the predictions of recent major merger and purely dry minor merger scenarios, respectively.

        "rewrite_text": "The theory of two-photon interactions with broadband down-converted light and entangled photons focuses on the use of entangled photon pairs generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) for demonstrating quantum non-locality and entanglement. SPDC, also referred to as frequency down-conversion, occurs when a single mode of the electromagnetic field is excited in a nonlinear crystal, resulting in the production of photons with varying frequencies. The two photons produced by SPDC exhibit unique characteristics, such as correlated amplitudes and phases, as well as anticorrelated frequencies. These traits are valuable for applications in quantum information processing and communication. However, conducting two-photon interference based on these properties can be quite complex. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for two-photon interference that utilizes broadband down-converted radiation and entangled photons generated by SPDC. Our general theory effectively describes two-photon interference involving broadband down-converted light and entangled photons, allowing for the simulation and optimization of experimental setups. We derive a phase-matching condition that narrows the frequency spectrum for SPDC and introduce broadband down-converted light produced through pseudo-phase matching, detailing the down-conversion mechanisms within the bandwidth limit. The principles are supported by comprehensive calculations.",

Industrialization typically starts at the periphery of a system, where diseconomies of scale are evident, but it tends to centralize as advancements enhance productivity at scale. These increasing returns can drive centralization. A prime example is the Industrial Revolution, which saw significant innovations such as the steam engine and factory production, utilizing diverse elements. At the same time, indicators in emerging markets are focused on achieving increasing returns across various sectors, particularly in construction, finance, and waste management. These returns may stem from granular heterogeneities, such as in transportation networks, where shorter distances and expanded road and airport systems can yield greater returns. These heterogeneities can interact with technologies, as improved transportation and communication reduce the costs associated with scaling changes. Such interactions may facilitate systemic transitions. When applied to historical contexts, this paper suggests that the Industrial Revolution initiated in the outskirts of Europe, driven by significant innovations in transportation and communication that supported the adoption of the steam engine and factory production. In contrast, transitions in emerging markets often begin in the interior, where innovations may seem localized but are applicable across the broader system. These internal shifts generate increasing gains, ultimately leading to widespread acceptance throughout the system. Furthermore, these concepts may shed light on the challenges faced by established economic sectors. After achieving notable improvements in productivity at scale, heterogeneities can amplify returns within the centralizing forces of increasing returns, until the sector struggles to maintain its entrenched position.

As an explicit example, we show that a brane world in six space-time dimensions with an adjoint scalar field, where the scalar develops a VEV along the space time direction can be constructed. The model presented has no discrete symmetries, and is hence potentially realistic. It provides a self sustaining late-time cosmology that can explain the near epoch expansion of the universe, and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without the need for a cosmological inflationary period. Our model has a large number of arbitrary parameters, however we present a simple scenario in which all of these parameters are determined by a small number of parameters. The model is thus highly predictive. In particular, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane give constraints on the scale of compactification of the extra-dimensions, and the scale of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We show that current experimental bounds on these scales may be able to be achieved in the framework of our model. Additionally, we investigate the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. In particular, we show that after the spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be localized to a single 4D spatial location, while right-chiral anti- neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized over the extra-dimensions. Thus our model is not only realistic, but also solves the hot dark matter problem. Finally we discuss some of the cosmological implications of our work. In particular, we show that a 4D Friedmann equation can be obtained from our bulk theory. We present a scenario in which this dynamics, combined with the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe gives a natural explanation of the observed Hubble rate.

This model lacks discrete symmetries, making it potentially realistic. It offers a self-sustaining mid-time cosmology that can describe the universe's development during a critical epoch and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without requiring a cosmological inflationary phase.

The standard derivation of the Jarzynski equality, which relies on the reversibility of Hamiltonian mechanics, does not hold here. Consequently, it has been proposed that the fluctuation principle may not be relevant to nanodevices. We refute this notion by providing a revised fluctuation condition, which we validate through direct numerical integration of the complete dynamics of the nanodevice. \n\nIn previous works, Nataf and Vulpiani suggested that the fluctuation principle could apply to Brownian motors, demonstrating that the power dynamics during a transient phase of a Nosè-Hoover oscillator (a classical model for a Brownian motor) adhered to the Jarzynski equality. However, it was later established that the Nosè-Hoover oscillator is Hamiltonian, and thus the Jarzynski equality is valid. This led to the conclusion that the initial suggestion regarding the fluctuation principle's applicability to Brownian motors was incorrect. Our research extends this finding to nanodevices, adding them to the list of models where the Jarzynski identity does not hold. We emphasize that the Jarzynski equality is not a prerequisite for the fluctuation theorem to be applicable; nonetheless, our results indicate that even a more generalized modified fluctuation condition is satisfied in the framework we define. \n\nWe also explore the fluctuation principle in nanodevices, focusing on the relationship between the probability distributions of work done on the system and the free energy difference between two stable states.

In this work, we extend the aforementioned study by systematically investigating the effect of the quadrupolar moment of the black holes on the evolution of the Carter constant. We find that for binaries with small quadrupoles, the evolution is qualitatively similar to the case with no quadrupolar moment. However, for larger quadrupoles, the evolution is no longer continuous and can result in divergent values of the constant. We demonstrate that this behavior can be understood in terms of a simple geometric argument based on the impact parameter of the binary system, and we show that a critical value of the quadrupolar moment can be identified above which the evolution of the constant becomes qualitatively different.

This unique property has been utilized to design optical and photo-switchable molecular systems, ranging from photorefractive materials to laser data storage and molecular architectures. Recently, molecular sensors based on diarylethenes have been developed, demonstrating photochromism—the ability to transition between two distinct states, one stable in darkness and the other in light. In this study, we explore the conceptual framework of diarylethene-based molecular junctions. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics indicate that these DA molecular junctions display reversible and cyclical switching effects when illuminated with two different wavelengths, highlighting the potential applications of DA molecules in laser and photo-switchable systems. The switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives in molecular junctions has garnered significant attention recently due to their promising applications in laser memory, photorefractive materials, and information storage. Various diarylethene derivatives have been investigated as foundational components for constructing light-powered molecular systems. Typically, photochromic diarylethene derivatives are viewed as light-activated switching elements, with their corresponding molecular devices created by integrating different electrodes. To further investigate the intrinsic switching properties of diarylethene derivatives, we developed a novel chemical system where a diarylethene unit is connected to two electrodes via an alkynylene spacer. This flexible alkynylene spacer can undergo various cis-trans isomerization processes under light or shadow, leading to different intermolecular interactions among diarylethene derivatives and consequently altering the electrical properties of the molecular devices. Based on this mechanism, the I-V characteristics demonstrate that the DA atomic junctions exhibit reversible and cyclical switching effects when illuminated with two different wavelengths, underscoring the potential of DA molecules in optical and photo-switchable molecular systems. The switching process relies on the interconversion between two isomers, primarily the E and Z isomers. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the Z isomer is relatively planar, while the E isomer has a dihedral angle of approximately 60°. In this molecular approach,",

The unexpectedly vast distance and significant luminosity of this source imply that it could represent a groundbreaking discovery of great scientific importance.",

        "original_text": "This work develops a new cyclic voltammetry (CV) based technique for characterizing phase transitions and predicting equilibrium composition. CV, the measurement of current as a function of voltage, is the main method used to investigate electrochemical phenomena. The traditional approach to CV measurements is to slowly increase the voltage from an initial value of 0 until an asymptotic value is reached where the electrochemical system has progressed through one full reaction. This standard approach, known as linear CV, has several shortcomings when characterizing electrochemical phase transitions. In some cases a phase change occurs but not complete reduction or oxidation of the system. This incomplete reduction or oxidation means that the system has not reached an equilibrium composition. The traditional linear CV approach does not report whether the system has reached equilibrium composition. Another shortcoming of the linear approach is that only one voltage value is reported even though multiple phases may be present at different voltage. This work develops a new approach to CV measurement, called E-C FORC, which tracks the voltage path the system takes as it progresses through multiple phases and reaches equilibrium. Using a genetic algorithm E-C FORC is able to determine both the path the system takes as it transitions between phases and the voltage corresponding to equilibrium composition. The technique is demonstrated using ferricyanide as a model electrochemical system. E-C FORC is able to determine the equilibrium composition in both highly polyphasic systems and those with very sharp phase transitions. Additionally, E-C FORC can track multiple phase transitions and accurately determine the voltage corresponding to each phase transition.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where a positively charged particle approaches a stationary plasma sheet. Upon impacting the plasma sheet, the particle will encounter a negatively charged field, prompting it to move toward the positive field. However, before the particle reaches the plasma layer, it will pass through a region of null field, known as the plasmabal, where it experiences no force. Within this area, the ions will oscillate back and forth, resulting in unstable movement. Consequently, the particle will undergo an oscillatory motion termed bounceCTL.",

For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime.

In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma.

We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties.

The simplest form of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system consists of two independent functions that depend solely on the radial coordinate. However, these can be further simplified to a single quadrature, enabling the derivation of exact solutions in various specific scenarios. Generally, the inclusion of the Maxwell field introduces an additional conserved charge, known as the mass hair of the solution. For certain choices of plasma equations of state, explicit solutions can be derived across different regions of spacetime. The resulting spacetimes can represent black holes with gravitational mass and scalar field hair, or they may lead to bare singularities, depending on the selected equations of state. \n\nIn this paper, we introduce a comprehensive method for deriving analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system featuring a spherically symmetric plasma. This is accomplished by linking the system to a Newtonian gravity framework associated with a non-linear scalar field. We employ a series expansion around the centers of symmetry of the solution, alongside various analytic solutions from the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity, to construct the complete solution. Our general technique is applied to several specific cases, yielding new, precise solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system and analyzing their properties.

The model, referred to as 1-layer Excitable CNN (ECC), only consists of a single layer of 1D CNN, with the convolution filters shaped in a particular fashion so as to excitable. Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs). Through carefully studying the SVD factors, we are able to identify the number of factors to equal the number of path points in a path, and thus ECC can be viewed as a dynamic lower dimensional Hankel matrix completion method. We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns. We show that ECC, with its single layer representation, is much more efficient and has much less parameters than existing 2D path curve approximation methods.

In the case of metals, the work function is generally thought to be related to the band structure of the material near the Fermi level. The determination of work functions is often part of the characterization of electronic materials. It is well known that the work function of a metal strongly depends on the crystalline orientation of the material. However, it was not clear how the work function is affected by the chemical composition of the material, or how it compares to the band structure of the material. Here, we report a new method to calculate the work function of crystalline materials from first principles. Our method, developed for the particular case of photoemission experiments, is based on the effective-mass approximation and relies on the calculation of the average electrostatic potential at the surface of the material. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to a broad range of materials, and find that the work function can be up to 1.5 times larger than the band structure-derived approximation.

Because the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type of stars and their age, the SFR can be measured by fitting the FUV emission with population synthesis models. This permits studies of star formation over the past 8-15 billion years, but the accuracy is limited by our poor knowledge of the SFH over much shorter timescales.

With the discovery of SNe Ia at such high redshifts, it will be possible to measure the dark energy properties with unprecedented precision. The LSST, which is projected to discover tens of thousands of SNe Ia in 10 square degrees by 2021, is expected to dramatically improve the measurement of the dark energy parameters  2, 3 . To achieve the optimal science return from these future surveys, it is essential to measure the structure growth rate from redshift 7.5 to 10 accurately. This requires much larger galaxy surveys in the near-infrared (NIR), and breaking the *visibility period gap with NIR galaxy surveys has become a high priority for SN cosmology research. In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation. We find that the uncertainty from this relation is smaller than 0.5% in wavenumber space, and the bispectrum information beyond the nonlinear scale can be exploited to further reduce the uncertainty to 0.1%. We forecast the uncertainty from using BOSS DR12 in the LSST full footprint by combining three regions with these NIR constraints, and find that the galaxy clustering measurements will achieve 1% precision at nonlinear scales (0.2% at one eighth of the nonlinear scale) in the dark energy analysis with only 25% more galaxies than the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. We also show that combining the BOSS DR12 clustering measurements with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the planned SPHERIC power spectrum measurement can significantly tighten the dark energy constraints, and the parameter errors can be decreased by a factor of two compared to using the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone.

This phenomenon was observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as in the Fe XII 304 nm and Fe XII 525.0 nm lines with the Solar Broadband Telescope and in hard X-rays (HXR) with the Gamma-Ray Burst and Afterglow Spectrometer (GRAB). The 304 nm and 525.0 nm lines originate from higher and upper ionization levels of metals, respectively. During the flares, the loop exhibited dynamic behavior. The asymmetries observed in the spectral lines indicated that key parameters of the flaring plasma were not consistent with traditional one-dimensional hydrostatic loop theory. To address this, a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic flux-rooted loop theory was developed, incorporating non-thermal particles and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects, which successfully replicated the brightness asymmetries of the 304 nm and 525.0 nm lines as well as the temporal evolution of the loop.

The slope of this relation is associated with the density of the circumburst medium, which provides insights into the nature of the GRB's progenitor.

Their existence was predicted in 1664 by Johann-Heinrich Schroter, and the first such object was identified in 1801. TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems. Although many of these observed companions are likely remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, several systems with centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects are also clearly identified. Chaos-assisted capture (CAC) has been proposed as a mechanism to form these companions through resonant interactions with the giant planets, but recent theoretical work suggests that resonant capture may not be sufficient to explain the existence of so many multi-chained systems. In this paper, we propose another mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have been members of multiple systems: fission. We show that the sudden merger of two SDOs in a near-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO thanks to an instability that creates an additional gravitational torque. This mechanism, which we dub chaos-assisted fission, has the advantage of explaining the high observed fraction of binary TNOs without the need for planets to be responsible for their origin. We show that this dynamical process is likely to occur frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, especially during close encounters. By conducting a series of N-body simulations, we show that the instability that creates a new companion tends to occur for SDOs with a diameter of 100-150 km that are dynamically caught in an inward migration region between 35 and 40 au. For the conditions typically found in the trans-Neptunian region, the instability occurs more frequently for SDOs with an initial orbital radius of 30 au than for those with an initial orbital radius of 50 au.

The Hartree-Fock method, proposed by Paul Hartree and Robert F. Service  1  and later developed by Robert Marshak  2 , was the first SCF method and remains widely used. In this technique, the system is approximated as a collection of non-interacting electrons, or, more accurately, a set of orthogonal orbitals, called Slater determinants, that describe the system. TheHartree-Fock equation, wherein the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals, is then iterated to self-consistency, that is, to a solution in which the orbitals do not change between iterations. Several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have since been developed. The coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert  3  and developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy  4 , is one such generalization. In this approach, the orbitals are allowed to change between iterations, and the energy is still expressed as a functional of the orbitals. However, the functional is approximated by the sum of the Hartree energy and a Fock energy expressed as a functional of the orbitals. Variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT) is a similar generalization, proposed by Edward  5  and developed by Hyberts and Wood  6 . VIPT also represents the energy as a functional of the orbitals, but differs from CPHF in the manner by which the functional is approximated. The energy is expressed as a sum of a Hartree energy and a  free-energy  functional, which involves only perturbation theory within a given order. Variational perturbation theory (VPT) is another generalization of the Hartree-Fock method. It is based on a similar functional, but the functional is minimized with respect to the orbitals, as opposed to being treated as a fixed parameter. All of these generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method share the feature that the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals. This review focuses on the development of the Hartree-Fock SCF method, as well as some of its generalizations, over the past few decades. We begin with a detailed description of the original method, outlining the various approximations that underlie its derivation. Next, several variants of the method are described. We then move on to describe the development of related ideas. For example, the CPHF method and its generalizations are described, and connections between these methods and Hartree-Fock are established. Finally, some challenges for the Hartree-Fock SCF method and its generalizations are discussed, including the need to develop efficient parallel algorithms.

The Hartree-Fock method, introduced by Paul Hartree and Robert F. Service and later refined by Robert Marshak, was the first SCF approach and remains widely used today. This method approximates the system as a collection of non-interacting electrons, or more precisely, as a set of orthogonal orbitals known as Slater determinants that describe the system. The Hartree-Fock equation, which expresses the system's energy as a functional of the orbitals, is iterated until self-consistency is achieved, meaning the orbitals remain unchanged between iterations. Since then, several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have been developed. One such generalization is the correlated perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert and further developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy. In this approach, the orbitals can adjust between iterations, while the energy is still expressed as a functional of the orbitals, approximated as the sum of Hartree energy and a Fock energy functional. Another related generalization is variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT), introduced by Edward and advanced by Hyberts and Wood. VIPT also expresses energy as a functional of the orbitals but differs from CPHF in its approximation method, combining Hartree energy with a free-energy functional that relies on perturbation theory to a specified order. Variational perturbation theory (VPT) is yet another extension of the Hartree-Fock method, which minimizes a similar functional concerning the orbitals rather than treating it as a constant parameter. All these generalizations maintain the characteristic of expressing the system's energy as a functional of the orbitals. This publication focuses on the evolution of the Hartree-Fock SCF method and its various generalizations over recent decades. We begin with a comprehensive overview of the original method, detailing the approximations that form its foundation. Subsequently, we explain the different variants of the method and explore the development of related concepts, including the CPHF method and its extensions, while establishing connections between these algorithms and Hartree-Fock. Finally, we address some challenges faced by the Hartree-Fock SCF method and its generalizations, particularly the need for efficient parallel techniques.

In particular, inequalities for the joint entropy of dependent random variables are obtained. The novel inequalities are employed to derive vector formulations of well known entropy power and complementary entropy relations in information theory. The new results provide a theoretical framework for estimation-theoretic characterizations of entropy power, entropy rate, and conditional entropy, and related quantities. The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics. Here is an excerpt from the paper: A remarkable property of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical mechanisms. For example, if two random vectors are statistically independent, then their entropies add. More generally, if statistical mechanisms transform into , their entropies increase. The entropy power inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) entropy power inequality are fundamental and well known results in information theory. The former states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the sum of the entropies of its components, while the latter states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the entropy of its mean. Both these inequalities hold for any random vectors. Here we present information-theoretic proofs of the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. Our starting point is the information inequality (FI), which gives a lower bound on the mutual information. Under suitable conditions, we obtain a new family of information inequalities, which imply the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. We demonstrate the use of these general inequalities through vector forms of fundamental entropy power and entropy rate relations. The inequalities presented here complement existing approaches to proving the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. These include information-theoretic proofs based on Young’s inequality, probability distributions and sufficiency. In this paper we also present information-theoretic proofs of some related entropy inequalities, including relations for the conditional entropy and the joint entropy of dependent random variables.

The new results presented here have several important applications, including to theories of multivariate dependence, mathematics, information theory and statistics. For example, the new results are used to obtain a vector entropy power inequality for statistically dependent random variables, an application that has received considerable attention in the information theory literature but which has not previously been available via an information-theoretic approach.

For example, it was observed that certain physical systems, such as earthquakes and wind gusts, exhibit long-range power-law correlations that are similar in form to fBm. As a consequence, methods for testing for fBm have found use in a wide range of areas, including financial market analysis, human activity analysis, astrophysics, and geophysics. On the other hand, there are many scenarios in which it is desired to test the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is either fBm or an alternative process. As a typical example, when analyzing empirical data, one may suspect that the sample paths exhibit fBm behavior for some time periods, but then exhibit a different behavior for other time periods. It is therefore of interest to have a statistical test for determining whether a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm or an alternative. Such a test should be reliable (have accurate size control) and have power approaching one. The test that is most closely related to the present work was proposed in  5 . There, the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm was tested using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Hurst parameter, and the LSEE was used to approximate the sample path. Under some regularity conditions, it was shown that the test had correct size and that its power approached one. The primary drawback of this approach is that the regularity conditions were very restrictive, and it was therefore difficult to extend this approach to more general settings.

There , the assumption that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm was tested using the maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) of the Hurst parameter , and the LSEE was used to approximate the sample path .Under some regularity situations , it was shown that the test had correct size and that its capacity approached one . The main drawback of this methodology is that the regularity situations were very restrictive , and it was thus difficult to apply this methodology to more general environments .In this research , we propose an better study for checking the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fB",
        "rewrite_text": "In this paper, we introduce a statistical approach to assess whether a sample path of a Wiener process is strictly double-sidedly continuous with respect to the previsible filtration. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the test statistic converges in distribution to the Tracy-Widom distribution, which is well-known in random matrix theory. We apply this method to a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter \\( H < 0.5 \\) to illustrate its effectiveness. Our study utilizes the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the Hurst parameter, and we compute the LSEE for the fundamental diffusion system. Additionally, we establish an exponential inequality for the LSEE. Numerical simulations indicate that the empirical size of the test is well-regulated, and its power approaches one across various scenarios. We also present a real data example to validate the applicability of our proposed method. For further details, you can access the paper on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00965. \n\nZhenyu Bai and Zheng Liu, June 2023, Version 1.0\n\nDiscrete-time fractional Brownian motion and its long-term response\n\nAs a classical process, fractional Brownian motion (fBm) has numerous applications across various fields. For example, certain physical phenomena, such as earthquakes and gusts of wind, exhibit long-range power-law correlations that resemble those of fBm. Consequently, methods for testing fBm have been employed in a wide range of disciplines, including financial market analysis, human behavior studies, astrophysics, and geophysics. However, there are many situations where it is necessary to test the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is either fBm or another type of process. For instance, when analyzing empirical data, one might observe that the sample paths display fBm characteristics during certain periods, while exhibiting different behaviors at other times. Therefore, it is important to have a statistical test to determine whether a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm or an alternative. Such a test should be reliable (maintaining accurate size control) and possess power close to one. The test most relevant to our work was proposed in a previous study, where the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm was evaluated using the MLE of the Hurst parameter, with the LSEE employed to approximate the sample path. Under specific regularity conditions, it was shown that the test maintained correct size and that its power approached one. However, a significant limitation of this methodology is that the regularity conditions were quite restrictive, making it challenging to apply this approach in more general contexts. In this research, we propose an improved method for testing the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm.",

In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term.

We demonstrate a straightforward simulation of the spin network through a conventional Ising model and create an analog Hamiltonian generator to achieve high-fidelity target states. Our numerical optimization indicates that by leveraging dissipation, thermal noise, and imperfect gates, we can probabilistically produce strongly entangled graph states with fidelities exceeding 0.97. These findings pave the way for generating high-fidelity graph states using dissipative spin-chain technology, a method that can be readily implemented with existing experimental capabilities.",

        "rewrite_text": "The light-cone power spectrum (LCP) has been introduced as an innovative statistic for measuring large-scale structures (LSS) in the universe. Within the standard rulers and watches (SCR) framework, LSS creates a light cone due to the galaxies' recession velocity or the sound speed of the baryon field. By utilizing LSS as a natural ruler and clock, we can assess the geodesic length and the expansion rate of the light cone. This approach makes LSS a unique platform for investigating gravitational phenomena in a highly anisotropic universe. Recent observations indicate that dark energy constitutes approximately 73.8% of the universe's total energy density, while matter accounts for only 26.2%. This finding, known as cosmic acceleration, highlights the nature of dark energy as one of the most significant unresolved questions in fundamental physics and astronomy. Given that the equation of state (EOS) of dark energy is closely linked to the universe's expansion history, precise measurements of its EOS can be achieved using LSS as a natural ruler. In this study, we develop a simulation-independent LSS statistic by analyzing the anisotropic multipoles of LSS. By employing a cubic-map formula to interpolate LSS in simulations, we measure the multipoles up to the 10th order in the anisotropic scenario. To evaluate the effectiveness of this statistic, we apply it to the most accurate simulation produced by the IllustrisTNG program. Our findings reveal that observing the first two anisotropic multipoles can resolve the degeneracy between the EOS and the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) framework. Additionally, the ratio of the first two multipoles remains unaffected by the bias between LSS and dark matter. Consequently, this LSS statistic emerges as a promising tool for exploring gravitational dynamics and enhancing our understanding of dark energy.",

Historically, it was thought that these outflows were powered solely by energy lost by stretching of the GRB jet, which launches at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a viable model for the observed diversity of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During a GRB, the surface of the magnetar may emit gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, which could power a cosmological population of highly-relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds. While some baryonic-wind models produce mildly-relativistic jets that could account for some of the diversity of long-duration GRBs, these models tend to over-predict the amount of energy that can be extracted from the central NS. We demonstrate that a better coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows via neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux can solve this problem. In particular, we consider a combination of a baryonic wind from a magnetar with a mildly-relativistic jet, and find that the total energy coupled to the winds can account for the majority of long GRBs.

Traditionally, it was believed that these outflows were solely driven by the energy lost from the expanding GRB jet, which travels at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be fueled by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that many known GRB central engines are rapidly losing rotational energy through this process. If sufficient energy is associated with these storms, the outflow can be mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a plausible explanation for the observed variety of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly spinning neutron star (NS), referred to as a magnetar, is widely regarded as the primary engine behind short-duration GRBs. During a GRB event, the magnetar's surface may emit gravitational waves (GW), which could power a cosmological array of highly relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds. While some scenarios involving baryonic winds can produce slightly relativistic jets that may explain some of the diversity seen in short-duration GRBs, these models often overestimate the power that can be extracted from the neutron star. We propose that a more effective coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows through neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux could resolve this issue. Specifically, we investigate the interplay between a baryonic wind from a magnetar and a mildly relativistic jet, finding that the total energy transferred to the winds can account for most short GRBs.

Historically, SPMs have been characterized with binary classification approaches, whereby proteins are classified as either stable or unstable based on some SPM-specific stability metric. While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult. Recently, a new SPM characterization paradigm has emerged, known as  energy decomposition analysis . In essence, this method first characterizes the wild-type protein with a high-level method like molecular mechanics energy decomposition analysis (MM-EDA). For each SPM, the method then decomposes the total energy difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins into residue-level contributions. This method allows us to capture site-specific contributions of the mutant and wild-type proteins, and therefore may be a better tool for understanding the stability impacts of SPMs. We tested this paradigm on the recently published CO-BRASS data set (1). In this dataset, the authors experimentally characterized the effects of 402 alanine mutations in flavodoxin (a 7.3 kD protein). Each mutation was examined in both the oxidizing (oxidized) and non-oxidizing (reduced) states. The authors determined that 220 mutations resulted in significant stability changes. Using the energy decomposition method, we were able to accurately predict whether a SPM would impact stability (i.e. be positive or negative). As shown in Table 1, we were able to achieve 91% accuracy on the test set.

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",

A group consists of a set of transformations that includes an identity element and allows for composition among its members. In this context, the Lorentz transformations illustrate how various quantities change with velocity. Specifically, by knowing an object's velocity, one can apply the Lorentz transformations to determine how it evolves over time, which in turn facilitates the calculation of spatial transformations. This discussion highlights that, despite the Lorentz transformations being established long ago, they continue to provide valuable insights into the study of mathematics and mechanics. It particularly emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between first and second-order equations in physics. The essay further delves into the origins of the Lorentz transformations, demonstrating that they can be derived from broader principles, specifically the notion that certain mechanical laws remain invariant over time. Viewed from this broader perspective, the Lorentz transformations represent a specific case that can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. The text then presents an example from special relativity involving an observer measuring the speed of light from two different inertial frames. This scenario illustrates the necessity of considering both the spatial and temporal aspects of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light depends on both. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change in reference frame, affecting how clocks in different moving frames synchronize. Consequently, by defining the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can derive the corresponding temporal change. The latter part of the article generalizes this example to two inertial reference frames in relative motion, leading to a phenomenon known as the Relativistic Doppler effect. This situation again requires an examination of both the spatial and temporal elements of the Lorentz transformations. The discussion then addresses the scenario where observers in the two frames agree that light travels at a constant speed, regardless of their relative motion. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations simplifies to a transformation rule for the frequency of light, which can be interpreted as a conventional method for relating the observers' respective reference frames when they are in motion relative to one another.",

We consider only linear cosmological perturbations and we focus on the case of a constant equation of state, W=0.

        "rewrite_text": "The velocity of the universe remains uncertain. One of the most widely accepted explanations for this phenomenon is dark energy, which can be characterized by a cosmological constant or a dynamic form known as quintessence. Currently, available data does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. However, with sufficient information regarding the universe's evolution, such discrimination becomes feasible. Our analysis focuses on linear cosmological perturbations, specifically examining the case of a constant equation of state, W = 0. We find that if W remains constant and is clearly defined for more than 50% of the universe's age, it is relatively straightforward to differentiate between the two scenarios. Conversely, if the equation of state is variable, or if its precision is low, distinguishing between the two becomes impossible. Additionally, if W is constant but not sufficiently close to zero, or if it fluctuates significantly, discrimination is only possible for values of W near -1. We propose that distinguishing between a cosmological constant and quintessence is feasible when the equation of state is constant and notably different from -1. While this finding does not confirm that dark energy is definitively a cosmological constant or quintessence, it does impose certain constraints on these scenarios. Generally, it is challenging to differentiate between two dark energy models if their behaviors are nearly identical. However, assuming a constant equation of state for dark energy allows for the possibility of distinguishing between a cosmological constant and quintessence using current data. Future research with more precise data would be valuable to determine whether this assumption is necessary.

Traditionally, the access to the channel outputs is spatially separated at two or more places in the paper, called domain. Domain separation has two drawbacks: first, the channel capacity increases with the number of domains and the code becomes less useful in practice; second, if the channel outputs are ordered according to some predefined pattern, the code becomes easy to interpret and not very difficult to decode. In this paper, we consider the first drawback and show that if the desired number of outputs is a prime number, one can find a nice subset of the field of prime order and a prime factor of a Mersenne number for the channel outputs. This allows to decrease the number of domains to one, and provides a code that is efficiently realizable in practice. We also provide lower bounds on the size of LDC that answer an open question.",

Typically, the channel outputs are divided spatially at two or more points, referred to as domains. This domain separation presents two main issues: first, the channel capacity increases with the number of domains, making the code more complex and less practical; second, if the channel outputs follow a specific arrangement, the code becomes easier to understand and decode. In this paper, we address the first issue and demonstrate that when the desired number of outputs is a prime number, it is possible to identify a suitable subset from the field of prime order and a prime factor of a Mersenne number for the channel outputs. This approach allows us to reduce the number of domains to one, resulting in a code that can be efficiently implemented in practice.

In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",

        "rewrite_text": "Massive objects at high redshift (z ~ 2) are believed to contribute to the formation of the large structures observed in the local universe. In this study, we leverage the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to investigate the physical processes occurring in the largest galaxies during these early epochs. Our findings indicate that the primary mode of galaxy formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, which contrasts with the prevailing assumptions based on studies of local galaxies. More specifically, we observe a periodic increase in the specific star formation rate of large galaxies from z = 2 to the present, accompanied by a decline in the ratio of recent to past average star formation rates and galaxy sizes. We propose that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model where star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without altering their developmental pathways. We suggest that the mechanisms governing the star formation rates in the largest galaxies at these high redshifts differ from those in contemporary galaxies. Although this mode of galaxy formation is inefficient, it plays a crucial role in the evolution of the massive clusters we observe in the local universe. Furthermore, this growth is not uniform; massive galaxies expand through the accretion of companions and smooth (wet) mergers, with both processes contributing similarly. This dry merging is sufficient to account for the known size evolution of large galaxies. Our observations also clarify the correlation between galaxy formation and star formation: as galaxies grow through dry merging, the development of their brightest central regions outpaces that of their outer regions. These data may help address several longstanding questions regarding the early growth of large galaxies. Notably, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies primarily evolved through dry merging over much of their lifetimes, which supports the observed correlation between galaxy formation and star formation. Additionally, our findings indicate that massive galaxies at high redshift were not primarily experiencing downsizing in their star formation, as might be inferred from reports of prolonged aggressive star formation in some high-redshift galaxies. Instead, we propose that the observed variations in the physical processes and rates of galaxy formation in contemporary large galaxies compared to those in the largest galaxies at high redshifts may be influenced by the significantly longer timescales since the peak of past dry merging. While the specifics of these changes remain a topic of considerable debate, our results underscore the significance of early growth through dry merging in understanding the formation of present-day galaxy groups.",
