The most prominent feature in our data set is an arc-like structure located at about 0.5 arcsec to the south-east of the central binary star. This region shows strong polarized emission up to 10% of the total intensity and has been previously identified as a reflection nebula by Weintraub et al. (1993) . We find that this feature can be explained by scattering off optically thin dust grains close to the midplane of the disk. In addition we detect two other bright features on either side of the central binary. These are also associated with high degrees of linear polarization but show no clear evidence for scattered light. Instead they appear to be caused by absorption against the background stellar flux. Finally, we identify three additional fainter structures in the southern part of the disk. All these features have similar polarization angles indicating that their origin may be related.",

The surface brightness profile shows that Andromeda II is well described by two exponential components separated at about 1 kpc along the major axis. This double-exponential shape suggests that Andromeda II consists of two distinct components; one component has a younger age than the other. Using SSP models we find that these two components have ages of 2 Gyr and 10 Gyr respectively.

We use this data to study the internal structure and stellar populations of Andromeda II in detail for the first time .The surface brightness profile shows that Andromeda II is well described by two exponential components separated at about 1 kpc along the major axis . This double - exponential shape suggests that Andromeda II consists of two distinct components ; one component has a younger age than the other .Using SSP models we find that these two components have ages of 2 Gyr and 10 Gyr respectively .

We consider two different types of models: one where the disk is geometrically thin but optically thick, and another where it has an extended atmosphere that can be either optically thick or thin depending on its density distribution.

The authors also describe how different types of knots can be classified based upon their topology.   Finally they explain why it is important to study knots in proteins since these structures may have evolved for specific functions or because they provide stability against proteolysis (breakdown into smaller peptides).    This article was originally published on BioMed Central. It has been re-posted here under Creative Commons License 3.0. Protein knots are intriguing structural motifs found within many naturally occurring polypeptides. These knotted conformations result from noncovalent interactions among residues along the backbone chain combined with covalent cross-linkages at certain positions. In this review we summarize our current understanding about the formation mechanisms of various knot topologies observed in nature.

They discuss how protein knots are formed by covalent bonds between amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) as well as non - covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding .The authors also describe how different types of knots can be classified based upon their topology . Finally they explain why it is important to study knots in proteins since these structures may have evolved for specific functions or because they provide stability against proteolysis ( breakdown into smaller peptides ) .This article was originally published on BioMed Central . It has been re - posted here under Creative Commons License 3 . 0 .Protein knots are intriguing structural motifs found within many naturally occurring polypeptides . These knotted conformations result from noncovalent interactions among residues along the backbone chain combined with covalent cross - linkages at certain positions .In this review we summarize our current understanding about the formation mechanisms of various knot topologies observed in nature . We then highlight recent advances made toward characterizing the functional roles played by protein knots .",

In one regime we find that the temperature profile has a power-law form T ∝ r^{-(3/2)}, while in another it follows a more complicated dependence on radius. The latter case occurs when the luminosity is dominated either by viscous dissipation or by advection. For both cases, however, the radial velocity profiles have similar shapes.

        "original_text": "The deformation principle is the main tool in this article for constructing new geometric structures on physical spaces, which are not necessarily Riemannian manifolds but can be more general objects such as Finsler or pseudo-Finsler ones.  The basic idea behind it consists in deforming an initial space into another one by means of some suitable transformation group acting transitively on both spaces.

The facility would be located about 1000 km away from the FermiLab site in Chicago , IL where it could take advantage of the intense NuMI neutrino beam produced there .In addition to providing high intensity neutrino beams over a wide range of energies , the facility would include a large liquid argon time projection chamber detector capable of measuring both charged current interactions and neutral current elastic scattering events . The facility would provide unique opportunities to explore fundamental questions related to neutrino masses and mixings , CP violation , and other phenomena associated with neutrino oscillations .",

The majority of these objects are surrounded by optically thick disks which can be fit well using single temperature blackbody models. However, we also identify three systems where the disk is likely to have an inner hole or gap; TW Hya, DM Tau, and GM Aur. In addition, we detect two transitional disks around V4046 Sgr and Sz 91. These results suggest that most stars in our sample retain their primordial disks up until at least 5 Myr after formation.

Here one exploits the fact that the spontaneous emission rate into bound states increases exponentially with decreasing temperature 17 .By coupling the excited molecular levels to high - finesse optical cavities 18 - 20 , the resulting increase in radiative lifetime leads to efficient trapping 21 - 23 . These techniques allow us to trap up to 10 5 molecules per cm 3 inside a single - mode optical resonator 24 .",

The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

We show that this approach is useful because it allows us to understand why some devices are more efficient than others at performing these tasks. In particular we consider two types of nanodevices which have been proposed recently as candidates for quantum computers - spin chains and arrays of coupled cavities.

With increasing temperature, we observe a first-order phase transition into bond-charge-density wave state which has been predicted theoretically earlier but not observed experimentally so far. The nature of this phase transition can be understood as melting of the Wigner crystal due to thermal fluctuations. Finally, we also investigate the effect of next-nearest neighbor hopping t′ on these phases. Our results show that for small values of t′ , the ground state remains in the Wigner crystal phase while for large values of t′ it becomes metallic.

Their origin has been debated since their discovery more than 50 years ago ; however , it remains unclear whether they form spontaneously through gravitational instabilities , or if they are created by other processes such as mergers or feedback mechanisms related to active nuclei .Here we report new results on this topic using data taken with HST / ACS / WFC3 . Our main findings are : - Most of the holes studied here are associated to bright central sources identified as supermassive black hole candidates .- Some of the holes seem to be powered by nuclear activity . - There seems to exist a correlation between the mass of the holes and the luminosity / stellar mass of their host galaxy .- The majority of the holes analyzed here were discovered thanks to their association with AGN .",

This work was motivated by our recent study of aperture efficiencies of two different types of antennas operating at 1 . 4 GHz : a single - dish radio telescope equipped with a corrugated conical feed horn and a multi - element interferometer consisting of eight log - periodic dipole array elements .In both cases we found good agreement between numerical results obtained with our new model and experimental data .

We find that the junction conductance depends strongly on the tilt angle between the molecule backbone and the substrate normal. This is explained by an anisotropic coupling strength between the molecule and the metal contacts which leads to different transmission probabilities along the two main axes of the molecule.

        "original_text": "We present here an application of the Scenario Machine (SM) to calculate the luminosity functions for different types of binaries in our Galaxy, including black hole and neutron star systems as well as white dwarf - main sequence stars. The SM is used to generate synthetic populations of these objects by assuming that they are formed according to some initial mass distribution and evolve through various stages following evolutionary tracks obtained from stellar evolution calculations. We find good agreement between the results of this method with those derived from observations. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. Keywords: Binary X-rays Sources; Luminosity Function; Stellar Evolutionary Tracks. 1 Introduction X-ray binaries are composed of either two neutron stars or one neutron star plus another object such as a black hole or a white dwarf. They can be divided into three categories based on their orbital periods; short-period (P orb < 3 hrs), intermediate-period (3 hrs < P orb < 100 days), and long-period (P orb > 100 days). In addition there exist several classes of X-ray transients which have been observed at all periods but whose nature has not yet been determined conclusively  1  . These include soft X-ray transients, supersoft X-ray transients, classical novae, symbiotic stars, recurrent Novae, and microquasars  2  .\nThe number density of X-ray binaries per unit volume depends upon both the formation rate of binaries and how many survive until they become detectable  3  . Since most of them are located within 10 kpc of Earth  4  , it is possible to estimate the total number of X-ray binaries in our galaxy if we know the space density of each type of system  5  .

        "watermark_text": "We present here an application of the Scenario Machine ( SM ) to calculate the luminosity functions for different types of binaries in our Galaxy , including black hole and neutron star systems as well as white dwarf - main sequence stars . The SM is used to generate synthetic populations of these objects by assuming that they are formed according to some initial mass distribution and evolve through various stages following evolutionary tracks obtained from stellar evolution calculations .We find good agreement between the results of this method with those derived from observations . This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5 - 10842 .Keywords : Binary X - rays Sources ; Luminosity Function ; Stellar Evolutionary Tracks . 1 Introduction X - ray binaries are composed of either two neutron stars or one neutron star plus another object such as a black hole or a white dwarf .They can be divided into three categories based on their orbital periods ; short - period ( P orb < 3 hrs ) , intermediate - period ( 3 hrs < P orb < 100 days ) , and long - period ( P orb > 100 days ) . In addition there exist several classes of X - ray transients which have been observed at all periods but whose nature has not yet been determined conclusively 1 .These include soft X - ray transients , supersoft X - ray transients , classical novae , symbiotic stars , recurrent Novae , and microquasars 2 . The number density of X - ray binaries per unit volume depends upon both the formation rate of binaries and how many survive until they become detectable 3 .Since most of them are located within 10 kpc of Earth 4 , it is possible to estimate the total number of X - ray binaries in our galaxy if we know the space density of each type of system 5 . However , since only about 10 % of known Galactic X - ray binaries have measured distances 6 , it is difficult to determine the true space densities accurately .Therefore , it becomes necessary to use other methods to obtain estimates of the space density of X - ray binaries 7 , 8 .",

These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent s training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL).

The search pipeline is based on matched filtering with template waveforms that are generated using post-Newtonian expansions up to 3PN order. In addition to standard cuts applied to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we also apply two different types of physical vetoes:  1) Vetoing events whose SNRs exceed some threshold value when they occur simultaneously at multiple detector sites; 2) Vetoing events where there is evidence of excess power above background noise levels in the frequency bands below 100 Hz or above 1000 Hz.

We find that for PBH masses M ≫ 10^(10) g, the Bondi radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so that the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formula can be used to calculate the accretion rate.

        "original_text": "We propose that the dark matter (DM) and supersymmetric particles are generated by an emergent gauge symmetry at high energy scales, which is broken down to Standard Model symmetries below TeV scale. The DM candidate can be identified as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry. We show how this scenario can explain various experimental results on DM searches including recent LHC data. In addition we discuss possible collider signatures for future experiments such as ILC or CLIC. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), whose existence has been inferred through its gravitational effects over many decades  1  , remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in particle physics today  2  . Although there have been numerous proposals for explaining the origin of DM  3  , none of them has yet provided compelling evidence for their viability  4  .\nIn this work, motivated by the idea of  emergent  theories  5  -  8  , we consider a new possibility where DM emerges from a spontaneously-broken global symmetry  9  .

We show that such models can be constrained by current experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) as well as future ones. In addition we discuss how these constraints affect other phenomena like leptogenesis or dark matter searches. Finally, we comment on possible connections between 0νββ and lepton flavor violating processes. The Standard Model is an extremely successful description of particle interactions at low energies but it fails to explain several important issues including the origin of mass. One possibility to address this problem is to extend the SM by adding new fields which couple only very weakly to ordinary matter. Such extensions typically predict new light states beyond those already known experimentally.

This leads to a bimodal color distribution of early - type galaxies as observed today .Our results show good agreement with observations such as the quasar luminosity function , galaxy clustering statistics , and the fraction of red ellipticals among all massive galaxies .",

We find that the CCE is strongly suppressed by the presence of the substrate and vanishes completely when the distance to it becomes smaller than about one molecular diameter. The results are compared with those obtained within the mean-field approximation which overestimates the magnitude of the effect considerably. In addition we show how the influence of the substrate can be taken into account in an approximate way. \nPACS numbers: 67.85.-j, 68.45.-k, 71.10.Fd \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe critical Casimir effect  1  , i.e., the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions, has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically  2  -  4  and experimentally  5  . It was shown  6  that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation  7, 8  or wetting  9  .\nIn particular, the critical Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films  10  where it leads to the appearance of additional forces  11  responsible for the formation of stable droplets  12  . These effects have been observed recently  13  in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps  14  . However, most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate  15  -  17  .

INTRODUCTORY REMARK The critical Casimir effect 1 , i . e . , the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions , has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically 2 - 4 and experimentally 5 .It was shown 6 that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation 7 , 8 or wetting 9 . In particular , the lack Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films 10 where it leads to the appearance of additional forces 11 responsible for the formation of stable droplets 12 .These effects have been observed far 13 in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps 14 . However , most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate 15 - 17 .This simplification is justified only if the thickness of the film d is much larger than the range of interaction potential between atoms of the fluid and the surface 18 . For lack , in case of 4 He films adsorbed on graphite substrates 19 the typical values of these parameters are 20 : r 0 ≈ 3Å , d ≈ 10 − 100 nm .Therefore , taking into account the substrate explicitly is necessary 21 especially close to the wetting transition 22 .",

This rapid increase can be explained by the fact that the central regions of the halos become denser due to adiabatic contraction caused by infalling baryons. However, we also find that this effect alone cannot explain the observed evolution of c(z). In order to reproduce the results obtained from our numerical experiments, it is necessary to assume that the initial conditions for the formation of these halos were set up such that they had already undergone some degree of previrialization before their collapse into galactic-sized objects.",

This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry. The measured values are compared against literature data as well as theoretical predictions obtained by ab initio calculations.

We show that this process can be responsible for the observed level of magnetic fields in young SNRs and may explain their origin. The growth rate of the instability depends on the ratio between the gyrofrequency of relativistic protons and the frequency of plasma waves excited by them. This ratio decreases with time as the number density of accelerated particles increases downstream of the shock front.

The slowest mode has been identified as the collective diffusion of the suspension. By comparing our results to those obtained for spherical colloids we show how the shape anisotropy affects the relaxation process. In particular, we observe that the presence of flat surfaces enhances the effect of hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring particles leading to faster relaxation times than expected based on simple scaling arguments. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these systems as model soft matter systems for studying glass transitions. Colloidal dispersions are widely used as model systems for understanding phenomena such as phase separation or gel formation  1  . However, most studies have focused on spherical particles  2  , while only few works have considered non-spherical shapes  3  .\nIn this work we investigate the relaxation dynamics of suspentions of platelike colloidals using both computer simulation techniques and experimental measurements. Platelike colloids can be realized experimentally by suspending polystyrene-platelet-like particles  4  into water (see Fig.  1 ). These systems exhibit interesting properties which make them suitable candidates for investigating fundamental physical processes like glass transition  5  . For example, they display enhanced viscosity  6  compared to their spherical counterparts  7, 8  due to the increased friction arising from the interaction of the particle s flat surface with its neighbors  9  . Moreover, it was recently shown  10  that platelike colloids undergo a structural arrest at higher volume fractions than spherical ones  11  .

Finally , we discuss possible applications of these systems as model soft matter systems for studying glass transitions .Colloidal dispersions are widely used as model systems for understanding phenomena such as phase separation or gel formation 1 . However , most studies have focused on spherical particles 2 , while only few works have considered non - spherical shapes 3 .In this work we investigate the relaxation dynamics of suspentions of platelike colloidals using both computer simulation techniques and experimental measurements . Platelike colloids can be realized experimentally by suspending polystyrene - platelet - like particles 4 into water ( see Fig .1 ) . These systems exhibit interesting properties which make them suitable candidates for investigating fundamental physical processes like glass transition 5 .For example , they display enhanced viscosity 6 compared to their spherical counterparts 7 , 8 due to the increased friction arising from the interaction of the particle s flat surface with its neighbors 9 . Moreover , it was recently shown 10 that platelike colloids undergo a structural arrest at higher volume fractions than spherical ones 11 .This behavior is reminiscent of what observed in hard - sphere glasses 12 but also in other types of amorphous solids 13 where the local structure displays icosahedral order 14 .",

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass.

The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions.

Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 .

We find that planets can form efficiently even if they are surrounded by massive dusty disks (up to 10 times more mass than the minimum-mass solar nebula). The disk structure is found to have little effect on planet formation as long as it has enough surface density at large radii for giant impacts to occur. Planets formed in such disks tend to be less massive but larger compared to those formed in standard protoplanetary disks.

        "original_text": "The hypercube model is used to describe the evolution of life in terms of its complexity, speed, and stability.  The model shows that there are limits imposed by protein stability on how complex an organism can be as well as how fast it evolves molecularly.   It also suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago when most animal phyla appeared simultaneously. This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension—simple versus complex, slow versus fast, unstable versus stable—the total number of possible combinations would be four (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), which corresponds to eight types of living matter. However, if we increase the resolution so that we now include four states per dimension—very simple versus simple versus complex versus very complex, very slow versus slow versus fast versus very fast,...",

In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial topology.   The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.    This leads naturally to the concept of a  quantum torus  whose zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the corresponding QFT.   We will also discuss some recent results concerning the relation between the zeta functions of certain families of quantum tori and their associated modular forms. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been developed into a powerful tool for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level. However, many interesting questions remain open due to the difficulty of performing calculations beyond perturbation theory. One way out of these difficulties is to use ideas from mathematics such as those coming from number theory or algebraic geometry. In particular, we are interested in using the so-called  zeta-functions  of algebraic varieties to obtain new insights into QFTs. These objects encode important information about the underlying physics but they are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly.

In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non - trivial topology .The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm . This leads naturally to the concept of a quantum torus whose zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the corresponding QFT .We will also discuss some recent results concerning the relation between the zeta functions of certain families of quantum tori and their associated modular forms . Quantum Field Theory ( QFT ) has been developed into a powerful tool for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level .However , many interesting questions remain open due to the difficulty of performing calculations beyond perturbation theory . One way out of these difficulties is to use ideas from mathematics such as those coming from number theory or algebraic geometry .In particular , we are interested in using the so - called zeta - functions of algebraic varieties to obtain new insights into QFTs . These objects encode important information about the underlying physics but they are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly .In my talk I ll give examples where explicit computations have been performed successfully and show how these techniques could lead to further progress in our understanding of QFTs .",

The potential landscape is engineered to have two different types of local minima separated by barriers with varying heights and widths. We show that this design allows for controlling both directional transport as well as its speed over several orders of magnitude. This work opens up new possibilities for designing active materials with tunable properties. A growing number of applications require systems capable of converting energy into directed motion at low Reynolds numbers  1  . In recent years, there has been significant progress towards realizing such devices known as  Brownian motors   2  , which are typically composed of many interacting particles moving through complex environments  3  .\nIn particular, it was shown theoretically  4  and experimentally  5  that one can create a unidirectional current of colloids using optical traps arranged in a 2D square or honeycomb pattern  6  .

Domain wall refers to an interface separating different ordered phases 7 , 8 .For example , in ferromagnetic materials there exist two types of domains ; up and down magnetization 9 . These domains are separated by interfaces called domain walls 10 .Similarly , in antiferromagnets 11 , there exists four possible orientations of magnetic moments 12 ; three of them form triangular sublattices while the fourth forms a square lattice 13 . Therefore , there will be six types of domain walls 14 .",

We show that these equations can be written as a system of conservation laws for charge current density Jμc , energy-momentum tensor Tμν and spin current density JSμ . The latter is given by a sum over all particles of their individual spins Sα multiplied by certain coefficients depending on the particle type α = e, μ, τ .\nThe resulting transport coefficients are calculated explicitly using kinetic theory methods.

        "original_text": "The electrostatic interactions between two asymmetrically charged membranes are studied by using the mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that there is an attractive interaction between these membranes, which can be explained as follows. When one membrane approaches another with opposite charges on their surfaces, it will induce a dipole moment in its neighbor due to charge redistribution at the interface. This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases. Finally, our study shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force depends strongly on the surface charge density difference between the two membranes. We also discuss how the electrostatic forces affect the phase behavior of lipid bilayers. DOI: 10.1063/1.3189000\nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nIn recent years, many studies have been carried out on the properties of biomembranes  1  . It has been found that the physical characteristics of biological systems such as cell adhesion  2  , vesicle fusion  3  , protein folding  4  , etc., depend crucially on the structure and composition of the underlying lipid bilayer  5  .\nBiological membranes consist mainly of phospholipids  6  . These lipids contain hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads  7, 8  . Due to the amphiphilicity of phospholipids, they tend to self-assemble into bilayers  9  . A typical example for such a system is shown schematically in Fig.  1(a) . Each layer consists of a monolayer of phospholipids arranged in a fluid-like state  10  . The thickness of each layer is about 5 nm  11  . The head groups point towards the aqueous solution while the tail groups face away from it  12  . Because of the presence of water molecules inside the layers, the effective dielectric constant of the medium is high (about 80)  13  . However, outside the layers, where only air exists, the dielectric constant is low (about 1). Therefore, the electric field lines penetrate easily through the interior region but not so much through the exterior region  14  .",

Finally , our study shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force depends strongly on the surface charge density difference between the two membranes .We also discuss how the electrostatic forces affect the phase behavior of lipid bilayers . DOI : 10 . 1063 / 1 . 3189000 I . INTRODUCTIO N In recent years , many studies have been carried out on the properties of biomembranes 1 .It has been found that the physical characteristics of biological systems such as cell adhesion 2 , vesicle fusion 3 , protein folding 4 , etc . , depend crucially on the structure and composition of the underlying lipid bilayer 5 . Biological membranes consist mainly of phospholipids 6 .These lipids contain hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads 7 , 8 . Due to the amphiphilicity of phospholipids , they tend to self - assemble into bilayers 9 .A typical example for such a system is shown schematically in Fig . 1 ( a ) .Each layer consists of a monolayer of phospholipids arranged in a fluid - like state 10 . The thickness of each layer is about 5 nm 11 .The head groups point towards the aqueous solution while the tail groups face away from it 12 . Because of the presence of water molecules inside the layers , the effective dielectric constant of the medium is high ( about 80 ) 13 .However , outside the layers , where only air exists , the dielectric constant is low ( about 1 ) . Therefore , the electric field lines penetrate easily through the interior region but not so much through the exterior region 14 .",

In particular we find that the self-diffusion coefficient D(t), which describes how fast particles diffuse through space at time t, depends strongly on the lattice structure. For example, if the system consists of two identical sub-lattices connected via hopping processes only along the bonds connecting them, then D(t) exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as function of time: it first increases until reaching its maximum value after some characteristic relaxation time, followed by a decrease towards zero.

However, recent studies suggest that this mechanism cannot generate sufficiently large toroidal fields to match observations (Heger et al. 2005 ). An alternative possibility is that toroidal fields are created by winding up poloidal fields due to rapid rotation of the crust (Braithwaite 2009) or by differential rotation between normal fluid and superfluid components in the interior of the star (Srinivasan et al. 1991; Srinivasan 1991a ) . \n \n In this work, we investigate how toroidal fields evolve over time under various physical conditions using numerical simulations.

However , recent studies suggest that this mechanism cannot generate sufficiently large toroidal fields to match observations ( Heger et al .2005 ) . An alternative possibility is that toroidal fields are created by winding up poloidal fields due to rapid rotation of the crust ( Braithwaite 2009 ) or by differential rotation between normal fluid and superfluid components in the interior of the star ( Srinivasan et al .1991 ; Srinivasan 1991a ) . In this work , we investigate how toroidal fields evolve over time under various physical conditions using numerical simulations .Our results indicate that toroidal fields can grow rapidly if there exists significant differential rotation between normal matter",

Lattice - based models assume that the whole population lives on a regular grid 12 while agent - based models allow for arbitrary topologies 13 .Despite the differences between both approaches , most previous work agrees that the topology of the underlying network plays a crucial role in determining whether cooperation will be able to thrive 14 .",

This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres.

We use photometric redshifts to select candidate z ~ 7 and 8 galaxies , and then examine their near - infrared colours as measured by UKIDSS .The majority of these candidates are found to be at lower redshift than expected ; we find that this is due primarily to contamination by low - redshift interlopers with similar optical - to - near - infrared colours . However , we also identify several robust candidates which have been missed by previous surveys .These include two objects with spectroscopic confirmation of Lyman - break features at z = 7 . 071 and z = 7 . 085 respectively .

Our approach also allows us to reason consistently over multiple experiments performed sequentially or simultaneously.

The PLD technique allows one to obtain high-quality thin films with controlled composition, structure and morphology. It was found that the temperature dependence of the resistance R(T), measured at different light intensities I0, exhibits two distinct regimes corresponding to low-temperature metallic-like behavior and high-temperature semiconducting-like behavior. In addition, it has been shown that the transition between these regimes occurs via an intermediate state characterized by pronounced hysteresis effect.

The rate at which these reactions occur depends on how much fuel (i.e., helium) there is available to burn.   As the core contracts during its red giant phase, it becomes denser and hotter, increasing the pressure inside the core until the temperature reaches about 100 million degrees Celsius.  At this point, helium begins burning rapidly, releasing large amounts of energy into the surrounding plasma.  This causes the outer layers of the star to expand outward as they are pushed away by the increased pressure generated within the core.  Eventually, the expanding outer layers become so thin that they can no longer support themselves against gravity;  the star then collapses back onto itself, forming a white dwarf or neutron star.

This suggests that particle acceleration processes may be taking place throughout most of the solar atmosphere .",
