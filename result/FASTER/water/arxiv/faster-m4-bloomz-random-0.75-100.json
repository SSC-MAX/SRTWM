We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows.

We show that this extension allows us to reproduce simultaneously several features observed experimentally or theoretically in nuclear physics such as: i) saturation of nuclear matter; ii) appearance of hyperon resonances; iii) restoration of chiral symmetry at finite baryonic densities; iv) existence of a critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. In addition we find that our results agree well with recent lattice simulations performed within the framework of the PNJL model.

Abstract : We present an effective model to study the properties of dense quark matter in the presence of large strange quarks masses , which are relevant for compact stars with high central density .The model is based on the Nambu - Jona - Lasinio ( NJL ) Lagrangian extended by including vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom . We show that this extension allows us to reproduce simultaneously several features observed experimentally or theoretically in nuclear physics such as : i ) saturation of nuclear matter ; ii ) appearance of hyperon resonances ; iii ) restoration of chiral symmetry at finite baryonic densities ; iv ) existence of a critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .In addition we find that our results agree well with recent lattice simulations performed within the framework of the PNJL model .

The target is the F-type main-sequence star kappa 1 Cet (HD 128898), which has been observed in two consecutive runs during 2005-2006. We find that the surface shear rate decreases towards lower latitudes, but increases again at mid-latitudes. This behaviour can be explained if we assume that there are two differentially rotating regions on opposite sides of the equator. In addition to this large-scale pattern, we also detect smaller-scale features such as spots and plages. These structures appear to have lifetimes between one week and several months.

The DGC consists of several proteins including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin.   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding for dystrophin lead to loss of this protein from the sarcolemma resulting in severe muscle wasting.  However, it has been shown that expression of utrophin can compensate for the absence of dystrophin by binding to other components of the DGC such as alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG).  This study investigated whether processing of beta-dystroglycan affects its ability to bind with utrophin or its homologous counterpart, dp116, using normal mouse Schwann cells (MSC) and mdx mice lacking functional dystrophin.  Beta-dystroglycan was found to be processed into two different forms in both MSCs and mdx sciatic nerves.  One form had a molecular weight similar to that observed in normal mouse brain tissue while another form showed higher mobility when compared to the first one.  Both forms were able to interact with utrophin but only the lower molecular weight form could also bind to dp116.  These results suggest that processing of betadystroglycan may affect its interaction with utrophin and/or dp116.",

To help us learn more about them , physicists at MIT used lattice quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) , a technique similar to those employed in high energy experiments but performed on computers instead of accelerators , to predict the behavior of certain nuclear reactions .Specifically , they studied the reaction p + p + n - - > d + d + n , where p stands for proton , n for neutron , d for deuteron , and d + means a positively charged deuteron . Their calculations were based on . . .",

The results show that there are significant differences in the IM plasma pressure profiles obtained with different satellites. In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system. This suggests that the observed difference in the pressure profiles can be attributed mainly to the spatial variation of the pressure rather than temporal changes.",

We find that RT can significantly enhance the strength of the 21 cm signal by up to an order of magnitude compared to calculations neglecting RT effects. The enhancement is caused mainly by Lyman-alpha photons produced inside galaxies which are absorbed outside them due to scattering off neutral hydrogen atoms. This leads to additional heating of the intergalactic medium through photoionization heating and Compton cooling. In addition we show that the inclusion of RT also changes the shape of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that future radio telescopes such as SKA will be able to detect this signal if they have sufficient sensitivity.

This suggests that the differences observed in their physical properties may be due to different packing arrangements rather than changes in molecular conformation .",

We show how this scenario could explain several puzzling observations in astrophysics and cosmology. In particular we argue that: (i) The observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are explained by the presence of a halo of cold dark matter surrounding each galaxy. (ii) The formation of large-scale structures such as clusters of galaxies proceeds through gravitational collapse of overdensities in the primordial density field seeded by quantum fluctuations during inflation. (iii) Dark energy may arise naturally if the universe contains a large number of weakly interacting massive particles with masses around $10^{22}$ GeV. This article is part of a series on Quantum Matter. For more information see http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604070 . \nIntroduction:  Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict new types of elementary particles whose existence has yet to be confirmed experimentally.

We show how this scenario could explain several puzzling observations in astrophysics and cosmology .In particular we argue that : ( i ) The observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are explained by the presence of a halo of cold dark matter surrounding each galaxy . ( ii ) The formation of large - scale structures such as clusters of galaxies proceeds through gravitational collapse of overdensities in the primordial density field seeded by quantum fluctuations during inflation .( iii ) Dark energy may arise naturally if the universe contains a large number of weakly interacting massive particles with masses around $ 10 ^ { 22 } $ GeV .

We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved. In particular, if the UED scale is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies.

Abstract : We study the relic density of dark matter ( DM ) produced by thermal freeze - out and freezein processes in Universal Extra Dimension ( UED ) model , where we include effects due to Majorana mass terms for the right handed neutrino fields .We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved .

We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions. This suggests that the apparent constancy of loop widths may be due to averaging effects rather than being intrinsic properties of coronal structures.

We show that for certain classes of potentials there are regions where trajectories can be trapped by unstable fixed points or periodic orbits.
