I d be happy to assist you understand how to manually calculate the subnet mask of a network .First , let s start with the basics . A subnet mask is a 32 - bit number that is applied to divide a network into tiny subnetworks , or subnets .It operates by separating the IP address of a device into two parts : the channel component and the host portion . The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host .Now , let s say you want to create subnets for a network with the IP address range 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . To do this , you need to choose how many subnets you want to create and how many clients you want on each subnet .For instance , let s say you want to create 4 subnets , each with 16 hosts . To estimate the subnet mask , you might do the following : Write down the number of subnets and hosts in binary form .In this instance , you want 4 subnets , so you might write 100 in binary . You get 16 hosts , so you might write 10000 in binary .Add the two binary numbers together . In this instance , the sum is 100010000 .Convert the binary number to decimal form . To do this , you might multiply each digit by the respective power of 2 and increase the results .In this instance , the decimal form of the binary number is 320 . Write down the IP address range in dot - decimal notation .In this instance , the IP address range is 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . Add the subnet mask to the IP address .To do this , you might mix the subnet mask ( 320 ) with the IP address utilizing dot - decimal notation . The resulting IP address might be 192 . 168 . 1 . 320 .This is the fundamental process for determining the subnet mask of a network . I pray this helps to explain the idea !Let me know if you have any concerns or want further clarification ."}]}}

Sigmund Freud was an Austrian physician and neurologist who is known for his concepts about the psychological composition of the human mind .According to Freud , the human mind is separated into three components : the id , the ego , and the superego .

The ego is the part of the mind that is responsible for our conscious ideas and actions .It is the part of the mind that helps us to deal with reality and making decisions based on what is practical and realistic . The superego is the part of the mind that is responsible for our sense of wrong and wrong , and our moral standards .It is the part of the mind that helps us to command our impulses and making decisions based on what is morally right .

Let s start by talking about what a light year is .A light year is a unit of distance that is equal to how far light can travel in one year . Light is a kind of power that travels through space and it is the fastest thing in the universe .It can travel at a speed of about 300 , 000 km per second , which is really fast ! Now , let s discuss about galaxies .A galaxy is a huge group of stars , gas , and dust that are held together by gravitational . There are billions of stars in the universe , and each one is really far back from us .In reality , some stars are so close away that it takes a long time for their light to reach us . When we glance at a galaxy that is far back , we are finally seeing it as it was a long time previously .This is because it takes a long time for the light from that galaxy to reach us . So , if we saw a galaxy that is 30 billion light years distance , it means that it taking 30 billion decades for the light from that galaxy to reach us .But the universe is only about 16 billion days old , so how can we view a galaxy that is 30 billion light years distance ? The answer is that the universe is constantly expanding .This implies that the distance between galaxies is got bigger all the time . As the space between galaxies gets big , the distance between them also gets big .This implies that even though the universe might not be 30 billion light years back from us now , it was when the light left the universe and began moving towards us .

It really depends on your individual circumstances .If you don t drive very lot , don t mind flipping the car in at the end of the rent , and don t have a lot of money saving up for a down payment , leasing might be a better choice for you .
