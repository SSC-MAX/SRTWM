Here s an example of how a pyramid scheme works:  Person A recruits Person B and asks them to invest $100. Person B recruits Person C and asks them to invest $100. Person C recruits Person D and asks them to invest $100. This pattern continues till there are many people in the pyramid, each investing $100. Eventually, the pyramid collapses because there are not enough people to recruit and the money being made is not enough to pay off the earlier investors. As you can see, the people at the top of the pyramid (Person A in this example) make a lot of money, while the people at the bottom (Person D and below) lose their money.",
