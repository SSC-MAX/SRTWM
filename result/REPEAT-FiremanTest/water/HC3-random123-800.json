This happens because the heat causes the molecules in the fuel to move faster and faster, until they are moving so fast that they can break free from the rest of the fuel and float away into the air. These molecules are called  combustion products,  and they are what give a flame its form.\n\nThe form of a flame depends on a few things, including the type of fuel that is burning and the amount of oxygen in the air. For example, a flame from a candle is made up of a wick surrounded by a thin, cone-shaped flame. The flame is mostly made of hot gases, and it is yellow or orange in color. This is because the wick is made of a type of fuel that burns relatively slowly and cleanly, and there is enough oxygen in the air for the flame to burn brightly. On the other hand, a flame from a fire that is burning wood or other solid fuels may be much larger and less defined, with a lot of flickering and movement. This is because the fuel is burning more quickly and there may be less oxygen available for the flame to burn.",
