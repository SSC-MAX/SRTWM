We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes.

In particular, if the UED scale is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies. The results are presented in the context of LHC searches for new physics beyond Standard Model. Introduction:-The discovery of the Higgs-like resonance  1-3  at Large Hadron Collider (LHC), alongwith other experimental evidences  4  , have established the existence of a fundamental scalar field responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry. However, there still remain many open questions about the nature of this scalar sector such as: What is its spin? Is it CP-even or odd? Does it couple only to gauge bosons or also to fermions?

The OPO consists of a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal as nonlinear medium and a concave mirror for cavity feedback. We show experimentally that this approach allows us to obtain high-visibility quantum interference between photons emitted at degenerate wavelength pairs across the entire PPLN acceptance bandwidth. This method can be used to simplify future experiments on continuous-variable entanglement distribution over large distances. \n \n Quantum information processing requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of light. In particular, the Bell state measurement plays a key role in many applications such as teleportation or quantum repeaters  1  . However, generating these highly nonclassical states is challenging because they require indistinguishable photon pairs  2  , which cannot be produced deterministically  3  .\nIn recent years, several approaches have been developed to overcome this problem  4  . One possibility is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), where a pump beam creates correlated pairs of signal and idler photons  5  .

By exploiting the strong magnetic dipole moment associated with the cesium ground state  15  , we observe a novel form of magneto-optical resonance  16  known as ground state magneto-optical resonance  17  .

The partition function is expressed as a functional integral over complex fields, which are related to the density matrix and current operators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We show that this formulation allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the time evolution of observables such as the occupation probabilities and currents through the junction between the leads and the central region. In particular we find that the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs via damped oscillations whose frequency depends on the bias voltage across the junction. This behavior can be understood within a simple rate equation approach.

        "original_text": "We study the evolution of age structure and life history traits by using an age-structured population model with stochastic demographic events, where individuals can reproduce at any age. We show that selection against demographic stochasticity leads to increased reproductive effort early in life (i.e., earlier reproduction) and decreased mortality rates later in life. This is because higher reproductive efforts increase offspring numbers but also lead to more deaths due to competition for resources among siblings. In contrast, lower mortality rates decrease sibling competition and thus reduce the number of deaths caused by this source of demographic stochasticity.

Our results are relevant to recent efforts aimed at realizing large-scale quantum computers using solid state devices such as semiconductor quantum dots or trapped ions. We also discuss possible extensions of this work to other types of quantum gates. The ability to perform arbitrary unitary transformations on a set of n qubits would constitute a quantum computer capable of solving problems exponentially faster than classical computers  1  .

        "original_text": "We study the dynamic properties of molecular motors by using burnt-bridge models, which are simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin V. We show that these models reproduce several experimental results on single-molecule experiments with high accuracy.  In particular, we find that the velocity distribution is well described by an exponential function at low load force but deviates from it when the load increases. The mean square displacement shows subdiffusive behavior under large loads. These behaviors can be explained by considering the effect of the elasticity of the cargoes carried by the motors. Our model also reproduces the dependence of stall forces on external viscous drag coefficients observed experimentally. Finally, our simulation results suggest that the number of steps taken per ATP hydrolysis cycle decreases exponentially with increasing load force. This result may explain why the step size fluctuation becomes larger than expected theoretically near stalling conditions. \nI.

Kinesins walk along microtubules toward their plus ends  7, 8  . Myosins move towards actin filaments  minus ends  9  . Both types of motors have been shown to take discrete steps  10 -12  . Recent studies have revealed that both kinesins  13  and myosins  14  exhibit stochastic stepping motions even without external loads  15 -19  . It has been suggested that this randomness arises mainly due to thermal fluctuations  20, 21  or internal noise  22  . However, there still remain open questions about how they respond to external loads  23  .\nIn order to understand the mechanism underlying the operation of molecular motors, various theoretical approaches have been developed so far  24  . Among those methods, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations  25  provide useful information on",

        "original_text": "We present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) .

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years much attention has been devoted to studying nonequilibrium steady states of driven lattice gases  1  . These models describe interacting particle systems evolving according to stochastic rules such that detailed balance cannot be satisfied globally  2  , but nevertheless they exhibit interesting macroscopic behavior  3  .\nOne class of these models consists of so-called exclusion processes  4  describing particles moving along a regular lattice under mutual exclusion constraints  5  . For example, consider a chain of L sites labeled by integers 1, ..., L, each occupied by either zero or one particle. Particles may jump to the right or left neighboring site provided it is empty  6  . If all jumps occur independently then the resulting Markov process satisfies detailed balance with respect to some product measure  7, 8  . However if the rates depend on the number of particles occupying adjacent sites  9  then detailed balance breaks down  10  . Despite this lack of equilibrium properties many of these models still display non-trivial features reminiscent of those observed in thermal equilibrium  11  .",

The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets.

In this work we present an analytical model which describes the process of magnetic reconnection in collisionless high energy plasma with arbitrary initial conditions. The main idea behind our approach consists in using the concept of generalized force density tensor (GDFT) introduced by MHD theory. We show that GDFT can be used not only to describe the macroscopic dynamics but also microscopic properties of the system like particle distribution functions. Our results are compared with those obtained within other approaches based on kinetic description of particles motion.

We find that the resistivity increases rapidly when the applied current exceeds some threshold value Ic(H), where H denotes the strength of the external magnetic field.

We also show how to find all possible circuits if they exist. Our results are based on recent work showing that any time-independent Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of commuting projectors onto its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to reduce the problem of finding a realization of a general time-independent Hamiltonian into several instances of the same problem but restricted to smaller Hilbert spaces. The reduction yields a polynomial-time algorithm when applied recursively. Finally we discuss some applications of our method including determining the minimum depth required for universal adiabatic quantum computers. In this article we consider the following problem: \nGiven a set of n qubits and m two-qubit gates, does there exist a quantum circuit consisting only of these gates whose associated time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable; i.e., it corresponds to a Hermitian operator acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space?

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe.

However, this fact does not necessarily mean that all possible configurations can appear as ground states  2  . For example, the ground states of the one-dimensional chain are unique although its energy spectrum is continuous  3  , while those of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate  4  . \n \n Recently, several authors studied the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest neighbor Ising model (AN-NNI)  5 - 7  . They showed numerically that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on the square lattices if J 1 = J 2 or J 1 < J 2  7   . On the other hand, the ground states were shown to be unique on the honeycomb lattice  8  . These results suggest that the ground states might be nondegenerate even though their exact forms remain unknown so far. \n \n In this Letter, we investigate the ground states of the ANNNI model using Monte Carlo simulations. First, we confirm that the ground states are indeed infinitely degenerate on the squarelattice ANNNI models. Then, we examine whether these ground states are unique or not.

In order to overcome this problem we propose an alternative model which reproduces all relevant physical quantities within their experimental uncertainty.

Instead, periodic boundary conditions must be applied  7, 8  leading to artificial interactions between images of the same interface  9  .

We show that this approach leads to results which are consistent with those obtained using Onsager s theory at high temperatures (T_T>T_N), but also provides new insight into the structure of the nematic phase near its critical point.

These features have been studied extensively over many years both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003 , Done et al 2004 .

The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968).

        "original_text": "In this work, we study spin effect on resonant tunneling characteristics in double-barrier heterostructure under longitudinal stresses by using transfer matrix method and density functional theory (DFT). We find that the energy gap decreases with increasing stress for both majority-spin electrons and minority-spin holes. The decrease is more significant for minority-spin holes than for majority-spin electrons. In addition, the transmission coefficient increases with increasing stress at low bias voltage but decreases at high bias voltage. This behavior can be explained as follows. At low bias voltage, the increase of transmission coefficient results mainly from the reduction of barrier height due to compressive stress. However, at high bias voltage, the decrease of transmission coefficient comes from two factors: one is the increase of effective mass induced by tensile stress; another is the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction caused by tensile stress. Finally, it should be noted that our calculation shows that the spin-orbit coupling has little influence on the transport properties of the system considered here.",

        "original_text": "We present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 . Even today there exist many open questions about black holes  4  . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of luminescence phenomena has been attracting considerable attention over many years because it provides valuable information about electronic structure and optical properties of solids  1  . Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly useful since it enables us to probe the distribution function of electrons excited into the conduction band  2  .\nIn recent decades there have been numerous attempts to develop theoretical models describing various aspects of luminescence processes  3  , including thermal stimulation luminescence  4  -  8  . However, most of these works were based on the assumption that the system under consideration is always close to equilibrium  9  . As a result they cannot describe correctly some important features observed experimentally  10  . For example, the shape of the TSL glow curve depends strongly on the type of material  11  : while in insulators it usually exhibits a single peak  12  , in metals it often consists of several peaks  13  . Moreover, even within the same class of materials, e.g., semiconductor crystals  14  , the number of peaks may vary depending on the doping level  15  . These observations cannot be explained using existing theories  16  .",

In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z.

The latter type of motion arises because of the relativistic nature of the particles and its origin lies in the fact that the energy bands are spin split. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the physics behind phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect or the integer quantum Hall effect at high Landau levels. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of interacting fermions under strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been studied extensively over many years  1  . In particular, it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional filling factors  2  , where the number of filled Landau levels differs from the expected value  3  .\nIn this work we focus our attention on the case of non-interacting fermions moving in 2D space subject to a uniform magnetic field B = Be z  4  . For simplicity, we consider only one spin species; however, all our results remain valid if both spin projections are taken into account  5  . In addition, we assume that the Fermi level lies within the conduction band  6  . Under these conditions, the low-energy excitations around the Fermi surface are well-described by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian  7, 8  \nwhere v F denotes the Fermi velocity, σ i=x,y,z denote Pauli matrices acting on the spinor wave function Ψ(r), p x = −i∂/∂x and p y = −i∂/(−i∂y).

In particular, we find that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free space modes increases with increasing number N of electrons involved in the qubit state. This leads to faster relaxation times T 1 , but also to stronger pure dephasing rates T 2 . For realistic values of N = 10 − 100, however, these effects remain small compared to other sources of relaxation such as phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum information processing has attracted considerable attention over recent years due to its potential applications in various fields ranging from communication technology  1  to metrology  2  .
