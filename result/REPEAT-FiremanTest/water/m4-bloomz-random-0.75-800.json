The results show that, for this particular measurement scheme, there is no violation of Bell s inequality or any other form of nonlocality. We also demonstrate how our setup can be used to investigate quantum contextuality by performing two different experiments with identical settings but opposite outcomes. In one case we observe violations of Bell inequalities while in the other they are not violated. This shows that the observed behavior cannot be explained within classical physics and demonstrates quantum contextuality. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical quantities such as position and momentum do not have simultaneous well-defined values. Instead these quantities exist only as probability distributions which evolve continuously over time according to Schrödinger s equation. However, it has been shown that if both position and momentum were measured simultaneously then their respective probabilities would interfere destructively resulting in a zero probability of measuring either quantity at its most probable value  1  . This phenomenon known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to the concept of complementarity: the impossibility of observing all properties of a system simultaneously  2  .\nIn 1964 John Bell showed that local hidden variable theories could not explain some predictions made by quantum mechanics  3  , leading to the formulation of Bell s theorem  4  .

We find that the inclusion of these additional physical processes has important consequences for disc structure and evolution.  In particular, we show that the presence of an initial magnetic field can significantly affect the mass distribution within the disc at early times by suppressing fragmentation near the central star. This leads to more massive discs than those found previously with purely hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting discs are also less flared due to the increased pressure support provided by the magnetic field. As time progresses, however, the magnetic field is dissipated through ohmic dissipation and turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities.

We show that there are two different ways how one can define this quantity depending on whether or not one takes into account the back-reaction effects due to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. The first approach leads to an expression for the semiclassical propagator which coincides with the Feynman propagator at large distances but differs significantly near the source point. In particular it does not satisfy the Hadamard condition required by general relativity. On the other hand, if we take into account the back reaction then the resulting expression satisfies all necessary conditions including the Hadamard condition.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Highly turbulent solutions of LANS-alpha and their LES potential .\nAbstract:\nWe present highly resolved numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the LANS-alpha model, which is known to produce good results for wall-bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades  1, 2  . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems  3–5  , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models  6  .\nIn recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged  7–10  .

The DGC consists of several proteins including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin.   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding for dystrophin lead to loss of this protein from the sarcolemma resulting in severe muscle wasting.  However, it has been shown that expression of utrophin can compensate for the absence of dystrophin by binding to other components of the DGC such as alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG).  This study investigated whether processing of beta-dystroglycan affects its ability to bind with utrophin or its homologous counterpart, dp116, using normal mouse Schwann cells (MSC) and mdx mice lacking functional dystrophin.  Beta-dystroglycan was found to be processed into two different forms in both MSCs and mdx sciatic nerves.  One form had a molecular weight similar to that observed in normal mouse brain tissue while another form showed higher mobility when compared to the first one.  Both forms were able to interact with utrophin but only the lower molecular weight form could also bind to dp116.

The experiments were performed using an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope equipped with a molecular beam source for dosing O 2 molecules onto clean, well-ordered Al(111) surfaces held at different sample temperatures between 10 and 100 K. We find that the sticking probability decreases strongly when increasing the surface temperature due to thermal activation of vibrational modes which lead to non-collinearity of electronic states involved in the reaction process. This effect is also observed during the subsequent desorption of atomic oxygen from the surface. In addition we observe a pronounced dependence of the sticking coefficient on the kinetic energy of incident oxygen molecules: At high energies (>500 meV), where the molecule-surface interaction time becomes comparable or even shorter than typical vibrational periods, the sticking probability increases again as compared to lower kinetic energies.",

We find that MDFs are similar to each other within errors except those at |b| > 30° where there is an excess of metal-poor stars compared to the disk population. The fraction of metal-poor stars increases towards higher latitude. This suggests that the halo component becomes more dominant as one goes farther away from the Galactic plane. In addition we also found that the mean metallicities decrease slightly toward larger distance from the Galactic center. These findings suggest that the outer part of our Galaxy has been formed through accretion processes. \n \n Keywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It is well known that the Milky Way consists of three main components -the thin disk, thick disk and halo. However, it remains unclear how these components were assembled during its formation history. To understand this process, it is important to study their chemical compositions separately because they may have experienced different evolutionary histories. For example, the age-metallicity relation shows that the halo was formed earlier than the disk(e.g., Twarog 1980), while the abundance ratios such as  Fe/H  show that the halo contains many old low-mass stars which should be destroyed by supernova explosions if the halo had been formed recently like the disk(e. g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). \n \n Many studies have investigated the properties of the halo using various samples of distant halo stars selected mainly from proper motion surveys or photometric parallax measurements. Recently, large spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , RAVE survey (Steinmetz 2003 )and SEGUE survey (Yanny et al. 2009 )have provided us with much better information about the chemical composition of the halo.

These mechanisms can arise when large - intensity cosmic beams struck Earth s climate ; therefore , it could also be could that these reactions play some role in the development of heavy components during stellar evolve . For example , researchers have proposed that helium - 4 could create through a number of fusion reactions using helium - 3 and neutrons . However , before we can learn what changes inside stars like our Sun , we need to learn more about the essential interactions involved in these forms of reactions . To help us learn more about them , physicists at MIT used model quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) , a technique similar to those used in long field experiments but conducted on computers rather of accelerators , to predict the behavior of certain atomic reactions . Specifically , they studied the response p + p + n - - > d + d + n , where p stands for proton , n for neutron , d for deuteron , and d + means a positively charged deuteron .

The results show that there are significant differences in the IM plasma pressure profiles obtained with different satellites. In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system. This suggests that the observed difference in the pressure profiles can be attributed mainly to the spatial variation of the pressure rather than temporal changes.",

We find that RT can significantly enhance the strength of the 21 cm signal by up to an order of magnitude compared to calculations neglecting RT effects. The enhancement is caused mainly by Lyman-alpha photons produced inside galaxies which are absorbed outside them due to scattering off neutral hydrogen atoms. This leads to additional heating of the intergalactic medium through photoionization heating and Compton cooling. In addition we show that the inclusion of RT also changes the shape of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that future radio telescopes such as SKA will be able to detect this signal if they have sufficient sensitivity.

The source reached its highest recorded state ever detected at TeV energies during this period. We present results based on data taken simultaneously with Swift-XRT and UVOT instruments that show no significant change in X-ray or optical emission properties over the course of the outburst. This suggests that the high-energy emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons located close to the central black hole rather than synchrotron radiation emitted by particles accelerated up to high Lorentz factors within the jet itself. These findings are consistent with theoretical models where particle acceleration takes place in shocks formed when jets collide with surrounding clouds.

The asymmetric division contains one molecule of alanine in which both carboxylate groups are protonated to give an overall charge of + 1 . In the crystal matrix each amino acid is linked via O - [UNK] hydrogen bonds into chains running similar to 010 . These chains are further connected through N - [UNK] hydrogen bonding interactions between adjacent molecules along the c - axis direction leading to layers perpendicular to ( 001 ) . The water molecules form intermolecular O - [UNK] and O - [UNK] interactions with neighbouring amino acids within these layers . A comparison of strain lengths shows that there is no much changes between the two polymorphic structures reported for this compound . This supports that the differences seen in their physical structures could be due to different packing structures rather than changes in molecular conformation .",

The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate.

We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius.

We show how this scenario could explain several puzzling observations in astrophysics and cosmology. In particular we argue that: (i) The observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are explained by the presence of a halo of cold dark matter surrounding each galaxy.

One particularly interesting class of models involves so-called WIMPZILLAs  1  , i.e., stable relic particles with masses around $10^9$ GeV or higher  2  . These particles would have been produced thermally in the early Universe but their abundance today should still be determined by their annihilation cross section  3  .\nIn this Letter we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of dark matter based on the idea that it consists of self-gravitating bosons  4  . Boson stars  5  are gravitationally bound states of scalar fields  6  predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model  7, 8  . They were first studied in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories  9  where they play the role of solitonic solutions  10  .

We show how this can lead to superluminal communication between two parties sharing entangled particles by using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Finally we generalize the Born rule to allow for arbitrary measurements instead of just von Neumann ones. The usual formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are performed under ideal conditions where no errors occur during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in practice there always exist some experimental imperfections such as decoherence due to environmental noise, imprecision in state preparations, and inaccuracy in measurements.

We find that the observed X-ray light curve can be reproduced by assuming an initial mass loss rate of ~10-6 Msun/yr for the red giant component, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.  The predicted temperature structure of the shocked region agrees well with the observationally inferred one. Our model also predicts that the optical depth to X-rays should increase as time goes on because of the increasing density of the ejecta. This prediction seems to be supported by recent Swift/XRT observations. In addition we show that the observed UV fluxes are not explained by the standard steady state photoionization model but require additional heating source such as shocks or magnetic reconnection.

We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved.

We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions. This suggests that the apparent constancy of loop widths may be due to averaging effects rather than being intrinsic properties of coronal structures. In addition, we show that the widths derived from observations made under different viewing angles do not depend significantly on the position angle of the line-of-sight relative to the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field vector.",

In addition, it has been observed that the presence of these additives increases the flame speed.

The analysis is performed within the framework of collinear factorisation and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al.. We find that the observed suppression of leading neutron production relative to deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects alone without invoking any additional mechanism such as intrinsic charm or gluon saturation.

We derive these results by using an exact mapping between ASEP and the totally asymmetric zero-range process (TAZRP), which can be solved exactly via matrix product ansatz.

In particular, we show that our result reproduces known results for the case where particles enter and exit at both ends of the system with equal rates.

INTRODUCTIO N\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (AS EP)\nis one of the most fundamental models describing nonequilibrium phenomena  1  . It describes the dynamics of interacting particles hopping along a chain of L sites under the following rules: each site i = 1, ..., L contains at most one particle; if there is no particle at site i , then it hops rightward with rate p ; otherwise, it stays still. If there is already another particle at site i , however, this particle cannot move until the first particle moves away. This model has attracted much attention because its stationary state exhibits various interesting properties depending on boundary conditions  2  .\nIn recent years, several studies have focused on the so-called open-boundary condition  3  -  8  : Particles enter into the leftmost site of the chain with probability α per unit time and leave from the rightmost site with probability β per unit time. For example, when α = β = 1/2, the stationary state becomes uniform regardless of the initial configuration  9  . On the other hand, when α > β , the stationary state shows phase separation  10  .

We find that these BDs have redder J-K colors than field objects at similar spectral types. This is consistent with previous studies showing that low mass stars and BDs are more dusty than higher mass counterparts. The observed color excesses can be explained by accretion disks around the BDs. Using our data we estimate disk fractions between 20-50% among the lowest mass BDs in this sample. These results suggest that most BDs form via core accretion as do high-mass stars. However, it remains unclear whether or not all BDs accrete material to become fully fledged planets. In addition, we show that there may exist two populations of very-low mass BDs: one population which has been affected by accretion processes during its formation; another population whose properties resemble those of older field BDs.",

The rate at which this happens depends on how much gas there is available for collapse.   In turn, the amount of gas available for collapse depends on the balance between inflow (from larger scales) and outflow (from smaller scales).   This talk will discuss recent work that has been done using numerical simulations to understand these processes better. It will also present some new results on the role played by magnetic fields during star formation. Star formation takes place when dense gas clouds collapse under their own gravity into bound objects called protostars.  These protostars then grow through accretion until they reach the main sequence stage where nuclear fusion begins.  During this process, gravitational energy is released as radiation and kinetic energy, heating up surrounding material and driving powerful winds and jets.  As such, understanding what controls the rate at which stars are formed requires an understanding of how gas flows onto forming stars.  Gas can flow towards forming stars either directly or indirectly via filaments.  Directly flowing gas may be channeled along magnetic field lines while indirectly flowing gas may be transported along with turbulent motions.  Both types of flows have been observed around young stars but it remains unclear whether one type dominates over another.  Recent observations suggest that both direct and indirect flows play important roles depending on the environment.  For example, observations show that most low-mass stars accrete...",

We find that, during current-induced mass transport along steps, the step edges fluctuate strongly with time. These fluctuations are characterized by an exponential growth followed by saturation after about 1 hour. In addition to this general behavior we observe different types of fluctuations depending on the applied voltage and temperature. For low voltages and temperatures below 300 K, the fluctuations show a sawtooth-like shape indicating periodic changes between two states. At higher voltages or temperatures above 400 K, the fluctuations become more irregular but still exhibit some periodicity.

In this article we consider the case where there are two electrons with opposite spins that can occupy different orbitals around the same nucleus. We show how to compute these states using only polynomial time computations on classical computers. This result was obtained by applying some techniques developed recently in computational complexity theory such as the PCP theorem (the probabilistic checkable proof) and the local testability of CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems). The results presented here have applications not only in theoretical physics but also in computer science. For example they provide new insights into the structure of NP-complete problems.

We find that the observed number density of lenses is consistent with predictions based on cold dark matter simulations but inconsistent at more than 3 sigma confidence level if we assume a standard thermal relic WDM model with mass mX = 1 keV. This result suggests either that the current WDM scenario needs to be modified or that there are other systematic effects which have not been taken into account in our analysis. The full text can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604070v1.pdf . \nThe existence of dark matter has now been established beyond reasonable doubt through its gravitational influence on visible matter. However, despite decades of research, little else about this mysterious substance is known. In particular, it remains unclear whether dark matter consists of one particle species only - as assumed in most theoretical studies -or whether it comprises several different particles.

In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial topology.   The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.

We also discuss some recent advances in this area that have been made by our group at Columbia University. The main focus is on the development of new algorithms for computing accurate estimates of the power spectrum of signals defined over the surface of the unit sphere using only partial information about these signals. In particular, we consider two classes of methods: those based on the use of spherical harmonic expansions and those based on wavelet transforms. Finally, we briefly describe several open research questions related to the topic discussed here. Spherical data arise naturally in many areas of science including astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, geodesy, and medicine.

In this work, we perform large-scale quantum transport simulations on GNR-FETs by solving the nonequilibrium Green s function equations within an effective mass approximation.

The ON/OFF current ratio also shows similar trends but its value becomes saturated around 100 nm.

We show that, for an interferometer with SRM, there is no fundamental limit on its sensitivity at high frequencies due to vacuum fluctuations. The shot-noise limited sensitivity can be improved by increasing the circulating power inside the cavity formed between the two arms of the detector. This improvement comes at the expense of increased thermal noise associated with the mirrors forming this cavity. In addition we find that the effect of radiation pressure noise depends strongly on whether or not the input test mass is suspended. Finally, we discuss how these results may be used to improve existing designs of advanced LIGO-like detectors.

Title:  Quantum Noise in Differential-type Gravitational-wave Interferometer and Signal Recycling . Abstract : We research the quantum noise features of gravitational wave detectors with signal recycling technique ( SRM ) . We show that , for an interferometer with SRM , there is no essential limit on its sensitivity at large signals due to noise fluctuations . The shot - noise reduced sensitivity can be augmented by increasing the circulating force inside the chamber formed between the two arms of the detector . This improvement runs at the expense of increased thermal noise common with the mirrors creating this cavity . In addition we prove that the result of emission force noise depends strongly on whether or not the input sample weight is suspended .

The objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual quality-of-service constraints at each user s receiver. In order to obtain tractable results, we make use of tools from stochastic geometry which allow us to model the locations of both mobiles and interferers as point processes.

In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Strömgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field. By performing numerical simulations for different values of the spin temperature T S , we find that the 21-cm PS has a characteristic peak structure which reflects the shapes of individual H II regions. This peak structure becomes more prominent as T S decreases because the number of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the decrease in the brightness temperature difference between the CMB and the 21-cm emission line. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use this peak structure to constrain the value of T S .

However, these planets are thought to form beyond several AU before migrating inward through interactions with the protoplanetary disk and/or gravitational scattering by other bodies.

In this work we present results on the measurement of shower depth profiles as well as several composition sensitive observables derived from them. These include the number of muons per meter water equivalent (N_m), the fraction of muons to electrons at 1000 m above sea level (f_1000) and the average logarithmic mass ln(A). We compare these results for different zenith angles and energies. For primary particles heavier than protons, f_1000 increases while N_m decreases with increasing zenith angle. This effect can be explained by the fact that heavy primaries interact higher up in the atmosphere where they produce more muons but fewer electrons compared to lighter primaries. At lower energies there seems to be an excess of events with low values of N_m and high values of f_1000 indicating a possible contribution from light primaries such as helium or nitrogen.",

Here we propose that graphene can be used as such material by exploiting its unique electronic structure. We show how this leads to a novel type of spin transistor which operates at room temperature without external magnetic fields or applied gate voltages. The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic contacts connected via a single layer of graphene. By applying a voltage between these contacts one can control the SOC strength in the graphene channel leading to a change in the transmission probability through it. This results in a switching behavior similar to conventional transistors. In addition, our analysis shows that the proposed device exhibits high on/off ratios even when operating under realistic conditions. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of the proposed device. Graphene is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics because of its unique electronic properties  1  .

We use these data to derive an improved estimate of the mean value of the surface thermal inertia, I = 100 ± 50 J m-2 s-1/2 K-1, which is in good agreement with previous estimates obtained by other authors using different methods. The derived values are also consistent with laboratory experiments performed at high temperatures that show how the thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. Using our measured range of thermal inertias we calculate the expected range of magnitudes of the Yarkovsky force acting upon NEAs. Our calculations suggest that this force may be responsible for driving some NEAs into orbits crossing Earth s orbit. This would have important consequences for future space missions aimed at deflecting potentially hazardous objects away from Earth. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) represent a significant threat to human civilization because they can impact the Earth within one million years. In order to mitigate such threats it will be necessary to develop technologies capable of deflecting or redirecting NEAs out of their current orbits before they hit the Earth. One possible method involves applying a small impulse to the asteroid s trajectory through the action of the Yarkovsky-O Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends critically on the ability to predict accurately the strength of the YORP effect.",

This suggests that different physical processes may be responsible for these two tracks. In addition, we also found evidence for a hysteresis effect in both tracks.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

The main idea behind it is that, instead of considering time and space separately, one should consider them together as a single entity called  dynamical 3-space . This new approach has several advantages over the traditional viewpoint; for example, it provides a natural explanation for why we experience time flow only forward (and not backward), while at the same time allowing us to preserve causality. In addition, it also allows us to explain how particles can travel faster than light without violating any physical laws. Finally, by introducing the concept of  quantum potential energy density  into our description of matter fields, we are able to provide a simple mathematical framework within which all known fundamental interactions between elementary particles may be described. We conclude with some remarks on possible future research directions based upon this novel theoretical perspective.",

We show that selection against demographic stochasticity leads to increased reproductive effort early in life (i.e., earlier reproduction) and decreased mortality rates later in life. This is because higher reproductive efforts increase offspring numbers but also lead to more deaths due to competition for resources among siblings. In contrast, lower mortality rates decrease sibling competition and thus reduce the number of deaths caused by this source of demographic stochasticity. Our results are robust across different levels of environmental stochasticity and initial conditions. The evolutionary consequences of demographic stochasticity have been studied extensively in recent years  1–3  . However, most studies on this topic focus on populations without age structure or assume that all individuals reproduce at the same age  4–6  , which may not be realistic  7–9  .\nHere we use an age-structured model with stochastic demographic events  10, 11  to investigate how selection acts on life-history traits when there is variation in individual ages at first reproduction  12  .

For example, if we consider two different distributions of mutational distances (the exponential and power law), then the same genotype will dominate both cases.

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers  1  . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity  2  .

The main goal of the experiment is to search for the appearance of electron-neutrinos in a muon-neutrino beam produced at CERN s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), as illustrated in Figure 1 .\nIn order to achieve the required statistical accuracy within reasonable running time, the experiment will run in two phases. Phase I started in 2011 and ran until 2014; during that phase only one out of four possible detectors was operational. Phase II has just begun and runs until 2019 or 2020 when all detectors should be fully operational. During both phases data taking takes place simultaneously with the far detector (FD) situated 12 m underground at a distance of 1 km from the ND280 target  3  . \nNeutrino Flux Prediction\nThe prediction of the neutrino flux Φ(Eν ) reaching the ND280 detector depends on many parameters such as: the number N p of protons hitting the production target per second, their kinetic energy T p , the fraction f π 0 of neutral pions decaying into photons, the pion momentum distribution dN/dpπ etc.. These quantities can be measured directly using dedicated calibration experiments  4  . For example, the proton current Ip = Np /T p is determined by counting the number of protons hitting the target over a given period of time",

We observe that the intensity and linewidth of the low-energy spin waves decrease with increasing temperature up to T* ~ 150 K, which is higher than Tc by about 50 K. The observed behavior can be explained within the framework of the spin-fermion model if one assumes that the spin-wave lifetime decreases rapidly at temperatures close to T* due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles. This interpretation implies that the pseudogap opens already below T* as suggested previously. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high-temperature superconductors using neutron scattering techniques  1-5 . Neutron scattering allows us not only to investigate the static structure factor S(Q) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons  6 . It was found recently  7-9  that the low energy spin wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 displays unusual features compared to conventional metals. For example, it exhibits a strong dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions  8  and shows significant deviations from the usual linear dependence between the inverse spin wave velocity and momentum  9 . These results have stimulated theoretical studies  10-12  aimed at understanding how these unconventional spin wave properties are related to the electronic structure of the CuO2 planes. However, little attention has so far been paid to the effect of doping on the spin wave dynamics. Here we present new experimental data obtained on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX (x= 6.35), where x denotes the oxygen content  13 .

Title : Evidence for decay of spin - beams above the pseudogap in underdoped YBa2Cu3O6 . 35 . Abstract : We report on decay scattering experiments conducted to research magnetic excitations in an underdoped cuprate superconductor , YBa2Cu3Ox ( x = 6 . 35 ) . We notice that the intensity and linewidth of the lowest - value charge beams decline with increasing heating up to T * ~ 150 K , which is higher than Tc by about 50 K . The seen behavior can be described within the context of the magnetic - fermion model if one assumes that the charge - wave life decline rapidly at depths close to T * due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles . This construction assumes that the pseudogap starts also below T * as indicated previously . Introduction In subsequent years there has been considerable interest in studying the features of large - rate superconductors using decay scattering techniques 1 - 5 . Neutron background allows us not only to investigate the periodic structure factor S ( Q ) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons 6 . It was found recently 7 - 9 that the reduced intensity magnetic wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 exhibits extraordinary features versus to standard metals . For example , it exhibits a fine dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions 8 and shows considerable deviations from the normal linear dependence between the dual quantum wave speed and value 9 . These results have stimulated theoretical research 10 - 12 directed at understanding how these alternative spin wave structures are connected to the electronic behavior of the CuO2 molecules . However , little interest has so yet been made to the influence of doping on the spin wave dynamics . Here we show latest experimental data collected on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX ( x = 6 . 35 ) , where x denotes the oxygen content 13 . Our main goal is to explore whether the spin wave values alter significantly when went away from optimal doping towards reduced values of x .",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Shock-triggered formation of magnetically-dominated clouds .\nAbstract:\nWe present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) . It has been suggested that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during different stages of evolution of molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). \n \n Recent observational studies have shown that many young massive stars are associated with filamentary structures observed in infrared dust emission maps (André et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2013 ). These filaments often appear to be aligned along magnetic field directions inferred from polarisation measurements (Chapman et al. 2011) , suggesting that magnetic fields might play an important role in regulating the dynamics of such systems. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields can affect the stability properties of self-gravitating clouds against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomis",

Abstract : We give the results of three - detailed MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds , and lead to the formed of large filaments with large weight - to - magnetic ratios . The preliminary results are made on observations of adjacent star - creating regions . We say that shock compression results to an increase in density and heating at the post - shock region . This causes the gas force slope across the shock front to decline rapidly as life continues . As a result , the field rows become more twisted due to flow dynamics caused by the shock wave . In addition , we conclude that the magnetic information is shifted into kinetic information through Alfvén fields generated behind the shock fields . Finally , we prove that these mechanisms create the magnetic magnetic - to - mass factor to increase significantly within the disturbed region .

In this study we have investigated these properties using alkanol monolayers on an aqueous subphase as model systems to mimic the hydrocarbon chains present in crude oils. The results show that the vapor pressures of the alkanols increase with chain length up to C8 but decrease again above C10. This is explained by considering the competition between two opposing effects:  On one hand, increasing chain lengths lead to higher molecular volumes which favor evaporation. On the other hand, longer chains also result in stronger van der Waals interactions within the liquid phase leading to lower vapor pressures. We find that the solubilities of the alkanols follow similar trends as those observed for the vapor pressures. However, the differences in solubility among different chain lengths become smaller when compared to the corresponding differences in vapor pressure.

This system has log NHI / cm−2 = 19 . 6 + 0 . 2 −0 . 1 , equivalent to a total hydrogen molecular density of 5 x 1020 cm−2 . It also shows good lowest - ionization interactions such as Al iii λ1854 , 1854 + 1862 , and S iv λ1063 , 1073 that are not seen in traditional long - redshift absorbers . These features suggest that this absorber could be similar to those found along quasar sightlines .",

Here we show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) can be delivered directly to synaptic sites by lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane or indirectly via endocytosis followed by recycling endosomes. We used single-particle tracking with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to follow GluR2-containing AMPA receptors tagged with quantum dots at hippocampal neuron dendrites. The results reveal two distinct trafficking routes for receptor delivery to synapses. First, receptors diffuse laterally along the surface until encountering an existing synapse where they become trapped. Second, receptors enter endosomal vesicles after endocytosis and then recycle back to the cell surface through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes before being targeted to new synapses. These findings provide insights into mechanisms underlying formation of functional neuronal circuits during development as well as plasticity of mature neurons.",

The cascade process is modeled by using a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are derived based on dimensional analysis and Kolmogorov s similarity hypothesis. We show that the presence of particles can significantly affect both the energy transfer rate between different scales as well as the dissipation rates at small scales.

The new metric has several advantages over previous proposals, including manifestly positive kinetic terms and no need for additional counterterms at higher orders. We show how this metric can be used to compute beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory using only Feynman diagrams with one-loop vacuum bubbles as building blocks. This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties. In addition we find evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the beta function of the string coupling constant.

We show that these theories are not free at high energies but instead have an interacting fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. This is achieved by using the recently developed technique of holographic renormalization to compute the beta functions of the gauge coupling constants as well as those associated with higher-derivative terms in the action. The latter can be used to stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. In particular we find that there exists a large class of models which admit metastable de Sitter solutions. These results provide further evidence for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS 7 vacuua in this context.

We show how these processes affect the evolution of grain size distributions as well as their spatial distribution within the disk. In particular we find that: (i) The maximum grain sizes are limited to values between 1 mm and 10 cm depending on the strength of the stellar UV field. (ii) Grains grow faster at larger distances from the star due to lower gas densities and higher temperatures. (iii) Fragmentation is more efficient closer to the star where the local pressure maxima lead to enhanced collisional velocities.

Abstract : We give an analytical model for the growth , spiral drift and fragmentation of powder grains in protoplanetary belts that evolve under the combined influence of viscous accretion onto the surrounding planet and photoevaporation by external emission fields . We show how these mechanisms influence the behavior of food large ranges as also as their spatial distribution within the disk . In specifically we say that : ( i ) The maximum grain sizes are restricted to values between 1 mm and 10 cm depending on the intensity of the stellar UV field . ( II ) Grains expand larger at larger ranges from the star due to smaller gas densities and higher temperatures . ( iii ) Fragmentation is more effective closer to the star where the regional force maxima lead to higher collisional velocities . These results have key implications for planet formed scenarios since they suggest that planetesimals can exist only close to the star while large structures such as asteroids or comets could be could to develop farther out in the disk .",

We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum information processing requires the manipulation of quantum states over large distances.

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",

The system consists of particles interacting via a hard-core repulsion and a short-range attraction that decays exponentially fast at large distances. We show how to calculate exactly the density profile near the wall as well as the surface tension between the liquid phase and the gas phase. In particular, we find that there is no true equilibrium state corresponding to complete wetting by the liquid phase; instead, the interface becomes rough when the temperature decreases below some critical value T*.

The lack of any spectral evolution across this break suggests it was caused by energy injection into the blast wave. We find no evidence for dust extinction along our line-of-sight; however we cannot rule out significant reddening due to host galaxy dust.

This effort has led to several successful models describing the prompt phase of GRB emission (see e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but less progress on explaining the origin of the afterglow component. A key feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or  jet break  in the light curve around one day postburst (Rhoads 1999) . Such breaks have traditionally been interpreted as marking the time when the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, causing the flux density to drop rapidly. However, some authors argue that such breaks can also arise if the ejecta undergoes continued energy input following the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000) , while others suggest that they could instead result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008 ).

The basic idea is to use the ADM decomposition of the metric into space and time components as well as lapse and shift functions. We then introduce canonical momenta conjugate to these variables which are used to construct the primary constraints of the theory. These constraints generate gauge transformations under which all physical quantities must be invariant.

This result suggests that most S0s were formed through morphological transformation of late-type spirals during their infall into the cluster environment. In addition to this morphological transformation scenario, we also consider other possible mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas and tidal interactions between galaxies.

We also show how to find all possible circuits if they exist. Our results are based on recent work showing that any time-independent Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of commuting projectors onto its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to reduce the problem of finding a realization of a general time-independent Hamiltonian into several instances of the same problem but restricted to smaller Hilbert spaces.

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al.

We learn that galaxies are preferentially arranged opposite to their local tidal field on sizes larger than 1 Mpc / h . This alignment is stronger for more large galaxies at higher redshifts . The seen spiral - tide correlation can be described by the influence of gravitational torques exerted by large - complex structures during the formed cycle of these galaxies .

These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular orbit as also as for interpreting observations of cosmic stress statistics . Introduction : Galaxies create within overdense regions of the world where they experience heavy gravitational interactions with other structures such as adjacent galaxies or groups of galaxies .

We find that for sufficiently large values of the longitudinal magnetic field, the damping is dominated by resonant absorption and it increases with increasing longitudinal magnetic field strength. For smaller values of the longitudinal magnetic fields we find that the damping is due to phase mixing between Alfvén waves propagating along neighboring flux tubes. In this case the damping decreases as the longitudinal magnetic field becomes weaker. The results are compared with observations made at the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) instrument aboard SOHO spacecraft.

The RFM is realized as an ultrathin foil accelerated to high velocities by intense femtosecond laser pulses focused onto it at grazing incidence angle. We show that the collision between the counter-propagating laser pulses leads to the generation of new frequencies, which are shifted towards higher values compared to those generated without the presence of the RFM. This effect can be explained within the framework of nonlinear optics and quantum electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the possibility for generating high-energy photons via collisions of laser pulses in vacuum. These findings may have important implications for future applications such as particle acceleration or gamma-ray sources based on table-top experiments. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in studying the interaction of ultra-intense lasers with matter under extreme conditions  1  .

Title:  Relativistic Tennis with Photons: Demonstration of Frequency Upshifting by a Relativistic Flying Mirror through Two Colliding Laser Pulses . Abstract : We note on the experimental performance of rate upshift in two colliding laser signals using a relativistically flying reflection ( RFM ) . The RFM is realized as an ultrathin foil excited to large velocities by intense femtosecond wave signals centered onto it at grazing incidence edge . We show that the contact between the counter - propagating wavelength signals gives to the generation of different signals , which are shifted towards higher values compared to those generated without the presence of the RFM . This result can be described within the context of nonlinear optics and quantum electrodynamics . Our results show the possibility for generating large - intensity photons via collisions of laser signals in vacuum . These findings could have key implications for later experiments such as electron acceleration or gamma - field systems using on table - top experiments . In subsequent years there has been growing interest in studying the interaction of ultra - bright lasers with matter under severe circumstances 1 .

The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time  1  . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski  2  who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

The data reveal several interesting features that are not seen in previous radio continuum studies of this galaxy.

We use a sample of early-type galaxies selected by their colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6), which contains about 1 million objects with spectroscopic redshifts between 0 < z < 0.3.

For our analysis we used only those galaxies that have no nearby companions brighter than them by more than one magnitude to avoid any possible contamination due to tidal interactions or mergers. \n \n In order to investigate how these structural properties depend on environment and nuclear activity, we divided our sample into four different subsamples based on the values of local density and AGN luminosity: low-density/low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), high-density/high-luminosity active Galactic Nuclei (HLAGNs), low-density/high-luminous inactive galaxies (LHIGGs), and high-density/low-luminous inactive galaxies(HLIGGs). \n \n Our results show that LLAGNs are generally rounder and less concentrated compared to HLAGNs.

In order to investigate how these structural structures depend on background and nuclear activity , we divided our sample into four different subsamples according on the values of regional density and AGN luminosity : small - density / short - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( LLAGNs ) , long - density / long - luminosity independent Galactic Nuclei ( HLAGNs ) , High - density / large - luminous passive galaxies ( LHIGGs ) , and high - density / little - luminous passive galaxies ( HLIGGs ) . Our results show that LLAGNs are generally rounder and less large compared to HLAGNs . This suggests that LLAGNs could be becoming morphological transformations caused by ecological impacts and / or internal mechanisms involved with black hole growth . On average , LHIGGs seem to be rounder but slightly less distributed than HLIGGs . However , there shows to be an overlap among all four parameters for most of the structural parameters considered here .",

In particular we consider two different types of boundary conditions at one end of the chain (the origin) which lead to completely different behaviour of the system as time evolves. The first type is known as Dirichlet boundary condition, corresponding to reflecting particles back into the origin after they have left it once; while the second case corresponds to absorbing particles when they reach the origin. For both these cases we calculate exactly the evolution operator over all times t > 0 using our new method. Finally, by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the evolution operator we can recover the full probability distribution function of finding the walker at any position x along the chain at time t.",

We find that there is a crossover between two different regimes as we increase the strength of disorder. In one regime (weak disorder), the system shows Anderson localization behavior; while in another regime (strong disorder) it exhibits Bose glass behavior. The transition point depends strongly on the filling fraction of particles per site. For low fillings, this transition occurs at relatively small values of disorder strengths. However, for higher fillings, the transition to the Bose glass phase takes place only when the disorder becomes very strong. This suggests that the presence of interactions can significantly affect the nature of the ground state of the system even if they are weak compared to other energy scales such as the bandwidth or the disorder strength. \n \n Introduction \n \n Disorder plays an important role in determining many properties of condensed matter systems. It has been shown recently that disorder can lead to interesting phenomena like quantum Hall effect  1  , metal-insulator transitions  2  , and superconductivity  3  . One of the most studied models which incorporates both disorder and interaction effects is the so-called Anderson model  4  . In its simplest form, this model describes non-interacting electrons moving through a disordered medium.

This interpretation is supported by our detection of excess emission in the K-band spectrum during periods when the photometric flux decreases. Our results suggest that the circumstellar disks around each member of the binary have been truncated by their mutual gravitational interaction.

Our results show that mergers can significantly affect these relationships by increasing scatter at fixed luminosity or stellar velocity dispersion. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates. In addition, we find that mergers tend to increase the average BH-to-galaxy mass ratio as well as the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among massive galaxies. These findings are consistent with observations of AGN host galaxies.

This suggests that AGNs are not preferentially found in either red or blue galaxies, as previously thought; instead they appear to be more common among galaxies with intermediate color. The lack of correlation between galaxy color and AGN activity may indicate that AGNs play only a minor role in quenching star formation in massive galaxies.

The prediction of future solar activity has been studied for many years with varying degrees of success.  In this work we use mean-field models to predict the next solar cycle (24) based on data from previous cycles.

Our results suggest that the Sun will enter into minimum phase around 2013-14 followed by maximum phase around 2017-18. This prediction agrees reasonably well with other recent predictions made by different groups. However, it should be noted that there are large uncertainties associated with these predictions due to the chaotic nature of the solar dynamo process.

We find that this burst is consistent with being produced in an off-axis jet viewed at an angle θ ~ 60° to its axis. The observed light curve can be explained as emission from two components: (1) A bright component which peaks early during the prompt phase; it has a duration T90 = 1 s and a fluence Fγ = 2×10−6 erg cm−2. (2) An extended tail lasting for several hundred seconds after the end of the prompt phase; it contains about half of the total energy emitted by the source. Using detailed modeling we show that both these features are naturally reproduced if the burst was generated within a dense stellar wind environment surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star.

This suggests that the gravitational torques induced by the bar can trigger the collapse of dense clouds into new generations of young stars.  - The infrared emission associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shows a clear correlation between the location of this component and the regions of active star formation. - The comparison of our data with hydrodynamical simulations indicates that the observed structure of the ISM may be explained if the bar potential has been able to drive significant amounts of cold gas towards its inner Lindblad resonance.",

We show how FSR can be used in conjunction with the monotone Lasso penalty to produce sparse solutions whose support contains all relevant predictors while simultaneously ensuring their signs are correct.  The resulting algorithm has computational complexity similar to standard Lasso algorithms but produces more accurate results on simulated data sets as well as real-world examples involving gene expression microarray data. Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR), introduced by Frank & Friedman  1  , is an iterative procedure where each iteration consists of adding a single variable into the current set of selected features based on its contribution to the objective function. This process continues until some stopping criteria is reached such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or meeting a desired level of accuracy  2  . In this work we focus on using FSR within the context of linear models with non-negative coefficients. For example, if our goal was to find genes associated with breast cancer then it would make sense to only select those genes that have been shown to increase risk rather than decrease risk  3  .\nThe main advantage of FSR over other greedy selection methods like stepwise regression  4  is that it does not require any tuning parameters  5  .

Abstract : We consider forward stagewise regression ( FSR ) for continuous models with nonnegative coefficients , which is an iterative method that adds parameters to the model one at a later until some stopping factor is met . We show how FSR can be used in combined with the monotone Lasso penalty to produce sparse solutions whose backing contains all relevant predictors while continuously maintaining their predictions are correct . The generated method has computational complexity similar to standard Lasso method but produces more accurate results on simulated data sets as good as actual - world models concerning cell expression microarray data . Forward Stagewise Regression ( FSR ) , introduced by Frank & Friedman 1 , is an iterative method where each iteration means of added a single variable into the current class of selected features depending on its component to the aim value . This method continues until some stopping criteria is reached such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or reaching a desired level of level 2 . In this research we emphasis on using FSR within the context of continuous models with non - negative coefficients .

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe understanding of how macroscopic objects behave under the influence of their environments has been a central issue in physics since its very beginning  1, 2  . This problem becomes particularly challenging when dealing with complex many-body systems such as condensed matter or biological ones  3, 4  , where the number of degrees of freedom involved can be extremely large. A powerful theoretical tool to tackle these problems consists in studying the dynamics of the reduced state of the system of interest S conditioned upon some specific measurement performed over the environmental degrees of freedom E  5, 6  .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop efficient methods to describe the time-evolution of the reduced state  7, 8  . Among them, the so-called Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM)  9  represents a promising alternative to other approaches  10, 11  due to its ability to capture non-Markovian effects  12  . However, despite being able to provide accurate predictions for short-time evolutions  13  , the HDM fails to reproduce correctly the asymptotic behavior of the system  14  . To overcome this limitation, here we introduce a new formulation of the HDM, called Hierarchy of Density...",

As an example , we employ our formalism to consider the dissipative spin - boson model with Ohmic dissipation . Our results are contrasted against numerical simulations using on the Quantum Monte Carlo Wavefunction method . I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK The understanding of how macroscopic things react under the influence of their environments has been a main matter in physics since its very starting 1 , 2 . This problem becomes especially problematic when dealing with complex much - matter systems such as condensed matter or biological matter 3 , 4 , where the number of states of freedom involved can be extremely large . A good theoretical method to overcome these problems relies in studying the dynamics of the reduced level of the system of interest S dependent upon some specific measurement conducted over the environmental periods of freedom E 5 , 6 . In subsequent years there have been numerous efforts to develop effective techniques to explain the time - progression of the reduced number 7 , 8 . Among them , the so - called Hierarchy of Density Matrices ( HDM ) 9 offers a promising alternative to other approaches 10 , 11 due to its ability to trap anti - Markovian interactions 12 . However , despite being sufficient to give accurate predictions for short - past evolutions 13 , the HDM cannot to predict correctly the asymptotic behavior of the system 14 . To overcome this restriction , here we implement a different formulation of the HDM , called Hierarchy of Density . . .",

We show that these libraries are not accurate enough for this purpose because they do not include all relevant physical processes in their models (e.g., convection). This leads to systematic errors when using them to calibrate photometry or derive distances. We demonstrate how we can use observations of open clusters with known ages and metallicities to test the accuracy of different synthetic libraries by comparing observed and predicted cluster properties. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on current synthetic libraries. The next generation of space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented amounts of data about our Galaxy. These new datasets require large efforts to be analyzed properly. One important aspect is the calibration of photometric surveys like Gaia and LSST which will deliver precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky.

These features have been studied extensively over many years both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003 , Done et al 2004 . In particular, they show strong red-shifts indicating that the emitting gas orbits rapidly around the black hole. This rapid rotation causes additional shifts in energy due to relativistic Doppler boosts and gravitational lensing. Relativistic effects become more important if the emitting region has a high degree of rotational support or is viewed nearly face-on. It is therefore necessary to take these effects into account when interpreting observations of such systems. \n\nIn this work we consider the case where the illuminating source is located above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Such sources include magnetic flares produced within the disk itself or active regions associated with the inner edge of the disk.

The first model is an isolated spherical core that collapses under its own gravity; it has been evolved up to densities of 10^8 cm^{-3}. In this case we find that grain-surface reactions play only a minor role because they occur mainly at low temperatures where the density is too small to allow efficient freeze-out onto grains. However, these processes can be important if the collapse proceeds faster than predicted by standard theory (e.g., due to magnetic fields).

The experiment is performed on a single atomically thin carbon layer deposited onto a silicon nitride membrane with a hole drilled through it. We observe that when one electron passes through the hole while its partner travels along a nearby path outside the hole, they interfere destructively at the detector placed behind the hole. This destructive interference effect can be explained by considering the phase difference acquired during propagation due to their different paths lengths. Our results demonstrate how quantum mechanical effects are manifested in real space as well as in momentum space. \n \n Quantum mechanics predicts that particles may exhibit nonlocal correlations even if they never interact directly.

We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually. As a result, other approaches must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars spanning different stages of evolution.\nGyrochronology provides another avenue for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity cycles driven by dynamo processes operating at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003) .

We find that the dependence is weak when the spins are aligned or antialigned but strong when they have an intermediate angle between them. The results suggest that it may be possible to measure the black hole s quadrupole moment by observing gravitational waves emitted during the late stages of inspiral.

The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ). For example, the presence of a massive accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter constant even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr 1963). \n \n Previous studies have shown that the orbital evolution of binaries with non-spinning components is affected by the black-hole quadrupole moment Q = M(1 − S2)/c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999) . However, these effects become negligible once the black holes reach their final plunge phase due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such evolutionary processes, the black holes could acquire large amounts of angular momentum via tidal interactions and/or",

Abstract : We research how the evolve of the Carter number depends on the spin and weight balance in binary systems with spins black holes , using numerical relativity simulations .

The results suggest that it could be could to estimate the visual hole s quadrupole number by observing gravitational signals generated during the late phases of inspiral . This would create information about the spacetime dynamics near the fringe which cannot be achieved otherwise . Introduction In this research we investigate how the evolve of the so - called Carter number depends on the black - hole spin and weight - factor in binary systems including two spins black holes . The Carter number is one of numerous constants of movement connected with geodesic orbits around Kerr black spaces ( Carter 1968 ) . It can be used as a reference of the spacetime dynamics close to the earthquake bin because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists considerable deviation from symmetric stability at small radii ( Bardeen 1973 ; Thorne et l . 1986 ). For example , the presence of a large accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter number even though the total angular value of the system continues unchanged ( Kerr 1963 ) . Previous research have shown that the kinetic behavior of binaries with un - spins components is affected by the hot - hole quadrupole value Q = M ( 1 − S2 ) / c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin factor of each black hole ( Damour & Nagar 1999 ) . However , these impacts become negligible once the black spaces achieve their final plunge stage due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational emission . On the other hand , latest observations suggest that numerous galactic assemblies include supermassive black spaces whose values limit up to 10 ^ 9 solar values ( example . g . , Gebhardt et l . (2000)). These components are expected to evolve through different phases of weight transition before reaching their final state of coalescence .

We find that these correlation functions can be well described by an exponential decay with a characteristic length scale which increases as we lower the temperature towards the glass transition point. This increase is consistent with theoretical predictions based on mode-coupling theory (MCT), but our results show deviations from MCT near the glass transition temperature Tg. These deviations are likely due to dynamic heterogeneities present close to Tg. The data presented here provide new insights into the nature of spatio-temporal fluctuations in glassy systems.

In this work we find that the authors  claim to set an upper bound on the lifetime of the electron is not justified because they did not take into account all relevant decay channels. \n \n We would like to comment briefly on their treatment of backgrounds as well as their choice of cuts used to select events. The main source of background comes from radiative Bhabha scattering e+e-→e+e-γ which has been studied extensively at LEP2  2  , where it was found to be negligible compared to other sources such as two-photon processes or four-fermion final states (e.g., W pair production). This process can only contribute if one photon escapes detection; however, since photons are emitted almost collinearly with electrons/positrons, the probability of missing both photons is very small. Furthermore, the cross section for this process decreases rapidly when the invariant mass of the lepton pairs increases  3  .\n \nThe authors also use a cut on the total energy of the event, Evis>10 GeV, which removes most of these events. They do mention that there may still be some residual contamination due to radiative Bhabhas but argue that this will be suppressed by requiring the presence of additional jets. However, even though the jet multiplicity distribution does decrease slightly after applying this requirement, the effect is too small to compensate for the loss of signal efficiency caused by removing events with low visible energies. \n \nIn addition, the authors state that the contribution from radiative Bhabhas should be included in the systematic uncertainty estimate.

Since then , numerous authors have analyzed numerous topics of cyclic structures and their extensions . For example , consider Fri1 , Fri2 , Koc , Lau , Maz , Nee , Sta . In this section , we will examine cyclic structures in more detail using techniques used recently in the concept of operads and monads . Our main result shows that any cyclic algebra gives rise to two different forms of cyclic homologies , namely the cyclic homology of the basis algebra and the periodic cyclic homology of the adjacent higher algebra . Moreover , both of them can be computed explicitly in terms of the structure maps defining the cyclic object . As a consequence , we obtain explicit formulas for the cyclic homology of all small - level cocommutative Hopf algebras over a field of type 0 .",

The present work was motivated by the recent study on the gauge/gravity correspondence between N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories with 16 supercharges and type IIB strings on AdS5xS5G5 backgrounds  1  . In this context, the existence of nontrivial fixed points would correspond to the conformal invariance of the dual SYM theories  2  , while the imaginary part of the dilatonic scalar fields would indicate the instability of the corresponding solutions  3  .\nIn Ref.  4  , the authors have calculated the one-loop beta functions for both the metric tensor and the dilaton field using the Green-Schwarz formalism  5  . They found that these beta functions do not vanish even if they are evaluated at vanishing values of the string coupling constants. However, their calculations were performed under the assumption that all the fermionic contributions vanish identically  6  . It turns out that such an assumption does not hold true  7, 8  . Therefore, it seems necessary to perform more detailed analysis taking into account the effects due to the fermions as well as those coming from the bosons.",

Abstract : We show the results of subjective assessment experiments conducted on forms intended for using within immersive environments , such as virtual perception ( VR ) and augmented experience ( AR ) . The goal is to investigate how users perceive different type combinations when immersed in these environments . We compare three models : traditional 2D forms , 3D forms that are displayed using perspective projection , and 3D forms that are treated with orthographic translation . Our findings show that there were no considerable differences between the two forms of 3D forms . However , both 3D forms garnered significantly higher rated than their 2D counterparts . This shows that 3D forms can be used successfully in immersive environments without necessary special printing techniques or extra technology . In addition , we found that participants favoured forms that had more visual cues indicating depth information over those that did not have any such cues . Finally , our research also shows that it could be effective to create effective forms by merging forms from different actual forms .",

We find that the energy gap decreases with increasing stress for both majority-spin electrons and minority-spin holes. The decrease is more significant for minority-spin holes than for majority-spin electrons. In addition, the transmission coefficient increases with increasing stress at low bias voltage but decreases at high bias voltage. This behavior can be explained as follows. At low bias voltage, the increase of transmission coefficient results mainly from the reduction of barrier height due to compressive stress. However, at high bias voltage, the decrease of transmission coefficient comes from two factors: one is the increase of effective mass induced by tensile stress; another is the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction caused by tensile stress. Finally, it should be noted that our calculation shows that the spin-orbit coupling has little influence on the transport properties of the system considered here.",

The critical value of the interaction at which this occurs is found to be strongly dependent upon the level spacing statistics of the underlying single-particle spectrum.

The source was observed in the 20-100 keV range for about 100 days, starting at MJD 53000 and ending at MJD 53300. We have analyzed these data using both ISGRI and SPI instruments aboard INTEGRAL satellite. In addition to the main spectral component which is well described by a power law model modified by an exponential cutoff, we find that there are two additional components present in the spectrum.

In particular we study the role played by pionic degrees of freedom for the description of the nucleon s electromagnetic form factors. We show that the inclusion of explicit pions leads to significant improvements over previous calculations based solely on quark degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the EFT approach allows one to systematically include higher-order corrections into the calculation of observables.

We find that there are two types of charge orderings, i.e., stripe-like and checkerboard-like orders depending on the electron filling factor n. The former is realized for 0 < n < 1 while the latter appears at half-filling with spin degeneracy lifted. In addition to these ordered states we also observe an exotic state where electrons form pairs without any net charge. This paired state can be regarded as a precursor of superconductivity. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years much attention has been paid to the physics of low dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes  1  , semiconductor nanowires  2  , quantum wires  3  etc.. These materials have attracted considerable interest because they provide us with unique opportunities to explore novel physical properties which cannot exist in conventional three-dimensional bulk materials  4  . For example, it was predicted theoretically  5  and observed experimentally  6  that carbon nanotubes show metallic behavior even though their diameter is comparable or smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another interesting feature of low dimensional systems is that various kinds of electronic phases may appear due to strong correlation effects  7, 8  .\nOne of the most important issues in this field is how to control the electronic phase diagram of low dimensional systems. It should be noted here that the electronic structure strongly depends not only on the geometry but also on the chemical composition  9  . Therefore, if we could change the chemical composition of low dimensional systems, then we would expect new electronic phases to emerge. Recently, several groups succeeded in synthesizing low dimensional compounds whose chemical compositions were controlled precisely  10 -12  . As a result, many fascinating phenomena have been discovered  13 -19  .",

Abstract : We research the charge ordering dynamics in one - level solids by using the precise diagonalization method and density matrix renormalization method ( DMRG ) technique . We prove that there are two forms of charge orderings , i . k . , stripe - like and checkerboard - like orders depending on the electron packing factor n . The former is realized for 0 < k < 1 while the younger appears at half - packing with magnetic degeneracy dropped . In addition to these organized states we also witness an elementary charge where interactions create interactions without any net charge . This combined charge can be considered as a first of superconductivity . Finally , we discuss alternative experimental realizations of our results . Introduction : - In subsequent years much interest has been devoted to the field of small level systems such as carbon nanotubes 1 , semiconductor nanowires 2 , quantum networks 3 etc . . These structures have attracted considerable interest because they enable us with special opportunities to explore novel physical features which cannot exist in standard three - spatial bulk structures 4 . For example , it was predicted theoretically 5 and noted experimentally 6 that number nanotubes show different behavior regardless though their distance is comparable or smaller than the Fermi wavelength . Another attractive feature of small spatial systems is that numerous things of internal phases could exist due to strong correlation effects 7 , 8 . One of the most key topics in this field is how to control the digital phase diagram of small level systems . It should be noted here that the internal charge strongly depends not only on the geometry but also on the product element 9 . Therefore , if we could alter the molecular chemistry of small spatial systems , then we must expect different electronic phases to evolve . Recently , numerous groups succeeded in synthesizing reduced density molecules whose molecular ratios were controlled precisely 10 - 12 . As a result , numerous fascinating things have been found 13 - 19 .",

In addition, we demonstrate that the spectral evolution seen during the prompt phase cannot be explained within either the SH or LS models. Finally, we argue that the most likely explanation for these observations is that GRB 060912 was actually a single pulse lasting several hundred seconds, rather than being composed of multiple pulses separated by quiescent intervals.

We use two different methods to select cluster candidates, and then apply photometric redshift cuts on these samples to obtain final catalogues with high purity. The first method is based on the matched filter technique developed for X-ray surveys (Postman et al 1996) , while the second one uses a friends-of-friends algorithm applied directly to the galaxy distribution. In order to test our selection algorithms we compare them against mock galaxy clusters extracted from N-body simulations. Our main results are as follows:  1. Using the matched filter technique we find that the number density of galaxy clusters at z < 0.5 is n(z<0.5) = 3.6 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 h3 Mpc-3 .

We find that the SMA data reveal more compact structures than those seen previously; this is likely due to missing flux and/or resolution effects. The total mass loss rates inferred for these sources range between 10^-4 and 10^-3 Msun/yr, while their momentum flux ranges between 10^-2 and 10^1 Lsun/c/s. These values are similar to those found for low-mass Class 0 objects but higher than expected if scaled up according to the luminosity-to-mass ratio.

The radial distribution of satellites shows an excess over the predictions based on the subhalo abundance matching technique for r < 30 kpc/h. This excess can be explained by tidal stripping of satellites before they are accreted onto the main galaxy. In addition, we show that the fraction of surviving satellites decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the center of host halos. Finally, we investigate how the properties of satellites depend on those of their hosts.

We show that reverberation can be generated by the interplay between calcium signaling and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to bursts of spikes which are followed by periods of low firing rate due to depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. The resulting slow recovery of transmitter release causes a build-up of residual calcium concentration  Ca  res , leading to facilitation of glutamate release during subsequent bursts. This positive feedback loop generates sustained reverberatory activity with multiple time scales. Our results suggest that reverberation may play a key role in information processing within neural circuits. Reverberation is one of the most prominent features of brain function  1  .

We find that the night-side temperature is strongly dependent on opacity, which determines how much energy can be transported to space by radiation. The day-night contrast increases as we decrease the opacity because less heat escapes through the nightside atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower pressures where convection becomes inefficient. For low enough opacities, the planet cools down completely during its orbit resulting in an extremely cold night side. Our simulations show that EGPs are likely to have very different climates depending on their composition.

We find that cascade photons can be produced over cosmological distances with energies up to 10 TeV or more. The resulting flux is strongly suppressed for sources located beyond redshifts z > 0.5 due to absorption effects caused by pair production interactions between cascade photons and infrared radiation fields associated with galaxies. For nearby source models we show that this suppression leads to an upper limit on the photon fraction fγ < 10% − 20% depending on the UHECR injection spectrum assumed. This constraint is consistent with current measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray background as well as recent results obtained using Fermi/LAT data. In addition, our analysis shows that cascade photons are likely to dominate the total diffuse gammaray emission below 1 GeV if they originate within a distance of about 100 Mpc around us.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Generating Minimally Coupled Einstein-Scalar Field Solutions from Vacuum Solutions with Arbitrary Cosmological Constant .\nAbstract:\nWe present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 . Even today there exist many open questions about black holes  4  . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",

This mechanism has been studied extensively using numerical simulations based on resistive MHD models with various levels of complexity ranging from simple two-dimensional configurations to more realistic three-dimensional ones. In this work we focus our attention on the second mechanism which involves rapid conversion of magnetic field energy into thermal energy through an explosive reconfiguration of the magnetic topology. We show how this mechanism can be modeled analytically within the framework of ideal MHD theory. Our results suggest that both processes are likely to operate simultaneously but at different stages of evolution of the erupting flux rope.",

We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with free-slip boundary conditions using a spectral element method to simulate the flow field around the evolving droplet shape. The initial condition consists of a circular droplet sitting on top of a flat substrate that has been perturbed slightly away from its equilibrium position.

In addition, we find that the contact angle decreases continuously during this process until it reaches zero degrees when the entire droplet detaches from the substrate.

In specifically , we learn that carbon monoxide could become depleted by numerous orders of large comparable to its concentrations predicted by molecular equilibrium models .

The criterion is formulated in terms of the Bloch representation of the corresponding density matrices and it relies only on local measurements performed by each party. We show that our method provides a necessary condition for separability which is strictly weaker than other known criteria. Finally we illustrate its usefulness with some examples. Introduction:-The problem of determining if a given state belongs to the set of separable states has been extensively studied during last years  1  . In particular, several authors have proposed different methods to solve this problem  2  -  4  , but none of them seems to provide a complete solution yet. Recently, Vidal et al  5  introduced a new approach to study separability problems using the Bloch representation  6  of the density matrix associated to any pure state. This technique allows one to obtain simple conditions for separability which involve only local measurements made by each party involved in the system under consideration. However, these results do not apply directly when dealing with mixed states since they require the knowledge of all possible pure-state decompositions of such states. Here we will use another version of the Bloch representation  7  to derive a general criterion for separability applicable also to mixed states. Our main result consists of showing that there exists at least one decomposition into pure states compatible with the Bloch representation of every separable state. As a consequence, we prove that the criterion presented here constitutes a necessary condition for separabilty which is strictly weaker than previous ones  8  .\nPreliminaries:-In what follows we consider N-partite systems described by Hilbert spaces H 1 ,H 2 ...H N .

The game s persistent world is divided into regions that are connected via player movement between them. Each region contains a large number of individual households containing up to several hundred characters each. Our model uses this household-level information along with character-to-character contact rates inferred from the observed movements within the game to simulate disease transmission at both regional and global scales.

We find that, for reasonable values of parameters, such ADAFs can produce luminosities as high as those observed in quasars without violating any observational constraints on their mass inflow rates or temperatures at large radii. The main reason why our model works well is because it naturally produces an outflowing wind component whose kinetic energy flux greatly exceeds its thermal energy flux. This wind carries away most of the angular momentum so that the flow becomes nearly Keplerian near the black hole horizon. In addition, we show that this wind also provides enough pressure support against gravity to prevent the gas density from becoming too low there.

The obtained results are discussed within the framework of the recently developed concept of ``inverse condensation  . Introduction: In recent years there has been growing interest in studying strongly correlated systems where competing interactions lead to complex phase diagrams exhibiting various exotic phases such as valence bond solids (VBS), charge density waves (CDW) or supersolids  1-3 . One of the most interesting examples is provided by layered quantum antiferromagnets  4  . These compounds consist of weakly coupled planes of spins arranged into a regular lattice structure. Due to strong geometrical frustration caused by competing nearest-neighbor exchange interactions J1 along the chain direction and J2 across the chains, these materials exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena ranging from conventional Néel order at low temperatures down to disordered paramagnetic phases  5  .\nIn this work we consider two prototypical representatives of this class of materials: CuGeO3  6  , where each plane consists of edge-sharing tetrahedra forming a honeycomb-like network  7, 8  , and BaCo2As2  9  , where the planes are made up of corner-sharing triangles  10  .

In addition we sense numerous small knots embedded within the shell . These knots could be remnants of large stars or protostars formed during an earlier stage of star formed activity in this region .

This suggests that the physical mechanisms responsible for generating these events operate over a long variety of spectrum . These results give further basis for the notion that the region called as drifting subpulses could arise through some type of plasma instability operating on the open field poles near the magnetic poles of magnetic stars .

We consider both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state to examine how the MRI depends on the thermodynamics of the gas. In all cases we find that the growth rate of the fastest growing mode agrees well with linear theory predictions when normalized appropriately. However, there are significant differences between our runs depending upon whether or not they have reached steady-state equilibrium. For example, the saturated level of stress achieved at late times varies significantly among different models. This suggests that it may be difficult to accurately predict the saturation amplitude of the MRI unless one can perform very high resolution calculations which evolve over many orbital periods. Finally, we show that the inclusion of radiative cooling has little effect on the properties of the turbulence generated by the MRI.",

We find that the temperature dependence of the static susceptibility χ0 is well described by the Curie-Weiss law with an antiferromagnetic Weiss constant θ = -26 K, indicating strong antiferromagnetic interactions between spins. The observed broadening of the elastic linewidth Γel at low temperatures indicates short-range spin-spin correlation lengths ξs ~ 5 nm. In addition we observe a large enhancement of the dynamic susceptibility χ′′(Q,ω), which can be attributed to the development of low-energy spin excitations below T* ~ 50 K.

Title:  Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in the Metallic Phase of Quasi-Two-Dimensional Organic Superconductors . Abstract : We note on decay background experiments conducted to explore magnetic fluctuations and magnetic correlations in the solid component of pseudo - two - level organic superconductor κ - ( BEDT - TTF ) 2Cu N ( CN ) 2 Br ( κ - Br ) . We prove that the thermal dependence of the static susceptibility χ0 is good described by the Curie - Weiss force with an antiferromagnetic Weiss factor Θ = - 26 K , indicating good antiferromagnetic interactions between spins . The reported broadening of the elastic linewidth Γel at small environments shows short - wave spin - spin correlation lengths ξs ~ 5 nm . In addition we experience a large enhancement of the dynamic susceptibility χ ′ ′ ( Q , ω ) , which can be attributed to the development of lowest - value magnetic excitations below T * ~ 50 K . These results are consistent with theoretical predictions for two - spatial systems close to quantum criticality . Our data suggest that the system undergoes a transition into a system where the Fermi surface becomes volatile against development of electron - hole interactions giving to Cooper pairing .

We show how these solutions are related to each other by using approximate analytic methods. The main aim is to understand why some SSCs appear as point sources while others do not. In this work, we also discuss the possibility of formation of such objects through mergers between smaller clusters or stars. Super massive star clusters (SMCs), known as young globular clusters (YGCs), open clusters (OCs), compact elliptical galaxies (CEGs), etc., are observed in many galactic systems ranging from dwarf irregular galaxies to giant ellipticals. These objects are believed to form during violent events like galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and/or gas-rich major mergers.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of luminescence phenomena has been attracting considerable attention over many years because it provides valuable information about electronic structure and optical properties of solids  1  . Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly useful since it enables us to probe the distribution function of electrons excited into the conduction band  2  .\nIn recent decades there have been numerous attempts to develop theoretical models describing various aspects of luminescence processes  3  , including thermal stimulation luminescence  4  -  8  . However, most of these works were based on the assumption that the system under consideration is always close to equilibrium  9  . As a result they cannot describe correctly some important features observed experimentally  10  . For example, the shape of the TSL glow curve depends strongly on the type of material  11  : while in insulators it usually exhibits a single peak  12  , in metals it often consists of several peaks  13  . Moreover, even within the same class of materials, e.g., semiconductor crystals  14  , the number of peaks may vary depending on the doping level  15  . These observations cannot be explained using existing theories  16  .",

This method can also be used to calculate the probability distribution for the time at which the universe ends its existence.

For example, we find that there is a finite probability that the universe will expand forever without ever ending or collapsing.

The redshift was determined using optical spectroscopy obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile within three hours after the burst trigger time.  We find that this event has an extremely hard spectrum, similar to other high-redshift bursts observed previously.  Using our current understanding of the physics behind these phenomena we can estimate the total energy released during the prompt emission phase of the burst to be ~10^53 erg.  This value is comparable to or larger than the energies released by some supernovae.  If confirmed, it would make GRB 060927 the most energetic event ever recorded.  In addition, if the host galaxy mass function evolves similarly to what is seen locally, then the progenitor system responsible for producing such an energetic explosion must have been hosted by a very massive galaxy.  These results are consistent with theoretical predictions made about the progenitors of high-z GRBs.  Finally, we discuss how future observations of this object may help us understand the end of cosmic reionization.",

We find that the IR emission is consistent with being produced by dust heated to temperatures between 100 K and 1000 K; this temperature range corresponds to an observed flux density at 8 microns ranging from 0.1 mJy to 1 Jy. The spectral index of the IR emission does not change significantly during these variations. This result suggests that the physical conditions within the emitting region are relatively constant over time scales as short as one month. These results also suggest that the IR emission may be dominated by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron radiation. \n \n Keywords: black hole physics, infrared astronomy, radio source variability, space telescopes, X-ray astronomy \n \n \n \n Black holes have been predicted to produce intense electromagnetic fields near their event horizons. However, direct observational evidence has remained elusive because of the extreme environment surrounding such objects. One possible way to detect such fields would be through the detection of polarized light emitted close to the horizon. Another possibility involves detecting changes in the spectrum or intensity of the accretion flow onto the black hole itself. Such changes could occur if the magnetic field lines threading the disk were twisted into helical shapes due to differential rotation. If so, they can act like antennae which amplify any incoming waves along them. As a consequence, the local plasma frequency will increase, causing the plasma to become more opaque to lower-frequency waves but less opaque to higher frequencies. Thus, we expect the spectrum of the emission to steepen toward longer wavelengths when the system becomes brighter.",

We learn that the IR emission is consistent with being produced by powder hot to depths between 100 K and 1000 K ; this heating limit contributes to an observed thermal density at 8 microns ranging from 0 . 1 mJy to 1 Jy . The emission index of the IR emission does not alter significantly during these variations . This result means that the physical circumstances within the emitting region are remarkably continuous over time ranges as short as one month . These results also suggest that the IR emission could be dominated by optically narrow thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron emission . Keywords : white hole science , infrared astronomy , radio source variability , field telescopes , X - field astronomy Black spaces have been predicted to produce intense electromagnetic fields near their upper horizons . However , formal observational information has remained elusive because of the severe climate surrounding such features . One could means to obtain such fields would be through the measurement of polarized light generated close to the horizon . Another possibility requires detecting changes in the spectrum or intensity of the accretion flow onto the black hole itself . Such changes could arise if the magnetic field bands threading the disk were twisted into helical forms due to differential rotation . If so , they can act like antennae which amplify any arriving signals along them . As a consequence , the surrounding discharge rate will increase , causing the field to become more opaque to less - wavelength currents but less opaque to higher signals . Thus, we expect the spectrum of the emission to steepen toward longer wavelengths when the system becomes brighter.",

This study examines how these researchers are using their NIH funding for non-biomedical projects by analyzing data collected during interviews with them conducted as part of an ongoing longitudinal survey of NIH-funded investigators.

We use two different samples for our analysis; one is a sample of about 12000 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), which covers an area of ~10deg2 around the North Galactic Pole (NGP). The other is a sample of about 10000 photometrically selected galaxies over an area of ~30deg2 centered on the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S).\nThe CMD shows that there are three distinct galaxy populations in terms of their rest-frame colors as well as luminosities. These are: red-sequence early-type galaxies, green valley late-type galaxies, and blue cloud star-forming galaxies. In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z. On the other hand, less-massive galaxies continue forming stars until today, resulting in larger fractions of blue cloud galaxies at lower redshifts.",

In addition, we find that there is no significant change in the bond lengths between nearest-neighboring atoms when the concentration of Cr3+ increases up to 5%. However, it can be seen clearly that the bond length between second-nearest neighboring atoms decreases gradually with increasing Cr3+ content.

The key idea is that we can use the Feynman-Kac formula to express the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor at finite temperature T = 1/β (where β is the inverse temperature) in terms of the corresponding quantity at zero temperature but with one additional term involving the time evolution operator over a period of length β . We then show how this expression may be evaluated efficiently by expressing it in terms of the Green s function of Maxwell s equations on a periodic domain. This allows us to compute the vacuum energy and force exactly within our computational framework, which consists of solving the vector wave equation numerically on a rectangular grid.

We show that the formation rate of second stars is suppressed at redshifts z < 20 due to photoheating effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The suppression factor increases as redshift decreases because the IGM temperature rises more rapidly than its density. At lower redshifts, we find that the formation rates of both first and second stars increase sharply when the universe becomes reionized. This effect occurs because the ionizing photons produced during reionization heat up the surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms, thereby increasing their Jeans mass and suppressing fragmentation into smaller objects. Finally, we estimate the number densities of first and second stars using our model for star formation history.

For example, if asked whether two objects will fall together towards earth s center of mass, most people would say no because they believe that gravity acts only between bodies that touch each other. However, according to Newtonian mechanics, gravitational attraction does act upon all matter regardless of its position relative to another body. If you were to ask someone else why two objects don t fall together, she might answer that they are connected by a string so their weight cancels out. Although this explanation seems reasonable, it fails to take into account the fact that the force exerted by the string is negligible compared to the forces acting upon both objects individually.

The SMRM images show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures, which are used to transport cold atoms between different trapping sites. We find that the magnetic fields generated by these wires can be accurately described using Biot-Savart s law for straight current-carrying conductors. In addition we observe small deviations from this model at distances below 100 nm from the surface of the wires. These deviations may arise due to stray currents induced in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the wires close to their surfaces. Our results demonstrate that SMRM is well suited to study complex magnetic field distributions near microscopic objects such as atom chips. Atom chips have been developed over recent years as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter waves  1, 2  .

Therefore, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly employed to calculate physical quantities using LQCD because they require positive definite weight functions  4  .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, several approaches have been developed so far  5  -  8  . Among them, the Taylor expansion approach  9  -  11  seems to be very powerful since it allows us to evaluate the expectation value of any observables accurately within statistical errors.

Introduction The Cygnus OB2 association contains more than 100 OB stars distributed over an area of about 50 square feet centered at l = 80°and b = 1° ( Fig . 1a ).

These objects can drive potent winds into their surroundings creating large shocks where molecules could be pushed up to very large energies . If some of these particles escape from the shock fields they will react with photons come from the surrounding interstellar region generating large - intensity electromagnetic emission detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV spectrum . Several research suggest that numerous of the confirmed TeV systems in the sky could be similar to small open clusters like Cyg OB2 ( seeing ed . g . , Aharonian et l . 2005a , b , 2007a .

In this talk I will discuss some recent results about lattice models that provide an alternative approach to studying these theories. The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms. Recently we developed new Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the worm algorithm that allow us to simulate large systems at very high temperatures where conventional Monte Carlo methods fail because they suffer from critical slowing down.

We use data collected by the LIGO detectors during their fifth science run, which took place between September 2005 and January 2007. The search pipeline is based on matched filtering with template waveforms that are generated using post-Newtonian expansions up to 3PN order. In addition to standard cuts applied to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we also apply two different types of physical vetoes:  1) Vetoing events whose SNRs exceed some threshold value when they occur simultaneously at multiple detector sites; 2) Vetoing events where there is evidence of excess power above background noise levels in the frequency bands below 100 Hz or above 1000 Hz. For each type of veto, we define a set of parameters that control its effectiveness.

The folding of the chromatin fiber plays an important role in regulating gene expression by controlling access of transcription machinery to genes. In this review we discuss recent advances on how chromatin folds at different levels (from single nucleosome to chromosome) and its relation with human genome function. We also introduce some new concepts such as  topological domains  and  chromosome territories  that are emerging from high-throughput technologies. Finally, we provide examples for future research directions. Chromatin is the basic unit of eukaryotic chromosomes consisting of DNA wrapped around histones and other associated factors.

We propose an algorithm that is robust to link failures, but requires only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm achieves global convergence under mild conditions on network topology. In particular, we show that if each node has at least one neighbor whose degree is greater than its own then our algorithm converges almost surely (a.s.) to the correct value. Our results also hold when there exists a small number of Byzantine nodes which may deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed behavior. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

A typical example is the average-consensus problem: given a set of n agents connected by communication links, each agent holds some initial data xi(0) ∈ Rm, i = 1, ..., n; it aims to compute the average x̄=1/n∑in=1xi(0). This problem was first studied by Tsitsiklis et al.  5  . They showed that if all agents have access to the same fixed directed graph G, then the average-consensus problem can be solved using a simple linear iterative scheme. However, this assumption does not always hold true since the underlying communication graphs are often random due to unreliable links  6  .\nIn recent years, several researchers have investigated the design of distributed consensus algorithms in dynamic networks  7-10 . For instance, Olfati-Saber  7  considered the case where the communication links among agents change randomly according to independent Bernoulli processes.

We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*.

We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal factor D ( t ) that evolves with rate according to a nonlinear differential element . The solution of this solution depends on the first circumstances and can be found numerically using standard techniques . In fact we prove that if the first distribution has continuous backing then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t * . For times greater than t * the consumption frequency appears free of the initial condition and coincides with the one forecast by classical mean set theories .

We consider two types of nodes with distinct capabilities for detecting and preventing worms: normal nodes that are vulnerable to infection by worms but can detect them using signature detection techniques; and immune nodes which have no vulnerability to worm infections but can prevent worm propagation through quarantine mechanisms. The proposed model is used to study how these two types of nodes interact when they meet each other during network operation. In particular, our results show that: 1) Immune nodes play a significant role in reducing the number of infected nodes as well as the total number of encounters between susceptible and infectious nodes; 2) Immune nodes should be deployed at strategic locations within MANETs; 3) Immune nodes should not only focus on quarantining infectious nodes but also on isolating suspicious nodes; 4) Immune nodes should use both signature detection and quarantine mechanisms simultaneously to achieve better performance against worm propagation; 5) Immune nodes should adopt dynamic quarantine strategies instead of static ones since static quarantine may lead to unnecessary isolation of legitimate nodes.",

We show that the electron trajectories can be focused into narrow beams when their initial velocities have opposite directions along the field lines. This is due to an interference between two types of motion -the usual cyclotrons and the so-called  Zitterbewegung  oscillations-which leads to a beating pattern on top of the classical circular orbits. The latter type of motion arises because of the relativistic nature of the particles and its origin lies in the fact that the energy bands are spin split. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the physics behind phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect or the integer quantum Hall effect at high Landau levels. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of interacting fermions under strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been studied extensively over many years  1  . In particular, it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional filling factors  2  , where the number of filled Landau levels differs from the expected value  3  .\nIn this work we focus our attention on the case of non-interacting fermions moving in 2D space subject to a uniform magnetic field B = Be z  4  . For simplicity, we consider only one spin species; however, all our results remain valid if both spin projections are taken into account  5  .

Title : Magnetic concentrating of charge carriers from magnetic - divided bands : Semiclassics of a Zitterbewegung force . Abstract : We explore the semiclassical dynamics of states in magnetic fields , which are described by the Dirac expression with magnetic - orbit interactions and Zeeman splitting . We show that the electron trajectories can be shifted into narrow beams when their first velocities have opposite directions along the field fields . This is due to an interference between two forms of movement - the normal cyclotrons and the so - called Zitterbewegung oscillations - which gives to a beating pattern on top of the traditional rotating orbits . The last type of move emerges because of the relativistic behavior of the interactions and its source depends in the fact that the energy bands are spin divided . Our results give a fresh perspective for understanding the science behind interactions such as the quantum Hall influence or the integer quantum Hall influence at high Landau concentrations . I . INTRODUCTIO N The diffusion behavior of two - level ( 2D ) systems of coupled fermions under bold magnetic magnetic fields have been studied much over numerous ages 1 . In specifically , it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional solution factors 2 , where the number of filled Landau concentrations varies from the expected value 3 . In this research we emphasis our interest on the matter of anti - interference fermions move in 2D field subject to a consistent magnetic field B = Be z 4 . For simplicity , we consider only one spin species ; therefore , all our results stay useful if both spin models are took into account 5 . In addition , we suppose that the Fermi level falls within the conduction zone 6 . Under these circumstances , the lowest - excited excitations around the Fermi surface are good - described by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian 7 , 8 where v F denotes the Fermi speed , π i = x , y , z denote Pauli components acting on the spinor wave map Ψ ( v ) , π x = −i∂ / ∂x and π y = −i∂ / ( −i∂y ) .

The results show that the looping process can be divided into three stages, namely initiation, elongation, and termination.

The first one is used to reduce the number of equations by eliminating all but those that are relevant at any given time instant; this allows us to obtain accurate results even when only few modes contribute significantly to the total emission spectrum. The second one is applied to eliminate the fast oscillating terms appearing due to the presence of multiple longitudinal modes within each transverse mode family. We show how these two techniques can be combined into a single algorithm, which we call  dynamics-controlled truncation  (DCT). Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by comparing it against other existing methods. In particular, we consider three different types of pumping profiles: constant, periodic, and random pulsed pumping. \nI.

We also observe that EPC decreases as temperature increases up to 300 K. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of lattice expansion due to thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. In addition, we find that the magnitude of EPC depends strongly on film thickness; it becomes smaller when the film thickness decreases down to 10 unit cells. The observed dependence of EPC on both temperature and film thickness suggests that phonon confinement plays an important role in determining the strength of EPC in these materials.

The research questions are: \nWhat do students think about privacy?\nHow does student s perception change over time?\nWhich factors influence students  attitudes on privacy? How can we measure it? What are the implications for OLE developers? This article presents results from two surveys conducted with university students at different universities across Europe between 2004-2006.

Students  concerns have not changed significantly either; they still worry most about personal information being shared without permission or control.

A Trend Analysis Reflecting the Attitude of European eLearning Users . Abstract : The aim of this research is to investigate how privacy topics are seen by users in Europe and what their behavior towards these concerns is , when using online learning environments ( OLE ) . The research asks are : What do kids think about privacy ? How does student s perception alter over time ? Which factors influence students opinions on privacy ? How can we gauge it ? What are the implications for OLE developers? This section shows results from two surveys conducted with university pupils at different institutions across Europe between 2004 - 2006 . It shows that there has been little improvement in the manner pupils perceive privacy since 2004 . Students concerns have not shifted significantly either ; they also fear most about confidential information being distributed without permission or authority . However , some differences were found among nations . In addition , the findings show that women plays a role as good as aging . Finally , the authors discuss alternative circumstances behind the noted trends and give proposals for later research .",

The QD emission line splits into two components with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to about 1 T, which corresponds to the Zeeman splitting energy of 0.5 meV at 4 K. We observe that this splitting increases linearly as temperature decreases down to 20 mK and then saturates below 10 mK. This behavior can be explained by taking into account both electron-hole exchange interaction and phonon-assisted relaxation processes between different excitonic states within QDs. Our results show that the spin-flip time for electrons confined inside QDs is longer than 100 ns even under high magnetic fields up to 5 T. Quantum dot (QD), also known as semiconductor nanocrystal or artificial atom, has attracted much attention due to its unique physical properties such as size-tunable band gap  1  , strong confinement effect  2  , and large oscillator strength  3  .

We show that this equation can be written as an infinite set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are equivalent to each other under certain conditions. The solutions of these equations describe different types of waves propagating along geodesics in the NC geometry.

Introduction -The idea that spacetime coordinates do not commute is one of the most intriguing concepts emerging from recent developments in string/M-theory  1  . It has been shown  2  , however, that if one considers only classical physics then it is impossible to construct a consistent model based on this concept because of the presence of ultraviolet divergences. This problem was solved by Snyder  3  who introduced a new type of coordinate transformations leading to a deformed Poincaré algebra  4  .\nIn order to study physical effects associated with the existence of a minimal length scale in nature, several authors considered various models where the commutator between two spatial coordinates  x i , x j   = ıθ ij depends on some parameters θ ij  5  . Such deformations lead to modifications of the standard dispersion relations  6  and also affect the propagation properties of matter fields  7, 8  . For example, it has recently been suggested  9  that the introduction of a minimal length scale into the description of gravitational interactions could resolve the black hole information paradox  10  . Another interesting possibility is related to the fact that the deformation parameter θ ij can be chosen so that its magnitude decreases rapidly when the distance r increases  11  . As a result, the effect of noncommutativity becomes negligible outside a small region around the origin  12  . Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the noncommutativity of space affects only local phenomena while leaving global ones unchanged  13  .",

Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an excellent candidate material due to its high strength, low density, and radiation hardness at cryogenic temperatures. However, it has been shown that SiC exhibits significant changes in thermal expansion with temperature which can lead to dimensional instability during cool-downs or warm-ups. This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry. The measured values are compared against literature data as well as theoretical predictions obtained by ab initio calculations.

Silicon Carbide ( SiC ) is an excellent candidate product due to its long stability , short density , and thermal hardness at cryogenic environments . However , it has been shown that SiC exhibits considerable changes in thermal expansion with thermal which can lead to thermal defects during cool - downs or warm - ups . This project offers results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) of SiC - 100 over a long variety of ranges using a novel technique called on thermal interferometry . The calculated values are calculated against journal data as good as theoretical predictions acquired by ab initio calculations . It was found that the experimental observations comply very good with hypothesis within the uncertainty limits . These results will be used to improve the model of later spacecraft flights such as JWST and WFIRST - AFTA .",

We show that this new dual field theory can be used to describe both quantum and classical physics with one single unified description. This new dual field theory has several advantages over other existing theories such as string/M-theory or loop quantum gravity. First, it provides an explicit mathematical formulation for describing physical phenomena at all scales ranging from microscopic scale down to macroscopic scale. Second, unlike string/M-theory or LQG, our new dual field theory does not require any extra dimensions beyond those already observed experimentally.

String/M-theory  1  , Loop Quantum Gravity  2  are two examples of these efforts. However, despite their successes they still suffer from some problems. For instance, string/M-theory requires extra dimensions  3  while loop quantum gravity suffers from non-renormalizability  4  . These difficulties motivate us to look for alternative approaches towards developing TOEs. Recently, a novel approach called  emergent spacetime  was proposed  5, 6  . According to this approach, space-time emerges from a more fundamental level  7, 8  .\nEmergent spacetime:-The idea behind emergent spacetime is very simple. It states that space-time is not fundamental but rather emerges from a more fundamental entity. To see why this might happen consider the following argument. Imagine you are sitting on your couch watching TV. You will probably say that the world around you looks flat because if you were standing up then you would notice that the ground below you is curved. Now imagine yourself floating above Earth.

INTRODUCTIO N\nIn many applications it is important to know how accurately one can determine the position where a photon hits a detector. For example this information is needed when designing optical instruments like telescopes  1  . In order to measure the spatial resolution of a detector we need to have some reference point against which we compare our measured data  2  .\nOne way to obtain this reference point is to use a light source emitting photons at a well-defined angle relative to the normal direction  3  , see Fig.  1(a) . If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will come from a small area around the center of the detector surface. By scanning the detector over different angles θ, we can find out what fraction of the total number of counts comes from each part of the detector  4  . We call these fractions the response function R(θ) of the detector  5  . Knowing the shape of the response function allows us to calculate the spatial resolution of the detector  6  .

We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature  1  .

Finally, we provide numerical examples illustrating our theoretical findings. The work presented here was supported by NSF Grant CCF-0635035. Multi-input-multi-output communication systems are widely used in wireless networks due to their high spectral efficiency  1  . In this context, it has been shown recently  2  , that the use of limited-rate feedback can significantly improve system performance at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, the amount of available feedback resources may be severely constrained in practice  3  .\nIn order to reduce the required feedback overhead while maintaining good performance, one approach consists of exploiting channel state information (CSI), i.e., knowledge about the current fading coefficients, to perform joint encoding across multiple transmit antennas  4  -  6  . This technique, known as spatial multiplexing or beamforming, requires CSI at both transmitter and receiver sides. Since acquiring perfect CSI at the transmitter side through training-based schemes typically involves significant signaling overhead  7  , practical implementations often resort to quantized versions of the true CSI  8 -  10  . Therefore, there exists a trade-off between the accuracy of the transmitted signals and the amount of feedback needed to convey them  11  .\nThe design of efficient transmission strategies over MIMO channels with limited feedback remains an open research area  12  .

Title:  Quantization Bounds on Grassmann Manifolds of Arbitrary Dimensions and MIMO Communications with Feedback . Abstract : We consider the problem of quantizing an arbitrary vector in a Grassmannian surface to alleviate its error under a specified rate constraint , which is relevant for inter - input - dual - output ( MIMO ) systems systems utilizing feedback . We obtain upper limits on the minimum achievable error as good as smaller limits on the respective optimal modes by using information - theoretic tools such as entropy efficiency inequalities and data processing inequalities .

Finally , we give numerical representations illustrating our theoretical findings . The work presented here was supported by NSF Grant CCF - 0635035 .

In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately. This result suggests that our approach provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem. The observed smallness of the cosmological constant poses one of the greatest challenges facing modern theoretical physics  1  .
