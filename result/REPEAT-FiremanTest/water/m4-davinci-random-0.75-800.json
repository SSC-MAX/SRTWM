The Assembly History of the Stellar Mass in Galaxies: from the Young to the Old Universe .\nAbstract:\nThe assembly history of galaxies is one of the most important open questions in modern astrophysics, and it has been studied extensively using deep surveys at different wavelengths (e.g., optical/near-infrared). In this work we present an analysis of the stellar mass assembly for a sample of more than 100 000 massive galaxies selected from the VVDS-02h field observed with the VIMOS spectrograph on board of the Very Large Telescope between 0 < z < 5. We use a novel technique based on the combination of photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution fitting to derive accurate estimates of galaxy masses over such large redshift range. Our results show that the evolution of the average stellar mass density can be described by two main phases: i) a rapid increase up to z ~ 2 followed by ii) a slower growth phase until today. This behaviour is consistent with previous studies but our data allow us to study in detail how the build-up of stellar mass proceeds as a function of galaxy properties like colour or morphology.",

The effect is more pronounced for higher values of the initial magnetic field strength. In addition we find that there are significant differences between the radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness obtained with and without CRs which can be used as observational signatures of their presence.

We say that the presence of CRs result to an increase in gas temperature at large radii ( R > 0 . 5Rvir ) due to adiabatic compression of the ICM during cluster development . The result is more pronounced for higher values of the initial magnetic field intensity . In addition we obtain that there are considerable differences between the directional profiles of X - disk surface intensity found with and without CRs which can be used as observational signatures of their presence . Finally , we show that the inclusion of CRs has little influence on the global values such as total weight or luminosity but does alter the distribution of products within the cluster .

We consider the uplink scenario where each user transmits to its base station using an orthogonal spreading sequence and all users share the same frequency band. The objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual quality-of-service constraints at each user s receiver. In order to obtain tractable results, we make use of tools from stochastic geometry which allow us to model the locations of both mobiles and interferers as point processes. Our main contributions are summarized below.  First, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability when the number of active users grows without bound. These expressions can be used to determine how many users can simultaneously communicate reliably over the network. Second, we propose distributed power control schemes that achieve these limits asymptotically under certain conditions. Third, we develop centralized power control algorithms that guarantee performance close to optimality even if only partial information about the channel gains or interference levels is available.

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

Introduction.\nThe main goal of statistical mechanics is to describe the behavior of macroscopic objects (for example, gases) by using microscopic information about their constituents (atoms).

On the other turn , if the disorder function is broad enough so that its times diverge , then the RFP represents a real non - perturbative phenomenon 6 .",

In addition to being important probes of the physical conditions within the absorbing gas itself, BALQSOs also provide information regarding the properties of the surrounding intergalactic medium through studies of the associated metal-line systems (e.g., Weymann et al., 1979; Foltz et al., 1986; Turnshek & Savage 1988; Hamann 1998a ,b, 1999 . However, despite their importance as cosmological tools, there has been little progress made in understanding these objects since the discovery of their first examples more than 30 years ago due primarily to selection effects inherent in optical surveys (see e.g., Hewett & Foltz 2003 ) . \n \n Recently, several authors have suggested that many BALQSOs could be found among infrared-selected sources using large-area near-infrared sky surveys such as the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) (Cutri et",

Keywords : Quasars - - Absorption Lines - - Redshift - - Galaxy Evolution 1 Introduction Broad absorption line quasars ( BALQSOs ) , which show blueshifted absorption features superimposed upon their emission spectra , comprise only 10 % - 20 % of optically selected quasar fragments but can account for up to 50 % of the total UV continuum flow absorbed by intervening gas clouds along the sightline toward distant quasars ( Weymann et la . , 1991 ) . In addition to being key probes of the physical circumstances within the collecting gas itself , BALQSOs also carry information concerning the structures of the surrounding intergalactic system through experiments of the surrounding metal - line systems ( example . g . , Weymann et l . , 1979 ; Foltz et l . , 1986 ; Turnshek & Savage 1988 ; Hamann 1998a , b , 1999 . However , despite their importance as cosmological tools , there has been little progress made in understanding these structures since the finding of their first instance more than 30 days ago due principally to selection effects common in optical surveys ( seeing example . g . , Hewett & Foltz 2003 ) . Recently , numerous authors have proposed that numerous BALQSOs could be found among infrared - selected sites using large - area near - infrared spectrum surveys such as the Two - Micron All - Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) ( Cutri et",

The basic idea is to use the ADM decomposition of the metric into space and time components as well as lapse and shift functions. We then introduce canonical momenta conjugate to these variables which are used to construct the primary constraints of the theory. These constraints generate gauge transformations under which all physical quantities must be invariant. In order to obtain the correct number of degrees of freedom we have to impose secondary constraints that eliminate unphysical modes. Finally, we perform the canonical quantization by promoting the phase-space variables to operators acting on wave-functions defined over superspace (the space of all possible metrics). This leads us to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation whose solutions can be interpreted as probability amplitudes between different states of the universe.

It was found that most GRBs have their prompt emissions followed by a relatively smooth power-law decline lasting several hundred seconds known as the  afterglow  phase (Costa et al. 1997; van Paradijs et al. 1997) . This phase can be explained by synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated behind the blast wave generated when the ejecta hits the circumburst medium (Sari et al. 1998 ).

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

We show that this distribution can be approximated by a power law with exponent 1 + 1/(2 - p), where p is the probability that two fragments merge into one when they are adjacent on disk (the so-called  mergeability parameter ). This result explains why previous studies have found different exponents depending on whether or not merging was allowed. The approximation also allows us to derive closed-form expressions for other quantities such as the mean size of the largest fragment and its variance. Finally, we use our results to explain some recent experimental findings about file sizes in peer-to-peer systems. In many applications involving data transmission over networks and distributed storage systems, it is useful to understand how large the largest fragment will become during the course of the system s evolution. For example, if a network node has to transmit a certain amount of information within a given time limit, then knowing what fraction of the total data needs to be transmitted at any point in time may help improve performance. Similarly, in distributed storage systems, knowing the expected size of the largest fragment helps determine how much space each node should reserve for storing replicas.",

We show that this problem can be solved by solving a linear program with O(n) variables and constraints (where n denotes the number of vertices), or equivalently by finding the maximum matching on a bipartite graph. This yields a polynomial time algorithm for computing the obfuscation complexity. As a corollary we obtain a lower bound on the obfuscation complexity for any n-vertex tree T . Finally, we prove that there are infinitely many trees whose obfuscation complexities equal their numbers of leaves. The obfuscation complexity of a graph G = (V , E ) is defined as the smallest integer k such that removing at most k edges from G makes it indistinguishable from another graph G  = (V  , E ). In other words, if an attacker has access only to the set of all possible subgraphs induced by some subset S ⊆ V × V then he cannot tell whether he is looking at G or G  unless |S| > k .\nIn this work we consider the case where G is a planar graph.

The obfuscation complexity of a graph G = ( V , E ) is specified as the tiny integer k such that removing at most k graphs from G gives it indistinguishable from another graph G = ( V , E ) . In other words , if an opponent has access only to the class of all possible subgraphs generated by some subset S ⊆ V × V then he cannot tell whether he is looking at G or G unless | S | > k . In this research we consider the example where G is a planar graph . It goes out that in this setting one can solution the obfuscation complexity problem successfully using combinatorial techniques . More specifically , our main result shows how to compute the obfuscation complexity perfect via solving a continuous program with polynomially numerous parameters and limits . As a consequence of our results we gain a different bound bound on the obfuscatability of trees . Moreover , we give results showing that the obfuscation complexity could depend significantly from the larger of the largest independent set .",

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers  1  . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity  2  . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory  3  , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc  4  .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value  5  . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane  6  . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system  7, 8  . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3  9  or LaAlO3  10  onto the surface of cuprate superconductors. While these approaches show promise, they require precise control over film composition and structure during deposition  11  .

We find that all four objects show evidence for dense CSM surrounding them at distances ranging between 0.01-0.2 pc. The presence of such material is consistent with theoretical expectations for post-low-velocity-bulge (post-LBV) Wolf-Rayet star winds. In addition we detect narrow emission features which are likely due to interaction between SN ejecta and this wind. These observations provide strong constraints on the nature of the progenitor systems: they require massive WR stars as well as binary companions capable of producing significant mass loss prior to explosion. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. We have analyzed high resolution STIS/HST data for 4 nearby (z<0.1; Xray-selected) type Ibc supernovae in an attempt to determine the properties of their progenitor systems. All four objects exhibit dense circumstellar matter (CSM; nH>1020 cm-3 ) within 0.01-0.20 parsecs of the supernova site. Such densities are expected if these explosions occur following the ejection of a low velocity  bulge  during late stages of stellar evolution. Furthermore, we observe narrow emission features which may be associated with shock-heating of the CSM by the expanding supernova remnant. Our findings suggest that these events result from the deaths of massive Wolf Rayet stars surrounded by close binaries.",

The temperature dependence of the optical conductivity shows that the charge gap opens below TMI = 135 K, which is consistent with previous results obtained on single crystals grown under different conditions. In addition we find evidence for an additional energy scale associated with the formation of excitons near 50 meV. We show that this feature can be explained within a simple model based on electron-phonon interaction between molecular orbitals. Finally, our data reveal that the electronic structure changes significantly across the metal-insulator transition. This finding suggests that the insulating state may not simply result from localization effects but rather involves strong correlations among electrons. The metal-insulator phase diagram was studied in detail by infrared spectroscopy and scanning tunnel microscopy experiments performed on high-quality single crystals of (TMTSF)2SO3.

We find that JVs can be driven into motion by applying either a dc or ac electric field, which is consistent with previous experiments on YBa2Cu3O7-δ single crystals. The JV velocity increases linearly as the applied voltage increases for small voltages but saturates at large voltages due to the pinning effect.

Finally, we demonstrate that the JV dynamics are strongly affected by the anisotropy of the sample. \n \n Introduction \n \n High-temperature superconductivity has been discovered more than 30 years ago  1–3  . Since then, many theoretical models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon  4–9  , among them the so-called two-fluid model  10  . According to this theory, there exist two different types of charge carriers in these materials, namely electrons and holes  11  . These particles interact via attractive Coulomb forces  12  and form Cooper pairs  13  . When the material undergoes a phase transition below its critical temperature Tc, the Cooper pairs condense into a superfluid state  14  . This leads to macroscopic quantum phenomena such as zero resistance  15  and Meissner effect  16  . \n \n However, it was soon realized that the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory  17  cannot fully account for all experimental observations  18  . For example, the BCS theory predicts that the energy gap between the ground-state and excited states should decrease rapidly near T = 0 K  19  . On the other hand, recent measurements  20  indicate that the energy gap remains almost constant down to very low temperatures  21  . To overcome this problem, several extensions of the original BCS theory were developed  22–24  . Among those theories, one of the most successful ones is the Eliashberg formalism  25  , where the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role  26  . It turns out that",

This leads to an infinite set of coupled equations for all orders of correlation functions which can be solved by truncation at some order. In particular we discuss how the results depend on the choice of the approximation scheme used. We show that the inclusion of higher-order correlations improves agreement with experimental data considerably. Finally, we present our recent results obtained within the framework of the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) including up to fourth-order correlations.

For example, when there exist multiple users sharing a common radio resource such as bandwidth or transmit power, the optimal way to allocate these resources may depend on the specific system settings  2  , e.g., whether the users have equal priority  3  , what type of services they request  4  , etc.. Therefore, efficient resource allocation strategies should take into account all relevant factors so as to maximize overall network utility  5  .\n \nIn recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to studying various aspects of resource allocation problems  6  -  8  . Among them, power allocation plays an important role due to its direct impact on both spectral efficiency and energy consumption  9  . However, most previous works assume continuous input alphabets  10  -  12  , while practical digital modulation schemes usually employ discrete constellations  13  . As a result, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to discrete-input scenarios  14  . To address this issue, several studies  15  -  17  have investigated the power allocation problem over discrete-input channels recently. Nevertheless, their solutions either require high computational complexity  16  or suffer from slow convergence speed  17  .",

The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).  We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:  the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.  In both cases we have considered three types of initial conditions: Gaussian random fields generated using the Zel dovich approximation, Gaussian random fields generated using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and white noise.  Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.  However, there are some differences between them at early times.  These differences can be explained as follows:  the Zel dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to other models because it does not take into account the pressure term in the fluid equation; the white noise model gives smaller fluctuations due to its statistical properties; finally, the Gaussian random fields obtained via the fast Fourier transform algorithm predict intermediate values.  This result shows that the choice of the initial conditions may affect significantly the final value of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations predicted by inflationary theories.",

The results show that there is considerable variation between individual clones within each type of cell line as well as between different types of cell lines. This suggests that it may be possible to use this information to classify tumours into subtypes with distinct biological properties. In addition, they find evidence that the growth rates are correlated across generations of daughter cells, which could provide insight into how these correlations arise during tumorigenesis. Finally, by comparing the growth characteristics of normal and transformed cells, they conclude that transformation leads to increased heterogeneity among daughter cells. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process can help us develop new treatments against cancer. However, studying the dynamics of cancerous cell populations has been challenging because of difficulties associated with tracking large numbers of single cells simultaneously. Here we report our recent work on characterizing the growth behavior of thousands of individual cancer cells growing in culture dishes  1  . We used an automated imaging system to track the sizes of hundreds of thousands of cells belonging to several different types of human cancer cell lines ( Figure 1 ). Our results reveal significant differences in both average growth rates and growth fluctuations between different types of cell lines: some grow faster than others while also exhibiting larger fluctuations around their mean values  2  .\nWe found that the growth rates were highly variable even when measured at the level of individual clones derived from a common parent population  3  , suggesting that the observed phenotypic diversity might reflect genetic or epigenetic variations present in the original parental population  4  .  These findings suggest that it should be possible to use such measurements to classify tumors into subtypes based on their growth characteristics  5  .",

The SBT is based on an effective low-energy description of strongly correlated electrons by means of auxiliary bosonic degrees of freedom which represent collective charge excitations. In this approach we calculate the optical conductivity as well as the Hall coefficient for various values of doping concentration n. We find that both quantities exhibit nontrivial temperature dependence at low temperatures T . On the other hand, within DCT these physical observables can be calculated analytically using simple expressions valid only at zero temperature. Our results show that there exists significant quantitative difference between predictions made by these two models. This discrepancy may serve to discriminate between them experimentally.

We find that, during current-induced mass transport along steps, the step edges fluctuate strongly with time. These fluctuations are characterized by an exponential growth followed by saturation after about 1 hour. In addition to this general behavior we observe different types of fluctuations depending on the applied voltage and temperature. For low voltages and temperatures below 300 K, the fluctuations show a sawtooth-like shape indicating periodic changes between two states. At higher voltages or temperatures above 400 K, the fluctuations become more irregular but still exhibit some periodicity.

With decreasing temperature down to 77 K, the permittivity increased slightly while the loss tangent decreased significantly due to the freezing out of mobile ions. At cryogenic temperatures, two relaxation processes were observed in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 kHz. The first process was attributed to the grain boundary effect; it shifted towards higher frequencies as the temperature decreased. The second process was associated with ferroelectric domain wall motion; its relaxation time constant remained almost unchanged when the temperature changed.",

We consider two different models: SIR model and SEIR model. In both cases we assume that there is no birth or death in the population. The main goal of this work is to investigate how the disease spreads through the population depending on its parameters.

Title:  Nonlinear Dynamics of Infectious Diseases Transfer with Possible Applications for Tubercular Infection . Abstract : We explore the nonlinear dynamics of infectious infections transmission in a population , where individuals are divided into three classes : susceptible ( S ) , susceptible ( I ) and recovered / removed ( R ) . We consider two different models: SIR model and SEIR model. In both circumstances we expect that there is no life or died in the population . The main goal of this effort is to investigate how the infection spreads through the population depending on its parameters . For example , if the infection rate is too large then it could lead to an epidemic outbreak . On the other hand , if the survival rate is very large compared to the infection rate then the number of infectives will decline rapidly . Finally, we show some numerical simulations which illustrate our results.

We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature  1  .

In particular, we show how different choices for the 12C(p,γ)13N rate lead to differences in the predicted light curve shapes.  The inclusion of this reaction is important because it affects the amount of 13N produced during the explosion. This isotope decays by electron capture into 14O, which then undergoes β+ decay back down to 14N. If there are too many electrons present at late times (due to an overabundance of 13N), they will be captured onto protons instead of being emitted as positrons; thus, less energy will be released than if no such process were occurring.

We show how this mechanism works for both open and closed universes with positive cosmological constant. The model predicts an accelerating expansion rate at late time as well as a decelerated one at early times. This prediction agrees very well with current observations. In addition, we find that the present value of the Hubble parameter H0 = 72 ± 8 km s-1 Mpc-1 is consistent with recent measurements. Finally, we discuss some possible tests of the theory using future experiments such as SNAP satellite project. Introduction:-The discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe has been made recently  1  . It was found that the universe expands faster than expected if it were dominated only by normal matter  2  , so there must exist another component called  dark energy   3  -  6  responsible for the observed phenomenon. However, the nature of dark energy remains unknown. Many models have been proposed to explain its origin  7  -  11  .\nIn this letter, we will consider a new approach based on the idea of extra dimensions  12  -  14  . According to these theories, our four-dimensional world may live on a three-dimensional surface (3-brane) embedded in a five dimensional space-time (bulk). If gravity propagates into the bulk then it could affect the motion of particles living on the 3-brane  15  -  17  . For example, if the gravitational field of a distant galaxy lives outside the 3-brane but inside the bulk, then its gravitational force would act upon us even though the galaxy itself does not appear directly in front of us  18  . Thus, the presence of extra dimensions leads to additional effects beyond those predicted by general relativity  19  -  21  .",

Abstract : We examine the gravitational field generated by a large scalar point source traveling on an equatorial circular geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole , and we evolve it numerically in two spatial terms ( 2 + 1 ) with the puncture method . We say that the perturbation is dominated by a discrete mode which tends exponentially as life goes on . The growth rate follows good with the prediction made on quasinormal modes for this system . This result shows that the exponential growth could be due to the weakness of the scalar field near the horizon . In addition , we also show that the amplitude of the growing field falls rapidly when the weight of the scalar field tends .

Another exciting concept happened when a neutral element falls into a Kerr black hole 10 . Here again , the move becomes weak because of the fact of the photon number 11 . However , unlike the example of a Reissner - Norström black hole , the generated emission now contains not only photons but also gravitons 12 .

Another possibility is that the black holes become dormant as the ISM becomes too hot to cool efficiently (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006 ) until another merger event triggers renewed activity.

We find that the bubble has a radius of ~40 kpc and contains hot gas with T ~ 1 keV. This temperature is significantly lower than expected if the bubble were filled by shock-heated ICM.

These particles are responsible for the observed synchrotron emission detected on large scales around the bubble.

We find that the majority (>80%) of simulated galaxies have significant warping at z = 0. The amplitude of the warp increases with decreasing galaxy mass, but is independent of redshift for massive galaxies. Warp amplitudes are typically less than 10 kpc, which agrees well with observations.

This implies that there may not exist any intrinsic mechanism within galactic discs themselves that causes warps.

The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time  1  . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski  2  who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

The author considers the possibility that there are five dimensions of space (four ordinary spatial dimensions plus one extra temporal dimension) which could explain some of the observed properties of matter such as entropy production and irreversibility.   In particular he shows how the existence of these additional dimensions would lead to a violation of the principle of entropy increase with time, and suggests that this might provide a possible explanation for the arrow of time. This article is available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403070v1. Introduction:  Time has always been considered by physicists as being fundamentally different from other quantities like position or velocity because it cannot be measured directly but only inferred indirectly through its effects on other measurable quantities.  However, recent developments in theoretical physics suggest that we should consider whether the concept of time itself needs to be modified so that it becomes more closely related to other fundamental concepts such as mass, charge and energy.  For example, string theory predicts that all particles are vibrating strings moving along a multidimensional space called  space-time   1  .    Another approach involves considering the possibility that time is not just another quantity but rather part of a larger structure known as spacetime  2  , where the latter consists of both space and time together  3  .  According to this viewpoint, time is no longer regarded as something separate from space; instead they are viewed as two aspects of the same thing  4  .\nIn fact, many modern theories of quantum gravity predict that the universe contains at least three large scale dimensions - namely length, width and height  5  - while also containing a fourth small-scale dimension  6  .",

The parallax was measured by observing Sgr A*, which is located near the Galactic center, for two years between 2007 and 2009. We found that the distance to the Galactic center is R0 = 8 kpc ± 0.4 kpc. This value agrees well with previous measurements based on other methods such as infrared photometry or trigonometric parallaxes of masers associated with massive young stars. Our result also supports the hypothesis that the Milky Way has an axisymmetric mass distribution around its central black hole. \n \n Keywords: Distance scale, Galaxy, Parallax, Space astrometry, Black holes \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In order to understand how galaxies evolve over time, it is important to know their distances accurately. However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio",

Abstract : We log the distance measurement toward the Galactic center using Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) observations at 22 GHz and 43 GHz in coupled with Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry ( VERA ) . The parallax was calculated by observing Sgr A * , which is located near the Galactic center , for two years between 2007 and 2009 . We found that the distance to the Galactic Centre is R0 = 8 kpc ± 0 . 4 kpc . This value goes good with previous observations using on other techniques such as infrared photometry or trigonometric parallaxes of masers found with large young stellar . Our result also supports the hypothesis that the Milky Way has an axisymmetric weight distribution around its central shut hole . Keywords : Distance scale , Galaxy , Parallax , Space astrometry , Black Planet 1 Author In effort to learn how galaxies evolve over time , it is essential to learn their distances correctly . However , accurate distances are hard to obtain because they depend strongly on the expected luminosity evolution model . For example , if we suppose too large a rate of luminosity development , then the actual distance will be underestimated . On the other hand , if we suppose too small a rate of luminosity evolu - tion , then the calculated distance could be overestimated . Therefore , it is necessary to decide the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any distance . One means to solution this problem is to using radio signals whose ranges can be determined independently through other means . These include pulsars , quasars , and maser components associated with star - creating regions . Among these observations , maser systems have been used most regularly since they give very precise distance estimates . Maser releases are generally found with crystal creating regions where water vapor molecules create into microscopic crystals called as cool grains . When the frost grains expand larger than about one micron , they become fragile against magnetic fall and begin emitting aggressive emission .

Such NBDs were first studied in  10  where it was shown that certain wrapped D3-branes could become stable at one-loop order without requiring the presence of orientifold planes  11  . Subsequently, several authors  12  -  16  have considered similar constructions involving different types of D-branes and compactifications. However, all of these works required some form of tadpole cancellation  17  so that the total RR-charge carried by the configuration vanishes. Tadpole cancellation conditions place strong constraints on the allowed values of fluxes and charges in the background geometry  18  . It would therefore be interesting if one could find examples of stable NBDs which did not require the presence of additional sources for tadpole cancellations.",

The main goal is to investigate how star formation proceeds in these distant objects through detailed studies of their physical properties such as stellar masses, ages, metallicities or dust content.

Our analysis shows that they exhibit large amounts of cold gas but also significant quantities of dust. This suggests that the bulk of the observed infrared luminosity may not come directly from newly formed stars but rather from reprocessed light emitted by hot dust heated by older populations and/or AGN activity.",

We show how this can lead to superluminal communication between two parties sharing entangled particles by using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Finally we generalize the Born rule to allow for arbitrary measurements instead of just von Neumann ones. The usual formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are performed under ideal conditions where no errors occur during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in practice there always exist some experimental imperfections such as decoherence due to environmental noise, imprecision in state preparations, and inaccuracy in measurements.

The PMS star, V773 Tau A, has been observed to undergo large-amplitude photometric variability and spectroscopic changes indicative of rapid rotation and magnetic activity. We have obtained new high-precision radial velocity measurements using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. These data are combined with previously published observations spanning more than 20 years to produce a preliminary orbital solution. Using this orbit we calculate a dynamical mass for V773 Tau A of 0.84 ± 0.04M⊙. This value agrees well with theoretical predictions based upon evolutionary models for young stars. Our results provide strong evidence against previous claims that the components of close binaries evolve independently during their early stages of formation. In addition, our analysis provides further support for the hypothesis that the majority of short-period systems will merge within 10 million years due to tidal interactions between the two components. \n \n Keywords: Mass determination",

Using this orbit we calculate a dynamical mass for V773 Tau A of 0 . 84 ± 0 . [UNK] . This value goes good with theoretical predictions using upon evolutionary models for small stars . Our results give solid ground against previous allegations that the components of close binaries evolve independently during their first phases of formation . In addition , our research offers further basis for the hypothesis that the number of short - past systems will join within 10 million years due to tidal interactions between the two components .

The experimental results show that the forward-scattering intensity is strongly dependent on the refractive index contrast between the cell cytoplasm and surrounding medium as well as on the size distribution of the scatterers inside each cell.

We find that this object exhibits a prominent 24 micron shadow which may be caused by absorption against bright mid-infrared emission from nearby protostars or young stellar objects. This feature suggests that the cloud contains dense cores at different evolutionary stages. Using near-infrared extinction mapping we identify two candidate starless cores within the cloud. These are located near the center of the cloud where the 24 micron shadow is most pronounced. Our analysis shows that these cores have masses between 0.5 Msun to 1 Msun and radii ranging from 1000 AU to 3000 AU .",

The analysis is performed within the framework of collinear factorisation and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al.. We find that the observed suppression of leading neutron production relative to deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects alone without invoking any additional mechanism such as intrinsic charm or gluon saturation.

We show that , for sufficiently depth SILs and small environments , the atom can be embedded within one good of the SIL with good probability . In this system we obtain that the life of the atom is determined by its interactions to bulk acoustic phonons via the deformation interaction interaction . The total lifetimes are found to comply very good with experimental results conducted on cesium carriers trapped at the transition between two dielectric structures . Introduction Surface - generated lattices have been used much over previous years as a method for trapping ultracold molecules near layers 1 – 3 . These systems give a distinct opportunity to explore quantum much - matter interactions such as superfluidity 4 , supersolids 5 , and topological insulators 6 using cool - atom experiments 7 – 9 . In these experiments , laser light is centered onto the surface of a transparent matter which produces periodic potentials along the path normal to the surface 10 .

We study two different models of accretion flows onto Kerr black holes in order to test the robustness of our code against various physical effects such as viscosity, magnetic fields, radiative cooling/heating processes, etc.. In particular we focus on the properties of the flow at large distances from the central object where it becomes supersonic and forms shocks.

Abstract : We give the first results on black hole accretion using our latest numerical scheme , which is built on an implicit - explicit time integration method and using adaptive mesh refinement ( AMR ) .

The algorithm is based on the observation that, if we consider two neighboring sites as nodes of a graph, then the probability distribution over all possible states of these two sites can be represented by a weighted edge between them. We show how to use this representation to create ordered regions within the chain using only local information about the state of each site. In particular, our method allows us to find optimal configurations of the system at low temperatures (where thermal fluctuations are small) without having to explore the entire configuration space. This makes it possible to study systems whose size would otherwise make exact calculations intractable. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions even when applied to relatively short chains. Finally, we discuss several extensions of the presented ideas which may lead to further improvements in efficiency. \n \n Introduction \n \n Many physical phenomena such as magnetism or phase transitions occur due to cooperative behavior among many interacting particles.

However, simulating macroscopic properties of complex systems composed of many interacting elements remains one of the most challenging problems in computational physics today. Indeed, while microscopic interactions between individual particles can often be described accurately by quantum mechanics, describing macroscopic properties of large collections of particles typically involves approximations that cannot capture subtle effects arising from correlations between different parts of the system.

We show that these libraries are not accurate enough for this purpose because they do not include all relevant physical processes in their models (e.g., convection). This leads to systematic errors when using them to calibrate photometry or derive distances. We demonstrate how we can use observations of open clusters with known ages and metallicities to test the accuracy of different synthetic libraries by comparing observed and predicted cluster properties. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on current synthetic libraries. The next generation of space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented amounts of data about our Galaxy. These new datasets require large efforts to be analyzed properly. One important aspect is the calibration of photometric surveys like Gaia and LSST which will deliver precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky. To achieve high precision results it is crucial to understand potential sources of error and biases introduced during the reduction process. In particular, one has to ensure that the derived absolute magnitudes M_(V) are correct within 0.01 mag over most of the color range covered by the survey. \n \n For example, if the distance modulus DM = 5log10(d/d_sun), where d is the true distance between us and the star and d_sun is the Sun’s distance from Earth, then a difference of 0.01 mag corresponds to a factor of 1.1 in distance. Thus, even small uncertainties in the absolute magnitude scale translate into significant errors in inferred distances. Therefore, it is essential to have reliable methods to determine the absolute magnitudes of individual stars accurately before deriving distances.  \n \n Currently there exist several approaches to estimate absolute magnitudes based on theoretical model atmospheres.

Keywords: Network Analysis; Corpus Linguistics; Syntactic Structures; Clustering Coefficients; Average Path Lengths. 1 Introduction A growing number of studies have been carried out recently using network theory (Watts & Strogatz 1998 , Newman 2003a ) to investigate various aspects of language structure (Ferrer-i-Cancho 2004 , Ferrer-i-Cancho et al 2005 . These investigations have mainly focused on phonological systems (e.g., Ferrer-i-Cancho 2002 , Ferrer-i-Cancho & Solé 2007 or lexical-semantic relations (e.g., Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005 ) . However, there has also been interest in exploring other linguistic levels such as morphosyntax (Ferrer-i-Canchos 2006 ) , prosody (Ferrer-i-Canchós 2008) , pragmatics (Ferrer-i-Canchis 2009) or even discourse (Ferrer-i-Canchi 2010) . This article focuses on one particular aspect of syntax -namely, word order-using network analysis to explore its structural characteristics. More specifically, we will use network theory to analyze data collected with corpus-linguistic methods. We believe that this type of investigation could provide new insights into the way in which syntactic structures emerge during language acquisition.",

We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades  1, 2  . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems  3–5  , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models  6  .\nIn recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged  7–10  .

Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of quantum gravity theories defined over spaces with non-trivial topology  1, 2  . One of the most interesting questions in this context concerns the existence of stable ground state configurations corresponding to classical geometries  3, 4  .\nThe simplest example of such a theory corresponds to the case where space-time is taken to have the topology of a torus T 2 = S 1 ×S 1 , or more generally any orientable two-dimensional manifold M g of genus g > 0  5  . It was shown recently  6  that in this case it is possible to define a consistent set of physical observables associated with the vacuum expectation values of local operators O(x), x ∈ M g . Moreover, it follows from general arguments  7, 8  that all correlation functions of these operators factorize into products of two-point correlators < O i (x)O j (y) >= C ij δ(x − y). Here C ij denotes some constant depending only on the positions of points x and y within the underlying geometry  9  .

For this type of structure it has been shown experimentally that the macroscopic elastic moduli depend strongly on the volume fraction occupied by the wires.

In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Strömgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field. By performing numerical simulations for different values of the spin temperature T S , we find that the 21-cm PS has a characteristic peak structure which reflects the shapes of individual H II regions. This peak structure becomes more prominent as T S decreases because the number of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the decrease in the brightness temperature difference between the CMB and the 21-cm emission line. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use this peak structure to constrain the value of T S . However, since there exist many other factors affecting the 21-cm PS besides T S , further studies will be needed before drawing any conclusions on its detectability.",

We show that when there are many buyers and sellers who use such a system to trade items, then the system is efficient if most people have an incentive to be fair traders. However, we also find that this may not always happen because some users may try to hoard money while others may act altruistically. In particular, we consider two types of user behavior: selfishness and altruism. Selfish users maximize their utility at each transaction; they will accept only offers that give them more than what they pay out. Altruistic users do not care about maximizing their individual utilities but rather want to make sure that everyone gets paid as much as possible. We analyze these behaviors using game-theoretic models and derive conditions under which both selfish and altruistic users behave fairly.",

The lack of such features may be due to the fact that our observations were made when the system was relatively faint compared to previous studies.

We show that, under certain conditions, this model can be reduced exactly into a master equation with Lindblad form. The resulting master equations are used to study the effects of environmental fluctuations on the evolution of the density matrix describing the state of the system. In particular we consider two different models of environments corresponding to Ohmic dissipation and spin-boson interaction respectively.

Zero point energy (ZPE) is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to create particles out of nothing. Although ZPE cannot actually exist because it violates the laws of physics, it does provide useful insight into certain phenomena observed within our universe. For example, if we consider the expansion of space-time during the early stages of the universe s existence, then it seems reasonable to assume that the volume of space increased exponentially over time due to the rapid release of ZPE. If so, then the total mass-energy density would decrease rapidly until all available ZPE had been released. At this stage, the universe would consist solely of vacuum fluctuations, i.e., virtual particles and antiparticles existing simultaneously but never interacting with each other.",

The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.   They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.    In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.  We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity s greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1–3. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4–6. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7–10, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11–13.

We show that if an IFS satisfies certain conditions then it can be encoded into a unitary representation of its associated wavelet group. This result is applied to prove that every self-similar fractal set with finite local complexity has a unique invariant measure up to scaling factors. The proof relies on the fact that any such fractal set can be approximated by a sequence of compact sets whose boundaries have zero Lebesgue measures. In particular, we obtain a new characterization of self-affine carpets as those fractals satisfying this condition. Finally, we give examples showing how our results apply to some well-known fractals including Sierpinski gasket, Koch snowflake, von Koch curve, and Menger sponge.",

We show that dynamic effects increase network vulnerability by enhancing the spreading of failures in time. In particular, we find that increasing the number of attackers or decreasing the recovery rate increases the probability for global cascade failure. Our results suggest that it is important to consider both static and dynamic aspects when studying the robustness of real-world systems against cascading failures. Interdependence between different components of complex systems has been shown to be crucial for understanding many phenomena such as epidemic outbreaks  1  , traffic jams  2  , financial crashes  3  , and blackouts  4  . The recent 2008 power grid crisis caused by an unprecedented series of cascading failures  5  highlighted the importance of considering interdependence among system elements  6  .\nIn this work, we focus on interdependent networks  7, 8  , which consist of two types of nodes: source (S) and target (T). Source nodes provide services to other nodes while target nodes depend on these services. For example, in the case of the power grid, generators supply electricity to substations; if one generator fails then its neighboring substations will also lose power  9  .

We show that the formation rate of second stars is suppressed at redshifts z < 20 due to photoheating effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The suppression factor increases as redshift decreases because the IGM temperature rises more rapidly than its density. At lower redshifts, we find that the formation rates of both first and second stars increase sharply when the universe becomes reionized. This effect occurs because the ionizing photons produced during reionization heat up the surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms, thereby increasing their Jeans mass and suppressing fragmentation into smaller objects.

The PL experiments are performed at low temperatures, where we observe circularly polarized emission with opposite helicity for right- and left-circularly polarized excitation. We show that this effect is due to the presence of a strong exchange interaction which leads to a splitting of the excitonic states into two branches corresponding to different spins of the carriers. In addition, we find that the degree of circular polarization depends strongly on temperature and magnetic field strength. By comparing our results with those obtained by polarized Raman scattering under similar conditions, we demonstrate that both techniques provide complementary information about the electronic structure of the investigated samples.

The PL experiments are conducted at reduced temperatures , where we witness circularly polarized emission with opposite helicity for co - and leave - circularly polarized excitation . We show that this interaction is due to the presence of a strong exchange interaction which gives to a dividing of the excitonic states into two groups due to different spins of the carriers . In addition , we obtain that the level of circular polarization depends strongly on heating and magnetic field intensity . By comparing our results with those acquired by polarized Raman beams under similar circumstances , we prove that both techniques give complementary information about the information structure of the explored components .

We prove that there exists an upper bound on the weight of the lightest neutralino , mχ0 1 < 104 GeV / c2 , above which no solution can exist within our context . This limit exists because the LSP must decay into gravitinos before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis ; if its life exceeds 1s then too much entropy will be produced by subsequent decays to fulfill observational requirements . The bottom bound on mχ0 1 depends upon tanβ . For large values of tanβ , mχ0 1 > 60GeV / c2 ; therefore , for small values of tanβ , solutions with mχ0 1 = O ( 10GeV / c2 ) could arise .",

We find that this leads to an additional term in the action which is proportional to the volume form of S5, but does not affect any other fields or equations of motion. The resulting solution has a non-vanishing dilaton at infinity, corresponding to a deformation of the conformal symmetry group by a scale transformation. This can be interpreted as giving rise to a mass gap for all states except those transforming trivially under the unbroken SO(4) subgroup of SU (4). In particular we show how this mechanism allows one to generate masses for all gauge bosons without breaking supersymmetry. We also discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction: It was shown recently  1  , using the gauged linear sigma model approach  2  , that it is possible to deform the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (MSYM) theory in 4-dimensions such that only the vector multiplets acquire masses while preserving N = 1 supersymmetry. The authors showed that there are two different ways of doing this: either by turning on a constant three-form H-flux  3  or by introducing a constant fived-form F -flux  4  . They found that both these solutions preserve half of the original supersymmetries. However, they did not consider the possibility of having both types of fluxes simultaneously turned on. Here we will fill this gap and present new solutions where both H-and F -fluxes are turned on. These solutions have been obtained within the context of type IIA string theory compactified on K3 × T 2  5  .\nThe plan of the paper goes as follows.

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect.

The recent detection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) has provided strong evidence for an early phase of accelerated expansion known as inflation  1  . In addition, it has been shown  2  that these observations are consistent with predictions based on slow-roll models  3  , where the energy density decreases slowly during inflation due to friction-like effects  4  .\nIn order to explain why such a period of rapid expansion occurred, one usually invokes a scalar field called  inflaton  whose potential V(φ) drives inflation when it becomes flat enough  5  . However, there exists no compelling theoretical reason for choosing any particular form for V(φ). For example, if we assume that V(φ) = m 2 φ 2 /2 + λφ 4 /4!, then the resulting dynamics will depend crucially on whether or not the mass term dominates over the quartic self-interaction  6  . This ambiguity leads us to consider more general forms for V(φ), including those containing higher-order terms  7, 8  .",

In this work we study the scaling properties of long-term recordings of the electrocardiograms (ECG) of healthy subjects during sleep using wavelet transforms to calculate the singularity spectrum f(α), which characterizes the degree of multifractality present in each signal.  We find that all signals are characterized by a broad range of exponents α indicating strong multifractality. The width Δα of these spectra decreases with increasing recording length T as Δα~T-1/2 for T<10 hours and Δα~T-3/4 for T>10 hours. This indicates that the ECGs become more monofractal-like when longer recordings are considered.

We show that this concept can be extended by considering not only single metabolites but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as elementary units for measuring entropy. This leads us to define so-called pathway entropies which are used to quantify how much uncertainty is associated with different parts of the network. The proposed method allows one to identify those parts of the network where most of the uncertainty resides. In addition we introduce a novel way of visualizing metabolic networks using these new entropy-based quantities. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by applying it to two examples taken from biochemistry literature. Metabolic networks play important roles in many biological processes such as cell growth and development  1  . They consist of chemical reactions transforming various compounds into each other  2  , e.g., glucose molecules are transformed into energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via glycolysis  3  .\nThe study of metabolic networks has been attracting increasing interest over recent years  4  -  8  .

Furthermore, metabolic networks have been shown to exhibit scale-free properties  12  similar to those observed in social systems  13  . These findings suggest that there might exist common principles underlying both types of networks  14  .\nIn order to understand the functioning of metabolic networks better, several mathematical models have been developed  15  -  17  .

The research of metabolic networks has been attracting increasing interest over past periods 4 - 8 . One reason for this growing interest exists in their possibly application as drug targets 9 . Another reason comes from the fact that they give valuable insights into cell metabolism 10 . For example , the understanding of key enzymes involved in different problems could help to develop drugs against these causes 11 . Furthermore , metabolic networks have been shown to display map - independent features 12 similar to those seen in social systems 13 . These studies indicate that there might exist shared principles underlying both types of networks 14 . In help to explain the mechanisms of metabolic networks easier , numerous mathematical models have been used 15 - 17 . Amongst topics , stoichiometric approaches 18 attempt to explain all different states of a specified metabolic system mathematically . However , due to the large number of states of freedom encountered in such models 19 , it becomes hard to analyze large metabolic networks 20 .

We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum information processing requires the manipulation of quantum states over large distances.

Another possibility is that the bluer component represents a younger generation of stars formed during recent star formation events. In this case, we expect to see some evidence of ongoing star formation activity such as Hα emission lines and/or UV upturn features.

INTRODUCTIO N\nPulse-coupled neural networks are widely used to model various phenomena observed in neuroscience  1  , such as synchronization  2  -  4  , pattern formation  5  -  8  , or information processing  9  .\nIn this work we consider a particular type of pulse-coupled systems known as delay-differential equations (DDEs)  10  -  12  . In these models each node can be described by its own internal dynamics which evolve continuously in time but interact only at discrete times when pulses are transmitted between nodes. The transmission of pulses may take some finite amount of time depending on the distance between two interacting neurons  13  . Such interactions lead to appearance of time delays in DDEs describing the evolution of the whole system  14  -  16  . Time-delayed feedbacks play important role in many biological processes  17  -  19  including brain activity  20  -  22  . For example, it has been shown experimentally  23  that the presence of time delays leads to generation of rhythmic patterns in neuronal cultures  24  . It was also demonstrated  25  that time delays have significant effect on the collective behavior of populations of coupled oscillators  26  -  28  . Another interesting feature of DDE-based models is their ability to describe nonlocal interactions  29  -  31  . Nonlinearity of couplings plays another important role in modeling real-world problems  32  -  35  . Indeed, recent experimental studies  36  suggest that synaptic connections between neurons are not linear  37  . Moreover, they often exhibit saturation effects  38  -  41  .

This newly emerged flux led to the formation of a coronal hole overlying the active region. After the second flare, the polarity inversion line moved toward the center of the active region where the strongest magnetic shear existed. During this time interval, we also found a rapid decrease in the intensity of the Fe xxi emission lines near the footpoints of the loops connecting opposite-polarities.

We find that SPH codes tend to overestimate the amount of cold gas at high redshifts compared to grid-based methods due to artificial viscosity heating. Feedback models which include galactic winds are able to suppress this effect by removing low entropy material from galaxies. However, we also show that these wind models can lead to an underestimation of the total mass fraction of cool gas if they remove too much hot halo gas around massive halos. Overall our results suggest that current state-of-the-art galaxy formation models produce reasonable estimates for the global properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium but may still be missing important physics related to the detailed distribution of metals within individual galaxies.",

The lack of any spectral evolution across this break suggests it was caused by energy injection into the blast wave. We find no evidence for dust extinction along our line-of-sight; however we cannot rule out significant reddening due to host galaxy dust. Our results are consistent with previous claims that achromatic breaks observed in many other bursts may be explained as being due to late-time energy injections rather than jet-break effects. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, Afterglow emission, Energy injection, Jet break, Redshift measurement \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how gamma ray bursts (GRBs) produce their broadband electromagnetic radiation. This effort has led to several successful models describing the prompt phase of GRB emission (see e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but less progress on explaining the origin of the afterglow component. A key feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or  jet break  in the light curve around one day postburst (Rhoads 1999) . Such breaks have traditionally been interpreted as marking the time when the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, causing the flux density to drop rapidly. However, some authors argue that such breaks can also arise if the ejecta undergoes continued energy input following the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000) , while others suggest that they could instead result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008 ).

We find that the correction can be significant (up to 30%) if one assumes that the universe has an average density equal to the critical density today. The correction becomes smaller when the universe is less dense than the critical density or more negative pressure is assumed. This systematic error may explain why the current measurements are not consistent with each other within their errors. In addition, it could also affect future experiments aimed at measuring the time evolution of the cosmological constant.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Dynamical traps and chaotic advection in a meandering jet flow .\nAbstract:\nWe study the dynamics of particles suspended in an idealized, two-dimensional turbulent jet using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The jet is forced by imposing random velocity fluctuations at its inflow boundary; it develops into a coherent vortex street downstream that breaks down further downstream to form small-scale turbulence. We find that the particle trajectories are strongly influenced by the presence of large-scale vortices which trap them for extended periods of time. In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well. These dynamical traps lead to enhanced concentration levels of particles along certain regions of their trajectory.

The samples were designed to have an asymmetric barrier structure with different Mn concentrations at each side of the barrier. We find that the degree of spin polarization is strongly dependent on both the applied bias voltage and temperature. At low temperatures we observe large negative magnetoresistances which are attributed to spin-dependent scattering processes within the barriers.

We show that this system is equivalent to a collection of independent random walks evolving in parallel and interacting via pairwise collisions at vertices. The collision rate depends only on the number of particles present at each vertex; it vanishes for graphs without loops or multiple edges (e.g., trees), but can be arbitrarily large otherwise. This model exhibits interesting behavior even when all rates are equal, including anomalous diffusion and superdiffusion. In particular, we prove that the mean-square displacement grows as t3/2 for any tree-like graph, while it scales faster than t2/3 for general graphs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results beyond the free-fermion case. Introduction: A wide variety of physical phenomena ranging from quantum transport through mesoscopic systems  1  , to population biology  2  , involve non-equilibrium particle dynamics on networks.

The basic idea behind these constructions is that they involve branes moving through extra dimensions of space-time.

Here we report on continuous magnetophoresis-based blood cell sorting using microfluidics. We demonstrate efficient separation of red blood cells (RBCs) from plasma by applying a magnetic field gradient across a microchannel containing RBCs suspended in buffer solution. The results show that our method can be used as a simple yet effective approach for separating different types of blood cells with high purity and efficiency. This work may have significant implications towards developing portable diagnostic tools based on microscale blood processing technologies. Magnetic separation techniques play an important role in many fields including medicine, biotechnology, environmental science, food industry etc.,  1  .

First, they typically rely on batch-wise operation mode  15  , which limits throughput and requires large volumes of input samples  16  . Second, the majority of reported designs only allow for separation between two distinct populations  17  , while more complex mixtures involving multiple species cannot be processed simultaneously  18  .

We have detected several hundred compact sources with masses ranging between 0.01 to 10 solar masses.

However, it remains unclear how they form. One possibility is that massive stars form like low-mass stars via gravitational collapse of dense cores inside Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs; e.g., McKee & Ostriker 2007). Alternatively, massive stars could form directly from turbulent flows without any intermediate core phase (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2006) . \n \n To investigate this issue we observed the W3 region using the Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al. 2004 ) on Mauna Kea Observatory during two nights in November 2005.

In this work we show how these differences in lensing behavior could be used to distinguish between gravastars and black holes using observations made with current or future space-based telescopes such as LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) and WFIRST-AFTA (Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope - Astro-Physics). Gravitational lenses are powerful tools for studying distant galaxies because they magnify images of background sources.  The most famous example is the Einstein ring produced when light passes close to the Sun s mass.  However, there are many other types of gravitational lenses including those formed by galaxy clusters, individual galaxies, and even dark matter halos around single galaxies.  Gravitational lenses also provide information about the masses of both foreground and background objects.  For instance, if one knows the distance to an object producing a gravitational lens effect then its mass can be determined directly from the observed angular diameter of the lensed image.  This technique has been used successfully to measure the masses of supermassive black holes at the centers of nearby galaxies.  Gravitational lensing occurs whenever light travels through regions where gravity varies spatially.  Thus it should occur wherever gravity deviates significantly from Newtonian predictions.  Black holes violate general relativity near their event horizons so they produce strong deviations from Newtonian gravity.

In fact we show that it could be responsible for the development of hot Jupiters through planet - planet scattering mechanisms . The main results are summarized below : 1 ) We give an theoretical model studying the long - year dynamics of the semi - main frames ( a ) , eccentricities ( u ) , and joint inclination values ( i ) of two orbiting observers under the combined influence of special relativity , tides , and satellite interactions between all three observers . 2 ) Using our model , we perform numerical integrations of numerous representative areas showing how the presence of extra perturbative pressures can significantly modify the kinetic parameters of the innermost body over time - ranges extending from millions up to billions of centuries . 3 ) We relate our model to the example of the exoplanetary system around HD 169830 composed of four large planets on extremely tilted orbits . Our calculations suggest that the modern architecture of this system could have been produced by successive scatterings among its planets triggered by large gravitational encounters with other large planets located at lengths larger than 100 AU . 4 ) Then , we explore the possibility that the recently found transiting super - Earths in the Kepler - 16 system could also have formed via similar mechanisms .",

We show that this transition can be described within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory with a nontrivial scaling dimension of the order parameter field. The latter determines the universality class of the transition as well as the temperature dependence of various physical quantities such as specific heat or resistivity.

At zero temperature the ground state of the system corresponds then to a ferromagnetically ordered state 11-13 while at finite temperatures one expects a continuous quantum phase transition into a paramagnetic state 14-17 .

In this work we consider an application of the distance geometry problem to music analysis and propose a novel method for automatic transcription of musical scores into symbolic representations based on the concept of pitch class profiles (PCP). The proposed approach allows us to recover the underlying harmonic structure of polyphonic music by solving a system of quadratic equations with linear equality constraints using convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our algorithm s performance on several classical piano pieces. 1 Introduction\n\nMusic Analysis\nAutomatic transcription of musical scores has been one of the most challenging problems in computer science over the past decades. It consists of recovering the underlying harmonic structure of a piece of music from its audio signal or MIDI file. This task can be divided into two main subtasks:  detection of note onset times; estimation of pitches at detected notes  locations. Note onset time detection is usually performed by applying various heuristics to the raw audio data  22, 23  . Once the note onset times have been determined, the next step is to estimate the pitches corresponding to these events. There exist many different approaches to solve this problem ranging from simple template matching methods to more sophisticated statistical models  7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19-21, 24-26  .\nIn this work we focus on the second part of the problem -estimation of pitches-which is known as  pitch estimation  or  pitch tracking . Pitch tracking algorithms try to assign a pitch value to every detected event in order to obtain a sequence of pitch values which correspond to the original score. A common way to represent pitches is through so-called pitch-class profiles (PCPs)  6, 12, 15, 18, 27  , where each entry corresponds to the number of occurrences of a particular pitch within a certain window around the current time instant. For example, Figure 1 shows a typical PCP obtained from a single-note mel",

In this research we consider an application of the distance model problem to music analysis and suggest a novel method for automatic recording of musical scores into symbolic representations using on the concept of pitch class profiles ( PCP ) . The proposed method seeks us to recover the essential harmonic system of polyphonic music by solving a system of quadratic equations with linear equality requirements using convex optimization techniques . We prove our algorithm s performance on numerous traditional music pieces . 1 Introduction Music Analysis Automatic reproduction of musical scores has been one of the most challenging problems in software science over the past ages . It means of recovering the intrinsic harmonic basis of a sheet of music from its sound sound or MIDI file . This task can be divided into two main subtasks : finding of note onset moments ; estimation of notes at indicated notes sites . Note onset time tracking is generally conducted by using different heuristics to the raw sound data 22 , 23 . Once the note onset periods have been determined , the top stage is to estimate the sounds relevant to these events . There exist numerous different approaches to solution this problem including from simple pattern comparison techniques to more sophisticated statistical models 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 19 - 21 , 24 - 26 . In this effort we emphasis on the second portion of the problem - estimation of pitches - which is called as pitch estimation or pitch tracking . Pitch tracking techniques help to assign a pitch value to every reported occurrence in attempt to obtain a number of pitch values which relate to the actual result . A common means to count notes is through so - called pitch - class profiles ( PCPs ) 6 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 27 , where each entrance refers to the number of occurrences of a specified pitch within a specified window around the current tempo hour . For example , Figure 1 shows a example PCP produced from a single - note mel",

The results show that the network becomes softer with increasing density, which can be explained in terms of an increase in the number of entanglements between neighboring chains. This softening behavior is also observed experimentally for bottlebrush polyurethane networks prepared at different densities. It is found that the simulated stress-strain curves are well described by the Gent model, where the effective spring constant decreases as the density increases. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of bottlebrush polymer gels can be tuned by changing their density. \n \n Soft materials such as rubbers have been widely used in many applications including tires, seals, adhesives, and biomaterials because they exhibit unique physical characteristics such as high extensibility and low modulus  1–3 . In particular, bottlebrush polymers consisting of densely grafted side chains have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding mechanical properties  4–6 . For example, it has recently been reported that bottlebrush poly(ether urethane)s (PEUs), synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization  7, 8 , possess higher tensile strength than conventional PEU elastomers  9 . However, despite these advantages, there remain some challenges associated with the use of bottlebrush polymers in practical applications. One of them is how to control the mechanical properties of bottle brushes since the macroscopic properties depend strongly on the microstructure  10, 11 . Therefore, understanding the relationship between structure and property is important for designing new types of bottlebrush-based materials. \nIn this study, we investigate the influence of chain density on the mechanical properties of bottle-brush polyurethanes (BPUs).

We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually. As a result, other approaches must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars spanning different stages of evolution.\nGyrochronology provides another avenue for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity cycles driven by dynamo processes operating at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003) .

The method is particularly well suited for detecting short duration transits with high signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate its performance on simulated light curves generated by the Exoplanet Transit Database as well as real Kepler light curves. Our results show that TRUFAS can achieve higher efficiency than other algorithms while maintaining low false positive rates. \n \n Keywords: Transiting planet, Wavelets, Time-series analysis, False positives reduction, Planetary system characterization \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Planets are detected indirectly through their gravitational effects upon their host stars. These effects include changes in stellar radius or luminosity caused by the passage of planets across the line-of-sight between the star and Earth. This phenomenon is known as a transit event. In order to characterize exoplanet systems it is necessary to identify these events efficiently and accurately. However, this task has been made more difficult due to the large number of false positives produced by systematic noise sources such as instrumental artifacts and astrophysical phenomena like eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. \n \n To date there have been several methods developed specifically for identifying transit-like features within astronomical time series data. Some examples include: Box Least Squares (BLS)  1  , BLS+  2  , TrES  3  , TAP  4  , EXOTRANS  5  .

Abstract : We include TRUFAS ( Transit Recognition Using Fast Approximate Signatures ) , an effective and complete traveling search pipeline that using quickly approximate signatures to resolve periodic signals in time series data . The method is especially good useful for detecting short duration transits with large sound - to - noise factor . We prove its performance on simulated short curves generated by the Exoplanet Transit Database as also as actual Kepler light curves .

These changes include changes in stellar distance or luminosity caused by the movement of planets across the line - of - sight between the planet and Earth . This concept is named as a transportation occurring . In attempt to characterize exoplanet systems it is necessary to recognize these events correctly and correctly . However , this task has been made more hard due to the large number of false positives produced by systematic noise causes such as instrumental components and astrophysical observations like eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars . To research there have been numerous techniques used specifically for identifying transit - like features within astronomical time cycle data . Some used include : Box Least Squares ( BLS ) 1 , BLS + 2 , TrES 3 , TAP 4 , EXOTRANS 5 . While each of these techniques performs sufficiently good under specified circumstances they all suffer from one common drawback ; they require considerable computational resources when searching for different different candidates concurrently . For example , the most common used technique , Box Least Squares , requires O ( N3 ) operations where N is the long of the time cycle being analyzed 6 . As a result , much of these techniques cannot be applied directly to previous and later surveys which will produce enormous sums of data 7 8 9 .

We have performed detailed non-radial stellar oscillation calculations using state-of-the-art evolutionary models that include overshooting at convective boundaries as well as microscopic diffusion processes. The main goal is to investigate how the observed frequency pattern changes during evolution due to the effects of rotation-induced mixing and chemical composition gradients. In particular we focus our attention on the so-called mixed modes which are trapped in the region where the hydrogen burning shell overlaps with the helium core. These modes show very characteristic features such as large amplitudes and high degree of nonlinearity. Our results indicate that these modes can be excited by turbulent pressure fluctuations associated with the convection zone located near the surface layers of the star. Moreover, they also suggest that the excitation mechanism may change significantly when the star evolves off the ZAMS towards higher luminosities.",

In especially we focus our interest on the so - called mixed modes which are trapped in the region where the hydrogen burning shell overlaps with the helium core . These modes show very distinctive features such as large amplitudes and large level of nonlinearity . Our results suggest that these modes can be excited by volatile flow fluctuations connected with the convection zone located near the surface layers of the system . Moreover , they also suggest that the excitation system could alter significantly when the star evolves off the ZAMS towards higher luminosities .",

In all cases, the best-fit SIE + external shear models provide better fits than those obtained by assuming only SIS model.

Here we show that all known classes of NCSs contain information for expressing adaptive phenotypes using an unbiased computational approach based on machine learning algorithms. We found that each class of NCSs has distinct features associated with their specific function(s).

We find that bulge luminosity is strongly correlated to SMBH mass in both early- and late-type hosts. The correlation strengthens when we consider only those objects whose central regions are dominated by old stellar populations.

We show that if the initial data is sufficiently concentrated then there exists a unique global solution which converges exponentially fast as time goes to infinity towards a stationary state consisting of two Dirac masses located on opposite sides of the origin.

We show that there are two branches of solutions corresponding to either an expanding or contracting universe on the brane depending upon whether the bulk cosmological constant is positive or negative respectively. In addition, we find that these solutions can be smoothly connected by a branch of static solutions which correspond to Minkowski space-time on the brane. Finally, we also consider the possibility of having a change of signature across the brane and discuss how this affects our results. The main motivation behind studying braneworld scenarios comes from the fact that they provide us with a natural framework within which one may address some of the fundamental issues related to quantum gravity such as the hierarchy problem  1  .

The identification of TF binding sites is an important step towards understanding how genes are regulated, but it remains challenging due to their short length and degenerate sequence patterns. In this work we present a novel computational method for predicting TF binding sites based on a random walk model on a one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) lattice representing the DNA molecule. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to several datasets containing experimentally validated binding sites. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as part of a pipeline for identifying putative binding sites in large genomic regions. Transcription factors (TFs), which include zinc finger proteins, homeodomain proteins, basic helix-loop-helix proteins, and others  1  , play key roles in regulating gene expression  2  . They bind specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes  3  and recruit other regulatory molecules such as coactivators  4  or corepressors  5  , or they may directly affect the rate at which RNA polymerases synthesize messenger RNAs  6  .\nThe identification of TF binding sites has been shown to be useful for studying gene regulation  7, 8  . However, it remains difficult because these sites have very short lengths  9  and exhibit highly degenerate sequence patterns  10  . Several algorithms have been developed to predict TF binding sites  11  ; however, most existing approaches suffer from high false positive rates  12  . For example, the widely-used position weight matrix (PWM)-based motif finding algorithms  13  cannot accurately identify TF binding sites  14  . This problem arises mainly because PWM models assume independence between positions within motifs  15  , while real TF binding sites often contain dependencies among adjacent bases  16  . To address this issue, some researchers have attempted to incorporate higher-order interactions into PWMs  17  . Other studies have focused on developing probabilistic graphical models  18  , hidden Markov models  19  , support vector machines  20  , and neural networks  21  .",

The elementary excitations are fractionally charged fermions or bosons depending on whether the system is antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (F).

Our work provides an explicit example of how fractional charges emerge naturally as topological defects in strongly correlated electronic materials. Introduction:-The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxide compounds  1  , together with other exotic phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance  2  , non-Fermi liquid behavior  3  etc., has led to renewed interest in understanding the physics of strongly interacting electrons. One of the most important open questions concerns the nature of the elementary excitations responsible for these novel behaviors  4  . It was suggested early on  5  that the elementary excitations may be described by some kind of collective modes known as spin waves  6  . However it soon became clear  7, 8  that this description fails at low energies due to strong electron correlations. More recently there has been considerable progress towards developing theoretical descriptions based on new concepts like fractionalized quasiparticles  9  , emergent gauge fields  10  , and topological order  11  .\nIn particular, recent experiments  12  suggest that the elementary excitations in the cuprates might indeed be described by some form of fractionalized quasiparticle  13  . This raises many interesting questions about their physical properties including their charge  14  , statistics  15  , and interactions  16  . Unfortunately, despite enormous efforts  17  , a complete microscopic theory describing all these aspects remains elusive  18  . A promising approach involves studying simplified model Hamiltonians  19, 20  whose low-energy limit captures essential features of the original problem  21  .",

More recently there has been considerable progress towards developing theoretical descriptions using on different ideas like fractionalized quasiparticles 9 , emergent gauge fields 10 , and topological number 11 . In fact , latest experiments 12 suggest that the elementary excitations in the cuprates could possibly be described by some type of fractionalized quasiparticle 13 . This raises numerous useful problems about their physical structures including their charge 14 , statistics 15 , and interactions 16 .

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

The initial condition is constructed as follows. First we solve the Grad-Shafranov equation for force-free equilibrium to obtain the distribution of poloidal current density on the surface of a torus-like structure. Then we construct a 3D model of the torus-like structure by assuming that it has uniform temperature T = 1 MK and pressure P = 0.1 dyn cm-2 inside its volume. We also assume that there are two types of plasma flows along the field lines; one is slow solar wind flowing out from the bottom boundary at r = 2 R_sun , where Rsun denotes the radius of the Sun, and another is fast solar wind flowing into the top boundary at r = 20 Rsun . Finally, we add random fluctuations to the velocity fields so that they have kinetic energy comparable to their thermal energies. \n \n In our simulation runs, we find three different phases during the CME evolution. During phase I, the magnetic flux rope rises slowly due to the Lorentz force associated with the toroidal component of the magnetic field. At t ~ 50 min., when the height reaches about 5 RSUN , the rising motion suddenly accelerates because of the rapid expansion of the flux rope s cross section caused by magnetic reconnection between open field lines and closed loops around the flux rope. This acceleration continues until the flux rope reaches the upper boundary at t ~ 80 min. . \n \n During phase II, the flux rope expands rapidly outward while maintaining its shape. After reaching the maximum size at t ~ 90 min. , however, the flux rope starts contracting inward again. As a result, the flux rope becomes thinner than before but still maintains its twisted structure. Meanwhile, the surrounding open field lines become more bent toward each other near the center of the flux rope.

The mean value of p decreases slightly with increasing redshift but there are no significant differences between the two distributions at fixed z.

My first project investigated the effect of planetesimal size on the stability of planetary orbits. Using numerical simulations, we found that smaller planetesimals tend to destabilize planetary orbits more quickly than larger ones because they have higher orbital eccentricities. This result suggests that there may exist an upper limit to the size of planetesimals that form during planet migration.

We find that the DM can be either fermionic or bosonic depending on the values of the parameters involved. In particular, if the UED scale is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies. The results are presented in the context of LHC searches for new physics beyond Standard Model. Introduction:-The discovery of the Higgs-like resonance  1-3  at Large Hadron Collider (LHC), alongwith other experimental evidences  4  , have established the existence of a fundamental scalar field responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry. However, there still remain many open questions about the nature of this scalar sector such as: What is its spin? Is it CP-even or odd? Does it couple only to gauge bosons or also to fermions? Are there any additional scalars present in Nature ? These issues will be addressed once more data becomes available from ongoing experiments like ATLAS  5  and CMS  6  . On the theoretical front, one of the most interesting possibilities is to consider extensions of the Standard Model (SM). One possibility is to extend SM into higher dimensions  7-9 , thereby introducing Kaluza-Klein excitations of all particles  10  .\nIn recent years, several authors  11-13  studied the phenomenology of these theories in detail. It was shown that the lightest KaluzaKlein excitation of the graviton may act as cold Dark Matter (CDM)  14-16 . This scenario is particularly appealing since CDM constitutes around 23%  17  of the energy content of our universe  18  . Moreover, the presence of an extra spatial dimension opens up the possibility of producing Kaluza-Klein states through various production mechanisms  19-21  including decay  22  and annihilation  23  . Recently, it has been pointed out  24 ",

In special , if the UED level is close to 1 TeV then the DM candidate could be a scalar particle which has been recently proposed as a could reason for the PAMELA positron excess seen at large energies . The results are shown in the context of LHC research for different physics beyond Standard Model . Introduction : - The finding of the Higgs - like resonance 1 - 3 at Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , alongwith other experimental evidences 4 , have proved the existence of a essential scalar field responsible for broke electroweak resonance . However , there also exist numerous open problems about the nature of this scalar component such as : What is its spin ? Is it CP - easy or odd ? Does it couple only to gauge bosons or also to fermions? Are there any extra scalars found in Nature ? These concerns will be handled once more data becomes useful from continuing experiments like ATLAS 5 and CMS 6 . On the theoretical front , one of the most exciting possibilities is to consider extensions of the Standard Model ( SM ) . One possibility is to include SM into higher volumes 7 - 9 , thereby introducing Kaluza - Klein excitations of all particles 10 . In past years , numerous authors 11 - 13 studied the phenomenology of these ideas in detail . It was shown that the lightest KaluzaKlein excitation of the graviton could act as cool Dark Matter ( CDM ) 14 - 16 . This scenario is especially appealing since CDM contains around 23 % 17 of the energy content of our world 18 . Moreover , the presence of an extra spatial element offers up the possibility of generating Kaluza - Klein states through numerous production mechanisms 19 - 21 including decay 22 and annihilation 23 . Recently , it has been indicated out 24",

The FCCS has been proposed as one possible candidate to explain the origin of high-Tc cuprates, and it consists of randomly distributed clusters which are connected each other via Josephson coupling. We find that the resistivity increases rapidly when the applied current exceeds some threshold value Ic(H), where H denotes the strength of the external magnetic field. This behavior can be understood by considering the motion of vortices inside the clusters. In addition, we show that the critical current density Jc decreases gradually with increasing temperature T .

Abstract : The vortex dynamics is studied numerically for fractal cluster system ( FCCS ) superconductor by solving time - dependent Ginzburg - Landau equations under an external magnetic field . The FCCS has been proposed as one could candidate to explain the basis of high - Tc cuprates , and it forms of distributed distributed groups which are connected each other via Josephson interactions . We obtain that the resistivity changes rapidly when the applied charge exceeds some limit value Ic ( H ) , where H denotes the force of the applied magnetic field . This behavior can be described by considering the movement of vortices inside the groups . In addition , we show that the internal charge density Jc drops gradually with increasing temperature T . Finally , we discuss how these results could be relevant to experiments on large - Tc cuprate superconductors . PACS: 74.20.-q; 74.25.+s; 74.60.Bz; 74.70.-k",

Introduction.\nThe discovery of extremely low-mass stars has opened up new avenues into understanding how planets form around very cool dwarfs. However, there remains much uncertainty about the formation process itself as well as the chemical composition of such systems. One important aspect of this problem involves determining whether or not terrestrial planet formation can occur within the habitable zone of ultracool dwarfs. To address this question it will be necessary to determine if the atmospheres of these stars contain significant amounts of heavy elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, titanium, iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, silver, gold, mercury, lead, uranium, thorium, and plutonium. It should be noted that while some of these metals are produced during stellar nucleosynthesis others are synthesized only through cosmic ray spallation reactions occurring outside of stars.",

A convenient way to calculate this property is through the so-called sum-over-states approach  10  where one calculates the imaginary part of the third-order susceptibility χ(3) (ω1, ω2, ω3).

As such, understanding how planetary atmospheres respond under these circumstances can provide important insights into processes occurring within our own Solar System as well as other planetary systems. \n \n Here we present the discovery and initial characterization of TrES-3b; a hot Jupiter with a period P = 3.09 d discovered by the transit method. Using follow-up observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, we show that TrES-3b orbits close enough to its parent star so that tidal forces should synchronize the planet s spin axis with its orbital angular momentum vector. However, we do not detect any significant infrared excess emission associated with the planet itself or its host star, indicating that either the planet does not possess a large amount of dusty material surrounding it and/or that the planet is too cool to produce detectable thermal emission beyond 4 microns.",

These short - lived planets are especially attractive because they could be tidally trapped into synchronous orbit about their components , which would lead to strong morning - night contrasts on their features . Furthermore , these planets atmospheres will experience severe circumstances due to large heating and intense emission fields .

The PSE process is described by means of an extended version of the Lang-Kobayashi model, which takes into account the influence of the external driving field on the gain medium and includes additional terms describing the effect of spontaneous emission noise.

The Milne universe has a singularity at t = 0 where all physical quantities diverge. In particular, the energy density diverges like $1/t^2$ near this point.

The results show that the observed relaxation rates are consistent with those expected from Elliott-Yafet scattering mechanism at high temperatures but deviate significantly below 0.5 K. We find that this deviation can be explained if we assume an additional contribution to the relaxation rate due to spin-orbit interaction between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments associated with Pd atoms. This is supported by our theoretical calculations based on density functional theory which predict a large enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength as one moves away from the center of the Brillouin zone towards the Fermi surface. Our findings suggest that the presence of localised magnetic moment may play an important role in determining the transport properties of these materials even though they do not order magnetically down to lowest measured temperatures.",

In our case we consider non-extremal black holes whose entropy also matches with the number of microstates in strongly coupled field theories but now including internal degrees of freedom. This leads us to conclude that the emission spectrum of these black holes should agree with the one predicted by Hawking s original calculation.

We show that PA networks have small diameters if their growth is slow enough; this result holds even when we allow multiple edges between nodes. For fast growing PA networks, however, there are examples where the diameter grows exponentially as a function of n. In addition to studying the diameter, we also consider the clustering coefficient of these networks. The clustering coefficient measures how well connected neighbors of a node are among themselves. We prove upper bounds on the clustering coefficients of PA networks which hold regardless of the rate at which new nodes join the network. Finally, we present some numerical results showing that our theoretical predictions agree very well with simulations.

These types of networks can be generated by using various mechanisms known as  network growth models ; see  4  for an overview. One popular model is called  preferential attachment  or  Power-Law Graphs   5  . This class of networks has been studied extensively over the past decade  6  -  8  .\nIn this work, we focus on two important properties of these graphs: the diameter and the clustering coefficient  9  . The diameter D(G) of a graph G = (V, E) is defined as max{d(u, v) | u, v ∈ V }, i.e., it is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in G. The clustering coefficient C(v) of a vertex v is defined as the fraction of pairs of neighbors of v that are adjacent to each other  10  . It is easy to verify that both quantities depend only on the degrees of the nodes in the graph  11  ; hence they do not change under edge rewirings  12  .",

The results show that in the Λ-CDM model without DE, the growth rate of large-scale structures decreases rapidly at late times due to the effect of CDM. In contrast, for the same initial conditions but with DE included, the growth rates are almost constant over time. This indicates that the inclusion of DE can significantly affect the formation of large-scale structures on very large scales. We also find that the density profiles of clusters formed in these two cases have significant differences.

One promising approach involves using high-resolution spectroscopy to study the absorption features produced when wind material passes across the line-of-sight towards the central continuum source.

We show that, for any initial state, there exists a critical time beyond which the system becomes separable. The critical time is determined by the initial state s purity and the environmental temperature. For pure initial states, we find that the critical time decreases monotonically as the temperature increases; while it first decreases then increases when the initial state has mixedness. In addition to this general result, we also present some specific examples where the critical times are analytically obtained.

On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies.

On the other hand , there are only few observational researchers which directly resolve atomic cells via long - imaging imaging techniques such as HST observations ( Erwin 2004 ; Sheth et l . 2005 ) , partially due to technical difficulties problems with resolving very small structures near the centers of distant galaxies .

We compare these results for different zenith angles and energies. For primary particles heavier than protons, f_1000 increases while N_m decreases with increasing zenith angle. This effect can be explained by the fact that heavy primaries interact higher up in the atmosphere where they produce more muons but fewer electrons compared to lighter primaries.

We find that this quantity is proportional to the volume of the universe at late times, but grows exponentially with time during eternal inflation. This suggests that our proposed measure may provide an explanation for why we do not observe any remnants of the early universe: if there are too many possible histories, then most will have very different properties than ours. The holographic principle has been used extensively over recent years to study quantum gravity on asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. In particular, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes was shown to agree exactly with the entropy associated with the degrees of freedom localized near the event horizon. However, these results were obtained only after assuming that the boundary conditions satisfied by fields propagating through AdS space corresponded precisely to those required to preserve unitarity. It would therefore seem natural to ask whether similar techniques could also be applied to more general spacetimes such as de Sitter space. Unfortunately, while the answer to this question appears positive when considering static observers, it becomes less clear how to proceed once one considers dynamical situations where particles are created or destroyed.",

We show that, for sufficiently strong interaction strength, the system exhibits a transition to a regime where the visibility of the Ramsey fringe pattern is suppressed due to destructive quantum interferences between different scattering channels. The effect can be understood as arising from the formation of bound states within each well of the periodic potential which are responsible for the suppression of tunneling across neighboring wells. Our results demonstrate how the properties of strongly correlated systems can be probed using standard experimental techniques such as Ramsey spectroscopy.

In particular, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate the physics of strongly-correlated fermionic gases  2  , including the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity at weak coupling  3  to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)  4  at strong coupling  5  .\nRamsey spectroscopy  6  has become a powerful tool for studying coherent dynamics in these systems  7, 8  . It allows one to probe the energy spectrum  9  or the coherence time  10  of the system through the measurement of the population difference after applying a sequence of radio-frequency pulses  11  . Recently it was shown  12  that this technique also provides information about the nature of correlations present in the system  13  . For example, in Ref.  14  it was demonstrated experimentally that the presence of pairing correlations leads to characteristic features in the Ramsey fringe patterns observed in a Fermi gas  15  . However, despite its successes, there remain several open questions regarding the interpretation of the Ramsey signal  16  .",

We show that , for sufficiently large interaction intensity , the system exhibits a transition to a system where the sight of the Ramsey fringe pattern is diminished due to destructive quantum interferences between different quantum systems .

The new metric has several advantages over previous proposals, including manifestly positive kinetic terms and no need for additional counterterms at higher orders. We show how this metric can be used to compute beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory using only Feynman diagrams with one-loop vacuum bubbles as building blocks. This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties. In addition we find evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the beta function of the string coupling constant. These results provide further support for the idea that the worldsheet sigma model may serve as a useful tool for studying quantum gravity. Introduction: It was recently shown  1  that the worldsheet sigma-model (WSSM) provides a powerful framework for investigating quantum gravity via its connection to the gravitational path integral  2  .

Instead, the RG flow must take place along some infinite-dimensional trajectory through the space of all possible actions. To make progress towards understanding such trajectories it would be helpful if one were able to define a sensible metric on the space of WSSM actions so that distances between different actions could be measured.

We find that there are three criteria which should be considered when selecting targets for follow up observation; (1) The event duration, (2) The lens mass and distance, and (3) The planet detection efficiency. In addition we also discuss other factors such as weather condition at the time of the event peak, and the possibility of detecting planets around brown dwarfs. Finally, we give some suggestions about future projects. Keywords: Microlensing; Planets; Brown Dwarfs; Follow-up Observations. 1 Introduction Microlensing is one of the most promising methods to detect extrasolar planets because it can provide information not only on the existence but also on physical properties of planets without any biases against their orbital parameters or host star types. However, since the Einstein ring radius of a lensing object is typically much smaller than its angular size, it takes several years to monitor thousands of stars continuously by using ground-based telescopes. Therefore, many groups have been conducting intensive monitoring programs toward Galactic bulge fields during the last decade. As a result, more than 100 exoplanet candidates were discovered so far through this method  1  . Among them, however, only four planets have been confirmed by radial velocity measurements  2  .\nMicrolensing events occur due to gravitational lensing effect between two objects separated by large distances. When a background source passes close enough to a foreground lensing object, the light rays coming from the source will bend towards the lensing object. This causes magnification of the source flux. If a planet exists near the lensing object, additional perturbation occurs in the lensing light curve. Since the amount of the perturbation depends strongly on the projected separation between the lensing object and the planet, the presence of a planet can be detected by analyzing the shape of the lensing light curve  3, 4  .",

(ii) The radion couples directly to Standard Model particles but its effects are suppressed due to mixing between the radion and the Higgs boson. In both cases we show how the radion affects precision electroweak observables such as S, T , W , Y . Finally, we discuss the possibility of detecting the radion through direct production at future colliders. Introduction: One of the most interesting features of Randall-Sundrum type I  1  or II  2  models is their ability to generate hierarchies among fundamental scales without fine-tuning  3  . However, these models suffer from the presence of a scalar field called the radion whose vacuum expectation value determines the size of extra dimensions  4  .\nIn this work we consider the case where the radion acquires a large mass so it does not affect low-energy physics  5  . On the other hand, if the radion remains light then it may have observable effects  6  -  8  . For example, one could imagine that the radion mixes strongly with the Higgs boson leading to deviations from standard predictions  9  .

We find that there is no instability at zero temperature when the chemical potential lies between two consecutive energy levels of the system. This result holds true even if we consider finite temperatures as well. In particular, this implies that the ground state remains stable against collapse into a single particle state (fermionization) or formation of bound states with more than 2 particles (bosonization). The results are also valid for higher spins. Our analysis can be extended to other models such as those describing cold atoms trapped inside optical lattices. Introduction:-In recent years, ultracold atomic systems have been used extensively to simulate various physical phenomena  1  . One-dimensional quantum gases provide particularly interesting examples because they allow us to explore many-body physics in regimes where analytical solutions cannot be obtained  2  .\nThe most common experimental setup consists of confining bosonic or fermionic atoms along one spatial direction within a harmonic trap  3  , which leads to the emergence of quasi-one dimensional behavior  4  . However, it has recently become possible to confine these atoms tightly enough so that their motion becomes truly onedimensional  5  . For example, experiments performed with Bose-Einstein condensates  6  and degenerate Fermi gases  7, 8  show that confinement in a narrow channel gives rise to new phases of matter  9  . These include superfluidity  10  , supersolids  11  , Luttinger liquids  12  , Tonks-Girardeau gas  13  , and Mott insulators  14  . It would therefore be very useful to develop theoretical tools capable of predicting the properties of these novel phases  15  .\nOne of the main challenges associated with studying strongly correlated quantum systems is determining whether certain configurations are energetically favorable  16  .

Abstract : We explore the stability of spin - 1 / 2 fermions restricted to one side by an external force and emerging via contact interactions , using the Bethe ansatz solution for the Lieb - Liniger model . We prove that there is no behavior at zero temperature when the molecular field stands between two consecutive energy concentrations of the system . This result stands true albeit if we consider discrete values as also . In fact , this asserts that the ground system becomes invariant against fall into a single molecule system ( fermionization ) or development of bound states with more than 2 molecules ( bosonization ) . The results are also useful for higher spins . Our model can be applied to other models such as those concerning cool molecules trapped inside optical lattices . Introduction : - In subsequent years , ultracold atomic systems have been used significantly to simulate numerous physical events 1 . One - higher quantum systems give especially exciting instance because they enable us to explore much - matter mechanics in regimes where theoretical solutions cannot be found 2 . The most common experimental setup follows of confining bosonic or fermionic molecules along one spatial path within a harmonic trap 3 , which gives to the development of pseudo - one spatial behavior 4 . However , it has recently become easier to confine these atoms tightly sufficient so that their movement becomes fully onedimensional 5 . For example , experiments conducted with Bose - Einstein condensates 6 and degenerate Fermi fluids 7 , 8 show that trapping in a narrow system gives rise to different phases of matter 9 . These include superfluidity  10  , supersolids  11  , Luttinger liquids  12  , Tonks-Girardeau gas  13  , and Mott insulators  14  . It would therefore be very useful to develop theoretical tools useful of predicting the features of these novel phases 15 . One of the main challenges involved with studying strongly correlated quantum systems is determining whether certain configurations are energetically favorable 16 . If the answer goes out to be yes , then we say that the configuration is metastable 17 . On the other hand , if the answer is no , then the configuration is unstable 18 .

We show that reverberation can be generated by the interplay between calcium signaling and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to bursts of spikes which are followed by periods of low firing rate due to depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. The resulting slow recovery of transmitter release causes a build-up of residual calcium concentration  Ca  res , leading to facilitation of glutamate release during subsequent bursts. This positive feedback loop generates sustained reverberatory activity with multiple time scales. Our results suggest that reverberation may play a key role in information processing within neural circuits. Reverberation is one of the most prominent features of brain function  1  .

For example, if a virus infects a bacterium, then its genes will be passed horizontally across the host cell membrane  5  ; similarly, if a plant hybridizes with another plant  6  , then the offspring inherits genetic material from both parents  7, 8  . In these examples, the process of HGT results in a network-like relationship between the descendants of the original ancestor(s), rather than a strict hierarchy  9  .",

Introduction The reconstruction of evolved interactions among biological beings has been one of the main problems in science since Darwin s On the Origin of Species was written 150 centuries ago 1 . The most generally accepted model of evolve assumes that different species evolve over time via vertical transmission - that is , they pass their genetic content down directly from mother to offspring 2 . However , there are numerous circumstances where we cannot suppose that evolve continues purely directly ; rather , some type of lateral generation exchange ( HG T ) happened between two lineages 3 , resulting in what is called as reticulate progression 4 . For example , if a virus infects a virus , then its genes will be distributed directly across the host cell cell 5 ; also , if a species hybridizes with another crop 6 , then the offspring inherits genetic content from both fathers 7 , 8 . In these instance , the method of HGT results in a system - like model between the descendants of the founding ancestor ( s ) , rather than a formal level 9 .",

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al. (2008) used SDSS DR4 data to investigate the alignments between galaxy spin vectors and their nearest neighbor s position angles. They found no",

We show that in this case it is possible to obtain accurate results using only two parameters instead of three as was previously thought necessary (the third parameter being the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the shell s thickness). The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration. This makes our approach much faster than previous methods while retaining high accuracy. Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth s crust to tectonic stresses and other processes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition. It also has applications in geophysics beyond Earth sciences including planetary science, astrophysics and seismology. \nTheory\n\nIn order to study the deformation of the Earth s crust we need to know how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate boundary interactions like subduction zones and transform faults. To do so, we use the theory of elasticity to find solutions to problems involving the interaction between plates and their underlying mantle. However, solving these problems analytically requires simplifying assumptions about the geometry of the system and the mechanical properties of the materials involved. \n\nOne important simplification made when studying the mechanics of plate boundaries is to assume that they behave as if they were composed of thin elastic shells.

Title : Thin elastic layers with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of one - surface planets . Abstract : We give an analytical solution to the problem of bending narrow elastic movies with variable thickness under surface loads , which is relevant to the problem where the shell s thickness varies by numerous orders of large over its thickness and where the weight distribution is not necessarily axisymmetric . We show that in this fact it is could to obtain accurate results using only two parameters rather of three as was previously considered necessary ( the third variable being the sum between the maximum and minimum values of the shell s thickness ) . The modern formulation allows us to estimate the deflection of the shell at any plane on its surface without having to solution extra equations or perform numerical integration . This gives our method much faster than previous techniques while retention large efficiency . Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth s sheet to tectonic stresses and other changes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition . It also has applied in geophysics beyond Earth systems including planetary science , astrophysics and seismology . Theory In attempt to research the deformation of the Earth s crust we need to learn how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet . In especially , we are concerned in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate border interactions like subduction zones and transform faults . To do so , we using the concept of elasticity to seek solutions to problems relating the interaction between plates and their internal mantle . However , solving these problems analytically requires simplifying parameters about the geometry of the system and the mechanical values of the components involved . One key simplification made when studying the mechanics of plate barriers is to expect that they react as if they were composed of narrow elastic layers . These structures have been shown to give good approximations to more realistic models of plate structures because they enable for rapid calculations of the stress fields within them . For example , Figure 1 shows a comparison between the predictions made using a simple shaped shell model and those produced by a finite element model of the San Andreas Fault System .

We show that this leads to new effects such as photon bunching at zero time delay and antibunching at nonzero delays. These results are compared against experimental data obtained using SPDC sources based on periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides. The theoretical model is also used to predict the effect of varying pump bandwidths and crystal lengths on the degree of second-order coherence g(2)(0) measured experimentally. This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP/G037656/1. \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in quantum optics experiments involving broadband down-conversion  1–3 . Such experiments have led to demonstrations of novel phenomena such as single-photon switching  4 , sub-Poissonian statistics  5 , squeezing  6 , and nonclassical correlations  7, 8 . However, many aspects of these experiments remain poorly understood due to difficulties associated with modelling the complicated nonlinear processes involved  9, 10 .

This project was backed by EPSRC grant EP / G037656 / 1 . In subsequent years there has been growing interest in quantum optics experiments concerning wireless down - transition 1 – 3 . Such experiments have brought to demonstrations of novel experiments such as single - photon correlation 4 , sub - Poissonian statistics 5 , squeezing 6 , and nonclassical correlations 7 , 8 . However , much details of these experiments exist poorly realized due to difficulties attributed with studying the intricate nonlinear systems involved 9 , 10 . Here we develop an integrated account of two - photon interactions in wider - wave down - shifted light which contains both spatial and spatial forms of freedom 11 , 12 . Our method requires us to estimate the joint propagation intensity distribution of the down - applied field 13 , which can then be used to decide the density density distribution relating the arrival hours of sets of photons produced via spontaneous parametric downconversion 14 – 18 . As good as providing knowledge into the dynamics surrounding wireless down - transition experiments , our research enables quantitative predictions about the responses of such systems to be made .",

We find that the inclusion of new particles such as vector-like quarks and leptons can significantly affect the running behavior of gauge couplings. In particular, it is found that the presence of these new particles leads to an enhancement effect on the evolution speed of gauge couplings which may be helpful to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. Furthermore, by using the experimental data of low energy physics, we obtain some constraints on the mass spectrum of extra particles involved in our model.

This correlation persists even when we consider only those pairs whose mutual separation lies along the line-of-sight between them.

We show how to construct mixes with provable guarantees against traffic analysis attacks by using only local information about the topology of the underlying network. Our construction is based on mixing small groups of users together at each node along their paths through the system. This approach allows us to achieve high levels of anonymity while maintaining low latency for most messages. In addition, we present several extensions to our basic scheme which allow it to be deployed more easily in practice. Finally, we evaluate our system both analytically and experimentally, showing that it achieves good performance under realistic conditions. Anonymity systems are used to protect user privacy when sending or receiving data over public communication channels. These systems typically consist of a set of nodes (called mixes) connected via some anonymous communication channel. Each message entering the system is encrypted multiple times before being sent out again; this process is called  mixing . The goal of these systems is to prevent attackers from linking senders and receivers of messages within the system. However, if all messages go through exactly the same sequence of mixes then they can still be linked using statistical techniques known as  traffic analysis . Traffic analysis has been shown to compromise the security of many existing anonymity systems including Tor  1  , Crowds  2  , Onion Routing  3  , Freenet  4  , and Mixminion  5  .

In addition , we include numerous extensions to our standard scheme which enable it to be installed more easily in practice . Finally , we evaluate our system both analytically and experimentally , showing that it achieves good performance under realistic circumstances . Anonymity systems are used to protect user privacy when sending or receiving data over public transmission networks . These systems generally comprise of a setting of networks ( called mixes ) connected via some unknown transmission source . Each message entering the system is encrypted numerous twice before being sending out again ; this method is called mixing . The goal of these systems is to avoid attackers from connecting senders and receivers of messages within the system . However , if all messages go through perfect the same pattern of mixes then they can also be connected using statistical techniques called as traffic analysis . Traffic information has been shown to harm the security of numerous traditional anonymity systems including Tor 1 , Crowds 2 , Onion Routing 3 , Freenet 4 , and Mixminion 5 . To overcome this problem , researchers have proposed numerous approaches 6 - 8 . In this effort , we emphasis on anonymity systems operating over unstructured networks 9 - 11 . Unstructured networks differ from traditional home - to - share networks 12 because there is no global knowledge information concerning the structure of the system . Instead , each node possesses only partial information about its immediate surroundings . For example , in the instance of Tor 13 , each node recognizes only the ID of its immediate friends but not those of other connections further away . As another example , in Mixminion 14 , each node cares only whether two different vertices are directly connected or not",

We find that the observed gamma-ray luminosity is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the assumption that the energy density of relativistic particles follows closely that of thermal plasma, as expected for hadronic models where cosmic rays are accelerated at shocks driven into intracluster medium by mergers or AGN activity. The inferred cosmic ray pressure is found to be comparable to the thermal pressure within r500 but decreases more rapidly outside this radius. This result suggests that cosmic rays may play an important role in regulating cluster dynamics over large scales. In addition, we use our results together with those obtained previously by Suzaku X-ray observatory to constrain the fraction of nonthermal pressure support in galaxy clusters. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of cosmic rays to total pressure can reach up to 30%-40% inside r500 while it drops below 10% beyond 2r500.

The DNP effect was studied by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at X-band frequencies using a home-built high-field spectrometer equipped with a commercial microwave bridge operating at 2.5 GHz. We found that the enhancement factor increases strongly when approaching the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature TNI = 35 °C. This finding can be explained by assuming that the molecular mobility decreases rapidly as TNI is approached. In addition to this observation we find that the maximum achievable enhancement factor depends critically on the sample geometry. For samples having a thickness d < 1 mm it reaches values up to 100 times larger than those observed for thicker samples. These results are important for future applications of DNP in NMR experiments performed under extreme conditions such as low temperatures or strong magnetic fields.",

These data are combined with previously published radial velocities in order to determine the mass of this object. We find that it is most likely an M dwarf star with a mass between 0.3 and 1.0 times that of Jupiter s mass. The orbital parameters derived here agree well with those determined by previous authors using different techniques. This system may be similar to our own solar system at early stages of formation when planets were still forming around young stars. Keywords: Extrasolar planet -Astrometry -Radial velocity -HST -Mass determination -HD 33636 . \nIntroduction\n\nThe detection of extrasolar giant planets has been one of the major accomplishments of modern astronomy over the past decade. However, only about 10% of all known planetary systems contain such massive objects. Most of these have been discovered through high-precision Doppler spectroscopy or direct imaging methods. In contrast, very few low-mass companions have been found so far because they produce smaller reflex motions and/or lower luminosity than their more massive counterparts. As a result, there exists a large gap in the distribution of masses among known extra-solar planets ranging from several Earth masses down to Neptune-like masses. It is therefore important to search for low-mass companions as well since they can provide valuable information regarding the formation process of planetary systems. \n \n One possible way to detect low-mass companions is to use high-angular resolution observations made with space-based telescopes like HST. Such observations allow us to measure the position angle of the host star relative to its nearby neighbors. If we assume that the observed motion is due solely to gravitational interaction with another body then we can derive the projected separation and position angle of the companion. By combining these results with accurate radial-velocity measurements taken simultaneously, we can obtain the full three-dimensional orbit of the companion which allows us to calculate its mass.",

Introduction The observation of extrasolar giant planets has been one of the key achievement of modern astronomy over the past decade . However , only about 10 % of all confirmed planetary systems include such large structures . Most of these have been found through long - speed Doppler spectroscopy or direct imaging techniques . In comparison , very few lowest - weight planets have been found so much because they produce smaller angular orbits and / or less luminosity than their more large counterparts . As a result , there exists a large divide in the distribution of values among confirmed extra - solar planets ranging from small Earth pounds down to Neptune - like values . It is therefore essential to search for small - weight planets as also since they can give valuable information concerning the development transition of planetary systems . One could means to predict small - weight planets is to using large - angular depth observations made with distance - station telescopes like HST . Such observations enable us to estimate the alignment angle of the host star according to its adjacent neighbors . If we suppose that the seen move is due solely to gravitational interaction with another body then we can obtain the projected distance and orbit distance of the companion . By merging these results with accurate companion - speed observations took continuously , we can obtain the complete three - color orbit of the companion which enable us to estimate its weight .",

Our sample contains all sources listed as  blazar candidates  in the Third EGRET Catalog (3EG), which includes 157 objects.

These additional sources were found through cross-correlation between the Véron-Cetty & Véron catalog of active galactic nuclei and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. Using this combined sample consisting of 161 blazars, we calculate the fraction of flat-spectrum (FSRQ-like) and steep-spectrum (BL Lac-like) blazars among the total number of blazars observed by EGRET. This fraction depends strongly on the assumed value of the high-energy cutoff E_cutof f . For example, if we assume E_cutof f = 10 GeV, then FSRQ-like blazars constitute about 80% of the entire population; however, if we adopt an extremely low value such as 1 MeV, only 20% of the blazars can be classified as FSRQ-like.",

We use an agent-based model to simulate how communities evolve over time under different environmental conditions. Our results suggest that biodiversity cycles may have played an important role in shaping Earth s biosphere throughout its history.

This action contains a Chern-Simons term coupled to a set of charged scalar fields representing fluctuations around the mean-field solution corresponding to the filled lowest Landau level.

In help to explain fully the role role by spatial in the growth of cooperation , different authors have studied the development of cooperation in spatially - structured communities 9 . These writings generally consider two main classes of models : subset - built 10 and agent - built 11 . Lattice - independent models suppose that the entire population runs on a regular grid 12 while agent - built models enable for arbitrary topologies 13 . Despite the differences between both approaches , most previous research accepts that the topology of the overall system plays a key role in determining whether cooperation will be effective to thrive 14 .",

We derive exact expressions for ergodic capacity and outage probability over such channels under wideband regime (i.e., when bandwidth grows without bound). Our results show that both ergodic capacity and outages are determined by the number of paths N , their average power Pn = E{|hn(t)|2}, and delay spread T . In particular, we find that ergodic capacity scales linearly with bandwidth W at high SNR if N > 2W/πT or N < πT /4W; otherwise it saturates to a constant value. Moreover, our analysis shows that outage probability decays exponentially fast with increasing bandwidth W if N > 4W/πT ; otherwise it decreases only polynomially.

NoCs are expected to be the dominant communication infrastructure in future multi-core and many-core processors, which will require high bandwidth and low latency communications between cores. However, traditional electrical NoCs suffer from power consumption issues due to their limited scalability with increasing core count.

The proposed NoC consists of two main components; photonic routers and optoelectronic transceivers. Photonic routers use silicon photonics technology to route data packets through multiple channels simultaneously using wavelength division multiplexing technique.

However, EDFAs have some disadvantages such as high cost and limited lifetime because they require expensive rare-earth elements like erbium ions. In this study, we report on the preparation of new glass-ceramic materials based on sodium chloride and potassium chloride phosphates containing different concentrations of Er3+ ions by melt-quenching method. The structural characterization was performed using X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature between 300 nm and 1600 nm. Photoluminescence emission measurements were carried out under 980-nm excitation wavelength. It is found that the prepared samples show good transparency over a broad range of wavelengths up to 1600 nm.",

The observed properties of these winds are consistent with those predicted for massive (M > 1010 M⊙) star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. We also find evidence that the gas is being accelerated up to velocities as large as 1000 km s-1 . These results suggest that such winds may play an important role in regulating galaxy evolution over cosmic time.  Keywords: Galaxy Evolution; Star Formation; Winds Galaxies evolve through mergers and interactions between their constituent dark matter halos and baryonic components. In addition, they grow via accretion onto existing structures or by forming new stars within them. However, it remains unclear how this growth proceeds on small scales. Recent observations have shown that many nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes surrounded by dense gaseous disks. It has been suggested that feedback processes involving jets and/or winds produced by active galactic nuclei can regulate both the growth of the central black hole and its host galaxy. This process could explain why most galaxies do not appear to harbour supermassive black holes whose masses exceed the upper limit set by the relation between black-hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion.",

The observed profiles show that the blue wing is enhanced relative to the red one at all heights above the limb where we can see the flare emission. This effect is more pronounced for higher altitudes. We find that this behavior cannot be explained solely by Doppler shifts due to bulk plasma motions along the LOS. In addition, our modeling shows that the observed profile shapes cannot be reproduced without including nonthermal electron beams as an additional heating source. \n \n Keywords: Solar flare, chromospheric lines, nonthermal electrons, radiative hydrodynamics model, RH code, Mg II k line, line asymmetry. 1 Introduction \n \n During solar flares, intense energy release leads to rapid changes in physical conditions throughout the atmosphere of the Sun. These include temperature increases up to several million degrees Kelvin, strong magnetic fields, high densities, and large velocities. All these factors affect the shape of spectral lines emitted by different atmospheric layers. For example, it has been shown that the intensity ratio between two Fe I lines formed at different temperatures depends on the height of formation of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips 2004) . Also, the presence of nonthermal electrons causes significant deviations from Maxwellian velocity distributions leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al. (1990) ; Doschek et al. (1991) ), while bulk flows lead to Doppler shifts of the line center position (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Brosius 2009 ). Therefore, studying the temporal evolution of the line profiles provides important information about the dynamics of the flaring region. However, interpreting such data requires detailed knowledge of the underlying physics involved in the processes responsible for the observed phenomena. \n \n In particular, the study of the Mg II h&k lines offers unique opportunities to investigate various aspects of solar flares because they form over a wide range",
