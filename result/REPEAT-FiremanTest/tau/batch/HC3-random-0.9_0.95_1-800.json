The wind inside the tires pulls back up against the car , and this allows to keep the car from crashing down too hard into the road . Air is a very good liquid for this because it is able to compress and expand easily . When a wheel rolls over a bump in the road , the area inside the wheel can compress a bit bit to take some of the jolt . This allows to give the ride more comfortable for the individuals inside the car . There are some hard materials that could possible be used to making tires , but they may not work as better as air . For example , a car making of hard tires may be very hard and may not be able to withstand shocks as good as a car filled with air . It would also be significantly heavier , which would give the car use more gasoline to move ."}]}}

I d be glad to assist you understand how to manually determine the subnet mask of a network . First , let s beginning with the basics . A subnet mask is a 32 - bit number that is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks , or subnets . It works by dividing the IP address of a machine into two portions : the network portion and the host portion . The subnet mask decides which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host . Now , let s mean you want to create subnets for a network with the IP address variety 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . To do this , you want to determine how several subnets you want to create and how several hosts you want on each subnet . For example , let s tell you want to create 4 subnets , each with 16 hosts . To determine the subnet mask , you may do the thing : Write down the number of subnets and hosts in binary state . In this case , you want 4 subnets , so you may write 100 in binary . You want 16 hosts , so you may write 10000 in binary . Add the two binary digits together . In this case , the total is 100010000 . Convert the binary number to decimal form . To do this , you may multiply each digit by the corresponding number of 2 and addition the results . In this case , the decimal result of the binary number is 320 . Write down the IP address list in dot - decimal format . In this case , the IP address set is 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . Add the subnet mask to the IP address. To do this , you may mix the subnet mask ( 320 ) with the IP address use dot - decimal terminology . The corresponding IP address would be 192 . 168 . 1 . 320 . This is the fundamental process for calculating the subnet mask of a network . I hope this leads to explain the notion ! Let me know if you have any concerns or want further clarification ."}]}}

Here s how the P2P lending process typically works : Borrowers apply for a loan on the P2P lending platform by submitting information about their creditworthiness , finances , and the intention of the loan . The platform assesses the borrower s creditworthiness and assigns a danger rating to the loan . Lenders browse the available debt on the platform and determine the projects they want to trust in based on the borrower s danger rating and other factors , such as the loan size and interest rate . Once the loan is completely financing , the platform disburses the debt to the borrower and begins collecting accounts on behalf of the lenders . The lenders give yearly calls as the borrower repays the loan , and the P2P lending platform collects a payment for its services . P2P lending can be a convenient and sometimes lucrative way for individuals to lend cash and gain greater profits than they could obtain from traditional accounts , such as debt accounts or government bonds . It can thus be a useful means of financing for borrowers who may not qualify for a loan from a traditional lender . However , it is important for both borrowers and lenders to carefully approach the dangers and possible drawbacks of P2P lending , such as the possible for default or other financial consequences ."}]}}

While suicide accounts can be a good way to set away cash for the future , they do not give the same level of financial protection as life insurance . There are two main forms of life insurance : term life insurance and permanent life insurance . Term life insurance is a type of insurance that provides insurance for a certain time of time , such as 10 , 20 , or 30 years . If you die during the term of the policy , your beneficiaries will get the death insurance . If you outlive the term of the policy , the program will expire and you will not get any gain . Term life insurance is generally less expensive than permanent life insurance , but it does not grow cash value over time . Permanent life insurance is a type of insurance that provides insurance for your full life , as long as you remain to charge the premiums . Permanent life insurance policies addition have a savings component , which allows you to create cash value over time . This cash value can be used to payment premiums or can be withdrawn or lent against . Permanent life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance , but it provides lifelong insurance and the ability to create cash value . I hope this may explain the gap between life insurance and life accounts , as good as the gap between term life insurance and permanent life insurance . Let me know if you have any other concerns ."}]}}

Let s beginning by discussing about what a light year is . A light year is a term of distance that is represented to how long light can go in one year . Light is a type of energy that travels through sky and it is the fastest thing in the world . It can go at a faster of about 300 , 000 kilometers per second , which is pretty quick ! Now, let s talk about galaxies. A galaxy is a huge group of galaxies , particles , and matter that are kept together by gravity . There are billions of galaxies in the world , and each one is really away away from us . In fact , some galaxies are so long away that it takes a long time for their light to touch us . When we turn at a galaxy that is away away , we are actually saw it as it was a long time ago . This is because it takes a long time for the light from that thing to approach us . So , if we saw a Universe that is 30 billion light years away , it means that it took 30 billion years for the light from that light to approach us . But the galaxies is only about 16 billion years long , so how can we view a sky that is 30 billion light years away ? The explanation is that the world is constantly increasing . This means that the area between galaxies is getting big all the time . As the time between galaxies gets big , the gap between them even gets big . This means that even though the sky could not be 30 billion light years away from us now , it was when the light leaving the sky and started heading towards us . I hope that allows to explain things a bit ! Let me know if you have any other concerns ."}]}}
