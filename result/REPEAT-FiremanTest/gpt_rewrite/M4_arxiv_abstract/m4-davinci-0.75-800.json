The statistical properties of the eigenvalues of complex quantum systems have been a topic of study in recent years (see, for example, reference 1). It has been shown that certain universal features of these spectra can be understood within the framework of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) 2. RMT deals with the statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of families of random matrices. One of the most studied models in RMT is the Wigner ensemble 3, which considers N × N Hermitian matrices H = H† with independent and identically distributed entries hij that have a mean of zero and a variance of 1/N. For instance, if the probability density function of each entry hij decays appropriately as |hij| → ∞, it follows from standard arguments 4 that the empirical measure µN of the normalized eigenvalues of H converges weakly to some deterministic measure µ on the unit circle T = { z ∈ C : |z| = 1 }, referred to as the limiting measure. Moreover, under certain conditions regarding the decay rate of the entries (see reference 1), the Stieltjes transform mN(z) := E[Tr(H - zI)^{-1}] of µN converges pointwise to the Stieltjes transform M(z) of µ 5. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to investigating the behavior of the spectrum near its edge 6-8. Notably, it has been shown 9 that the fluctuation statistics of the largest eigenvalues λmax exhibit specific characteristics.",

Recently, researchers have investigated the effects of modified Coulomb interactions between two oppositely charged particles in a magnetic field perpendicular to their plane. They discovered that the ground state energy is highly dependent on whether the total angular momentum J = L + S is zero, where L is the orbital angular momentum and S is the spin angular momentum. For instance, if J = 0, the ground state energy is given by E0 = −e²/lB + O(1/N), where lB = eB/mc is the magnetic length. Conversely, if J = 1/2, the ground state energy takes on a different form.",

INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nThe measurement of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium (Υ) production is one of the most promising probes to investigate properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions  1  . It has been suggested that the interaction between the produced quarkonia and the surrounding medium may lead to their partial melting  2  , i.e., to a decrease of the bound state masses due to color screening  3  .\nIn this work we present results obtained within an effective field theory framework  4  , where the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons rather than individual hadronic states.

Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors.

They have been observed in pairs or in close proximity, indicating that SMBHs undergo merger events. During these mergers, SMBHs lose angular momentum due to gravitational wave emission. Consequently, they will eventually coalesce into a single object. The final stage of the merger involves two black holes orbiting each other. Due to the strong gravitational fields present, the Kerr metric must be employed in the framework of general relativity. However, since the orbits of merging black holes can be highly eccentric, higher-order corrections to the Kerr solution become necessary. These corrections encompass both post-Newtonian terms and those arising from quantum effects. It has been demonstrated that incorporating these corrections leads to precession of the orbital plane. For instance, if the spin axes of the two black holes are aligned but point in opposite directions, the orbital plane will precess around the total angular momentum vector.

Our findings indicate that for large system sizes, there is no requirement for a transition at all; instead, we observed a distinct separation between two different dynamical regimes as a function of temperature (T). In the low-temperature regime (T < Tc), the dynamics are primarily influenced by fluctuations, leading to a scenario reminiscent of equilibrium states. Conversely, in the high-temperature regime (T > Tc), the dynamics become significantly faster as the system quickly relaxes into metastable states. The crossover temperature (Tc) is found to depend logarithmically on the number of particles (N) present in the system. These results align with the emerging concept of active matter, which consists of self-propelling units such as living cells or modified microswimmers.

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers  1  . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity  2  . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory  3  , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc  4  .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value  5  . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane  6  . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system  7, 8  . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3  9  or LaAlO3  10  onto the surface of cuprate superconductors.

The combination of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), both of which are high-mobility materials for high-temperature superconductivity, has been found to be p-type conducting despite the significant lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This indicates that charge transfer occurs across the interface due to enhanced hybridization rather than strain effects. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer deposited on top. These findings suggest a novel approach to modulating carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has only been achieved in modified copper-oxide systems, particularly those with CuO2 layers. In these materials, hole doping in the CuO2 plane leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are essential for superfluidity. However, the highest critical temperature (Tc) recorded in this class of materials is 92 K, which remains below the theoretical limit predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. There is ongoing interest in strategies to further increase Tc. One promising avenue involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane. For instance, substituting certain elements in the CuO2 plane with fluorine can reduce the number of holes in the system. Alternatively, one might directly inject electrons into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides, such as SrTiO3 or LaAlO3, on the surface of cuprate superconductors. While these methods show potential, they require precise control over film thickness and quality during deposition.

Since then, various theoretical models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including the so-called two-fluid model. According to this model, there are two distinct types of charge carriers in these materials, namely holes and electrons. These charge carriers interact via attractive Coulomb forces and form Cooper pairs. When the material undergoes a phase transition below its critical temperature (Tc), the Cooper pairs condense into a superfluid state, leading to macroscopic quantum effects such as zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect. However, it soon became clear that the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory could not fully explain all experimental observations. For instance, BCS theory predicts that the energy gap between the ground state and excited states should close rapidly as the temperature approaches absolute zero. In contrast, experimental results indicate that the energy gap remains significant even at very low temperatures. To address this discrepancy, various extensions of the BCS theory have been developed. Among these, the Eliashberg formalism is particularly noteworthy, as it emphasizes the role of electron-phonon interactions.",

Recent research has focused on designing various classes of STBCs to improve efficiency while ensuring robust error performance in challenging transmission environments, such as multipath propagation and frequency-selective fading. However, many existing designs prioritize error performance without adequately addressing the complexity of implementation. This has led us to develop a new class of STBCs that can be implemented with reduced receiver complexity. Recent studies have shown that certain mathematical structures, such as Galois fields, finite rings, and quaternions, can be represented using the framework of Clifford algebras. These representations enable the design of advanced modulation techniques and communication systems.

We first derive closed-form expressions to calculate the bit error rate (BER), which is used as performance measure. Then, by using these results, we analyze how the BER changes according to various system parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of pulses per symbol, and timing jitter variance. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our analysis. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as:  1 . Derivation of closed-form expression for calculating the BER.  2 . Analysis on the effect of timing jitter on IR-UWB systems.  3 . Numerical verification of analytical results. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing high data-rate wireless communication systems that operate over unlicensed bands  1  , especially those based on impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB:  2  ). Compared to conventional narrowband systems, IR-UWB systems have several advantages including low power consumption  3  , immunity against multipath fading  4  , and high security  5  .\nHowever, one major drawback of IR-UWB systems is their vulnerability to timing jitter  6  -  8  . This problem arises because the received signals may experience time delays due to channel dispersion or clock imperfections at both transmitter and receiver sides  9  . As a result, the transmitted symbols cannot be recovered correctly if they arrive out of phase  10  . Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of timing jitter on the performance of IR-UWB systems  11  .\nTo address this issue, many studies have investigated the impact of timing jitter on various aspects of IR-UWB systems  12 -  16  .

Compared to narrowband systems, IR-UWB systems offer several advantages, including better coexistence with other systems, immunity to multipath interference, and enhanced security. However, a significant drawback of IR-UWB systems is their susceptibility to timing jitter. This issue arises because the transmitted signals can experience time delays due to dispersion or clock inaccuracies at both the transmitter and receiver. Consequently, if the transmitted symbols arrive out of sync, they cannot be accurately recovered. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effects of timing jitter on the performance of IR-UWB systems. \n\nTo address this issue, several studies have investigated the impact of timing jitter on the performance of IR-UWB systems. For instance, one study analyzed how timing jitter affects the efficiency of IR-UWB systems, demonstrating a decrease in efficiency as jitter increases. Another study examined the relationship between timing jitter and bit error probability (BEP). However, most of the existing research has only scratched the surface of this complex issue.",

These findings suggest that protoplanetary disks can form planets similar to those in our own solar system. \n\nKeywords: Circumstellar matter, Herbig Ae/Be stars, Massive stars, Planet formation, Protostars, Stellar evolution, Millimeter and submillimeter observations, Nearby stars, Radio astronomy, High-energy astrophysics.",

The key findings are as follows: \n\n- In both galaxies, we found that molecular gas is concentrated in the regions influenced by the bar, while atomic gas closely follows the distribution of stars. \n- The rate of star formation varies significantly in areas where the density of molecular gas changes, indicating that the torques exerted by the bar can drive the collapse of gas clouds into regions of increased star formation. \n- The infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shows a clear correlation with the locations of recent star formation activity. \n- A comparison of our data with hydrodynamical simulations suggests that the surrounding regions of the interstellar medium are affected by the bar's gravitational influence, which drives substantial amounts of gas toward the inner Lindblad resonance.",

Researchers have investigated the impact of vaccination programs, quarantine measures, and other interventions on the spread of epidemics. Additionally, various studies have focused on the influence of different factors on pathogen propagation. Most existing research employs deterministic models; however, stochastic models and agent-based models also provide insights. Agent-based models allow for the consideration of diverse individual behaviors, while stochastic models offer more realistic representations of random events. In this study, we develop mathematical models to analyze the dynamics of infectious diseases in a population.

It has been observed that the universe is expanding at a rate greater than expected if it were solely influenced by normal matter, indicating the presence of an additional component known as dark energy, which is responsible for this accelerated expansion. However, the nature of dark energy remains largely unknown, and numerous models have been proposed to explain its origin. In this paper, we will examine a specific model of dark energy based on extra dimensions. According to this model, our four-dimensional world exists on a three-dimensional brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk. If dark energy propagates into the bulk, it could influence the dynamics on the 3-brane. For instance, if a dark energy field exists in the bulk but outside the 3-brane, its effects could still be felt in our universe, even if it does not interact with us directly. Thus, the presence of extra dimensions may lead to dark energy effects that extend beyond those predicted by general relativity.",

They have been extensively studied both theoretically and observationally over the years. One significant aspect of their physics involves the behavior of objects as they approach these black holes, particularly those that manage to escape from their gravitational pull. Recent studies have highlighted some fascinating physical phenomena occurring very close to the event horizon. For instance, when considering a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, its trajectory is altered due to the so-called photon sphere. If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, it can emit photons before ultimately falling into the black hole. Another interesting scenario arises when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole, where its path is similarly affected by the dynamics of the photon sphere. However, unlike the case of a Reissner-Nordström black hole, the environment now includes not only photons but also gravitons. Much effort has been devoted to studying the dynamics of fields outside these black holes.

However, these measurements can be challenging because they heavily rely on the assumptions made about the luminosity of the stellar population. For instance, if we underestimate the luminosity, the calculated distance will be too short. Conversely, if we overestimate the luminosity, the derived distance will be too long. Therefore, it is essential to refine the luminosity model before determining the distance to any galaxy. One effective approach to address this issue is to utilize radio sources whose distances can be independently verified through other methods. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources located in star-forming regions. Among these, maser sources have been particularly valuable due to their ability to provide very precise distance estimates. Maser emissions are typically associated with star-forming regions where water vapor molecules condense into microscopic ice grains. When these grains grow larger than about one micron, they become effective emitters and begin to produce coherent radio emissions. The emission line widths of masers are extremely narrow, making them distinct from those of typical radio sources.",

It occurs when different thermodynamic states exist in equilibrium or when metastable states are present. A classic example is the coexistence of ice and liquid water below 0 °C. There have been numerous studies focused on understanding how interfaces separating different phases evolve under various influences, such as thermal fluctuations, magnetic fields, and mechanical stress.

        "rewrite_text": "We explore the reasons why quantum mechanics is considered nonlocal, emphasizing its ability to predict the likelihood of a measurement being made in various scenarios. We demonstrate how this can result in superluminal connections between two parties sharing entangled states, utilizing only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Additionally, we extend the Born rule to accommodate arbitrary components of von Neumann measurements. The standard formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are conducted under ideal conditions, where no information is exchanged during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in reality, experimental imperfections such as decoherence from environmental noise, imprecision in measurements, and inaccuracies in setups always exist. To address these issues, various approaches have been proposed, including stochastic Schrödinger equations, interest systems, and generalized probabilistic frameworks. In this context, we consider another perspective known as Quantum Bayesianism. In Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function represents our knowledge about the system rather than its physical state. This implies that when a measurement is made, the outcome is determined by updating our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem. For instance, if Alice performs a measurement on her system along the x-axis, she updates her knowledge based on the observed value. If Bob conducts a similar measurement but obtains a different result, he must perform a new measurement since his knowledge has changed.",

Introduction\n\nSemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This process provides insights into the quark structure of the target nucleus through the analysis of final state particles produced alongside the scattered lepton. At high Bjorken x values, where the struck quarks are nearly on-shell, SIDIS probes the transition region between the non-perturbative regime governed by soft interactions and the perturbative domain dominated by short-distance processes. In this kinematic regime, it becomes possible to investigate the properties of bound states through their interactions with hard photons, thereby shedding light on the dynamics of composite systems. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that the cross section for SIDIS is highly sensitive to the transverse momentum (k_T) of the outgoing hadrons. It has been shown that the dependence of the cross section on k_T can help differentiate between various theoretical models.

One potential solution to this issue could be the existence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are systems featuring a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. If the gas density in the disk is sufficiently high, the gravitational field of the black hole can draw in the infalling matter, leading to significant angular momentum transfer through viscous stresses.

We demonstrate how to utilize this representation to identify regions within the system using only the component information related to each node. This method allows us to find optimal configurations of the system in low-temperature environments (where thermal fluctuations are minimal) without the need to explore the entire configuration space. This approach is particularly beneficial for systems where traditional methods would face computational challenges. Our findings indicate that the proposed method yields accurate predictions, especially when applied to systems with a limited number of components. Additionally, we explore potential extensions of these ideas that could lead to further enhancements in computational efficiency.\n\nIntroduction: Many physical phenomena, such as magnetism and phase transitions, arise from cooperative behaviors among particles. For instance, magnetic ordering in solids occurs due to strong interactions between their magnetic moments. Similarly, liquid helium exhibits superfluidity below its critical temperature of 2.17 K, a result of tightly bound helium-4 bosons behaving like Cooper pairs. These examples highlight the necessity of studying collective behavior through large ensembles rather than isolated systems. However, simulating the macroscopic behavior of complex systems composed of numerous interacting particles presents one of the most significant challenges in computational science today. While the microscopic interactions can be described by quantum mechanics, the macroscopic behavior of large collections often requires approximations that fail to capture the intricate correlations between different parts of the system. Consequently, numerical simulations of large-scale models of complex systems often rely on methods like Monte Carlo simulations. Unfortunately, these approaches become computationally intensive when applied to systems with millions of components.",

We demonstrate that SPs exist only when the effective dielectric constant is negative, while SPhPs arise when it is positive. Additionally, we compare our results with those obtained from the two-fluid Drude model and discuss their respective limitations. Surface plasmons, which are collective oscillations of conduction electrons at metal-dielectric interfaces, have been extensively studied over the years. They play a crucial role in various fields such as optics, sensing, energy harvesting, and catalysis. Recently, there has been increasing interest in surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs), which are excitations associated with acoustic phonons.

This phenomenon arises because these materials undergo a phase transition into a state where charge carriers form bosonic quasiparticles known as Cooper pairs. However, it has only been recently that the microscopic origins of this pairing mechanism have become clearer, particularly with the recognition of the importance of d-wave symmetry in these systems. It has been established that a key factor contributing to this behavior is the presence of strongly correlated states on the Fermi surface, which interact with collective excitations called phonons. Consequently, understanding the role of phonons in various lattice structures provides valuable insights into the interactions among charge carriers. Recently, there has been increased interest in studying the influence of phonons on the physical properties of different classes of materials. For instance, one of the primary models used to describe cuprates is based on a two-dimensional square lattice. Conversely, another class of materials, known as iron-based pnictides, also displays similar phenomena but is characterized by more complex three-dimensional structures.

One of the key issues in this context is the behavior of ground state configurations in relation to their geometric structures. A notable example arises when considering a random walk on a torus \\( T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1 \\), or more generally, on any orientable two-dimensional surface \\( M_g \\) with genus \\( g > 0 \\). Recent work has shown that in this setting, it is possible to define a consistent set of physical observables associated with the operator values \\( O(x) \\), where \\( x \\in M_g \\). Furthermore, it follows from previous arguments that all correlation functions of these operators can be expressed as products of two-point correlators: \\( \\langle O_i(x) O_j(y) \\rangle = C_{ij} \\delta(x - y) \\). Here, \\( C_{ij} \\) is a function that depends solely on the positions \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within the surface. For example, if we consider \\( g \\) to be a sphere, then \\( C_{ij} \\) will depend only on the geodesic distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).",

Introduction\n\nPolymer modifications have been extensively utilized as coatings on solid surfaces or as additives in various industrial applications, including textiles, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food products. A common method for producing these modified polymers involves polymerizing monomers within small droplets suspended in water, known as emulsions. This process can be initiated either chemically or physically, depending on whether the droplet components contain the necessary species to trigger the polymerization reactions. For instance, if the droplets do not contain any initiators, they must first be processed separately before being combined with the main mixture of other ingredients. Once this separation is complete, the droplets will begin to polymerize until their size becomes comparable to the wavelength of light passing through them. At this point, the droplets become optically opaque, and growth continues unabated, leading to the formation of large micelles. These micelles can then be separated from the solution using centrifugation or filtration techniques. Alternatively, a different type of emulsifier can be used to ensure that the droplets remain stable throughout the entire process.

Our findings indicate that dynamic components exacerbate the challenges posed by these failures. Specifically, we observe that increasing the number of attackers or the rate of component failures can significantly influence the likelihood of a global cascade. This suggests that it is crucial to consider both static and dynamic elements when assessing the resilience of complex systems against cascading failures. The interdependence among various components in complex systems is vital for understanding phenomena such as epidemic outbreaks, traffic jams, financial crises, and power outages. The 2008 grid failure, which resulted from an unprecedented series of cascading failures, underscored the importance of recognizing interdependence among system components. In our study, we focus on interdependent networks characterized by two types of nodes: source (S) and target (T). Source nodes provide resources to other nodes, while target nodes rely on these resources. For instance, in the electrical grid, generators supply power to substations; if one generator fails, the connected substations will also lose power. Similarly, in social networks, individuals depend on each other's opinions; if someone loses their job or becomes isolated, it can negatively impact the social network's overall health. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of interdependency in determining the resilience of interconnected systems. However, most existing research has concentrated on static properties, assuming that all connections remain stable over time. This assumption is often inaccurate, as interactions can evolve and components can change. Therefore, it is essential to account for the dynamics of these interactions.",

Additionally, we provide an algorithm that solves this problem in O(n^3) time. Our findings are based on reductions from the Exact Cover by 3-Sets (X3C) problem, which asks whether there exists a collection of subsets of a set S such that each element of S is covered by exactly three of these subsets; this problem has been established as NP-complete.

Correlation clustering is one of the many problems studied in the field of clustering, which also includes k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and graph partitioning. It was independently introduced by Bansal et al., Blum et al., and Dasgupta et al. Specifically, given an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V represents the vertices and E represents the edges, we say that two vertices u and v in V are adjacent if they share an edge in E. A cluster C ⊆ V is defined as a subset of vertices such that the pairwise distances between its members are all less than or equal to a certain threshold t > 0. More formally, let d be a distance function defined as d: V × V → R+, where dist(u, v) denotes the shortest path between u and v; then, C is considered a cohesive cluster if and only if for all pairs of vertices u, v ∈ C, it holds that dist(u, v) ≤ t.",

Ultimately, we demonstrate how these findings can be applied to accurately measure the s-wave scattering lengths between different atomic species. Our research opens up new possibilities for investigating quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity and supersolidity, in systems of ultracold fermions. We present experimental data obtained during our studies of ultracold cesium (Cs) trapped within a slower trap. By employing magnetic field-controlled Feshbach resonances, we generate weakly bound Cs2 dimer molecules from a fermionic gas. By measuring the binding energies of these molecules as a function of magnetic field strength and atomic density, we derive precise values for the scattering lengths between two Cs atoms. Furthermore, we observe that the molecule formation rate is significantly enhanced when the trapping lasers are tuned close to one of the atomic resonances. This enhancement can be understood by considering the requirements for stimulated emission, which are essential for facilitating the formation of bound molecular states.",

        "rewrite_text": "We conducted deep radio observations at 1.4 GHz using the VLA to study two TeV gamma-ray emitting regions. One region is associated with the modified cluster Cyg OB2 #8 (HESS J1640-465), while the other is located near the modified WR 25 (HESS J1641-463). The high-quality data reveal significant radio emission around both TeV sources, which has not been addressed in previous surveys. We explore potential scenarios for this emission, drawing on our findings and those proposed by other researchers. We suggest that the observed structures are due to synchrotron emission produced by relativistic particles accelerated in shocks generated by stellar winds in these regions. This scenario also accounts for the absence of X-ray counterparts, despite targeted observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Finally, we estimate the magnetic field strength necessary to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding binary systems. \n\nThe Cygnus OB2 association comprises over 100 OB stars distributed across an area of approximately 50 square degrees, centered at l = 80° and b = 1° (Fig. 1a). It has been suggested that many of these stars may belong to binary systems or multiple star systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010). These systems can generate powerful stellar winds that create shock fronts in their surroundings, where particles can be accelerated to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shock region, they can interact with photons from the surrounding interstellar medium, resulting in the production of detectable electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, including the TeV regime. Several studies indicate that the known TeV sources in the region may be linked to dense stellar associations like Cyg OB2 (e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a, b, 2007a). However, only a few of these associations have been confirmed through multi-wavelength observations, including infrared imaging, spectroscopy, and radio continuum studies (e.g., Reimer & Böttcher 2006, Castro-Tirado et al.).",

The authors identified two distinct methods for achieving this: one involves a three-form H-flux, while the other introduces a modified five-form F-flux.

The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process.

Introduction\n\nIn this study, we report photometric data for one of the most extensively researched Galactic globular clusters: NGC 5466. Discovered by William Herschel during his renowned survey of the Milky Way, its distance has been estimated using various methods, yielding values ranging from approximately 8 kpc to 12 kpc. These estimates are consistent with one another but differ from those derived from the analysis of its red giant branch, which suggests a greater distance of about 16 kpc. The first detailed examination of the cluster was conducted by Trumpler, who determined it to have a core radius of 3 arcminutes and an age of approximately 4 billion years. These findings were later confirmed by other researchers. More recently, structural parameters of the cluster were assessed, revealing a core radius of 5.3 arcminutes and a mass segregation among the brightest stars. NGC 5466 exhibits a bimodal color distribution and a profile consistent with a King model, suggesting the presence of both old and intermediate-age stars within the cluster. Indeed, spectroscopic studies have further supported these observations.",

A significant challenge in these proposals is protecting qubits from environmental noise. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that interactions between different modes of a system can lead to phenomena such as dephasing and dissipation. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when considering large networks of interacting qubits. In this work, we examine a simplified model consisting of two weakly coupled SQUIDs immersed in a phonon environment.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nMacroscopic tunneling refers to the phenomenon where a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom coherently transition across potential barriers, leading to novel physical phenomena such as superfluidity, Josephson junctions, and Bose-Einstein condensation. This phenomenon has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. In this paper, we present results related to the classical aspects of macroscopic quantum tunneling. Specifically, we investigate a system composed of N identical particles arranged in a one-dimensional lattice subjected to a magnetic field. Each particle interacts with its two nearest neighbors through repulsive potentials while experiencing attractive interactions from all other particles in the system. This model was initially proposed by Calogero, who demonstrated that the ground state of equally spaced particles forms a Wigner crystal. It has been shown that the presence of a weak periodic driving force can affect the translational symmetry of the system, leading to the emergence of collective excitations. These excitations exhibit characteristics similar to those observed in macroscopic quantum tunneling. For instance, when the amplitude of the external drive exceeds a certain threshold...",

The active region NOAA 10930, located at S19E09, produced two flares classified as GOES M5.7 and M1.0. Our analysis revealed significant changes in the photospheric magnetic fields before and after these flares. Notably, we observed a flux emergence event that occurred approximately one hour prior to the first flare. This newly emerged magnetic field was situated beneath a coronal hole that overlapped the active region. Following the flares, the polarity inversion line shifted towards the center of the active region, where the strongest magnetic gradients were detected. During this time, we also noted a rapid increase in the intensity of Fe XXI emission near the footpoints of the loops connecting opposite polarities. These observations indicate that the magnetic changes induced by the flares likely resulted in heating of the loop-top regions and the evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona along the reconnected loops.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe phenomenon of luminescence has garnered significant attention globally due to its potential to provide valuable insights into the properties and behaviors of solids. Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly useful as it enables us to analyze the distribution of states excited within the conduction band. Numerous efforts have been made to develop theoretical models for luminescence phenomena, including TSL. However, most of these models have assumed that the system remains close to equilibrium during the process. This assumption has led to discrepancies with important experimental observations. For instance, the shape of the TSL curve is highly dependent on the material type; in insulators, it typically shows a distinct peak, while in semiconductors, it can exhibit a more complex profile. Furthermore, within the same category of materials, such as semiconductor crystals, the characteristics can vary significantly based on the doping level.

        "rewrite_text": "We demonstrate that the observed value of the cosmological constant is systematically influenced by the surrounding matter. We reject this notion for various models of cosmic structures. Our analysis indicates that the value can vary by as much as 30% if we assume that the average density of matter aligns with the current density. The value decreases when the matter density is lower than the current density or when a more negative value is assumed. This systematic error may account for the inconsistencies observed among different measurements of the cosmological constant. Additionally, it could impact experiments aimed at accurately measuring the effects of the cosmological constant. \n\nThe expansion of our universe, characterized by different models of cosmic structures, naturally leads to questions about its nature. One possibility is that the observed variations are simply due to vacuum energy. Another hypothesis is that these variations arise from the presence of exotic particles, such as axions. To explore these ideas observationally, precise measurements of the expansion rate of the universe are essential. However, there are significant challenges associated with this task. For instance, while the observed acceleration of the universe is minimal, the Hubble constant (H₀ = 100h km/s/Mpc) suggests a value of approximately 0.7 with an uncertainty of 0.1. The variations in the cosmic structure over time complicate the interpretation of distance-redshift relationships. Furthermore, since the cosmological constant varies with both time and density, it alters the rate of cosmic expansion and introduces uncertainties in distance measurements. Lastly, the evolution of the cosmological constant over time adds to the complexity of the problem. \n\nOne approach to address these challenges is to directly measure the equation of state of dark energy, denoted as w(z), where ρ and ρ₀ represent the energy density and the critical density, respectively. If dark energy behaves like a perfect fluid, then w(z) would equal -1. It has been suggested that the most effective methods for measuring these parameters could significantly enhance our understanding of the universe's expansion.",

Introduction** There has been a growing body of literature suggesting that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may originate from progenitors surrounded by stellar winds or envelopes (e.g., Woosley & Bloom 2006). If this hypothesis holds true, it implies that the dynamics of the explosion and the behavior of the resulting emissions could be significantly altered by these environments. For instance, Chevalier et al. (2004) proposed that if the surrounding medium follows an r^-2 power law, the resulting light curve would display a plateau followed by a steep decline. This behavior has been confirmed through observational studies (e.g., Panaitescu 2005; Kumar & Panaitescu 2008), supporting the scenario that some GRBs originate from such progenitors (e.g., Zhang 2007). However, other researchers have challenged this scenario on theoretical grounds (e.g., Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2005) and through observational evidence (e.g., Lazzati et al. 2009). It is important to note that while the majority of GRBs appear to follow this trend, there are instances where no clear evidence of interaction with a surrounding medium is observed.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most intriguing topics in modern physics. Its existence has been inferred primarily through its gravitational effects on visible matter, as well as through various experimental observations. Despite numerous theoretical models proposed to explain DM, none have been experimentally validated thus far. One possibility is that DM consists of exotic elementary particles. If these particles interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter, they could escape detection if produced in large quantities. Conversely, if they interact strongly with normal matter, they could be directly detectable. Several experiments have been conducted to search for DM, with varying degrees of success. Recently, results from the DAMA experiment have garnered significant attention due to their indication of annual modulation in detected signals, which correlates with the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This modulation suggests an increase in the rate of detected recoils during certain months, a phenomenon that cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model of particle interactions. Various authors have proposed different interpretations of these findings.",

Introduction\nAutomatic analysis of musical scores has been a significant challenge in music science over the past few decades. It involves recovering the harmonic structure of a piece of music from its audio or MIDI file. This task can be divided into two main subtasks: detecting note onset and estimating the pitch of the notes played. Note onset detection is typically achieved through heuristic methods applied to the raw audio data. Once the note onset times are established, the next step is to estimate the pitches corresponding to these events. Various approaches exist for tackling this problem, ranging from simple methods to more sophisticated statistical models. In this study, we focus on the estimation of pitch, also known as pitch tracking. Pitch tracking involves assigning a pitch value to each detected note to create a sequence of pitch values that corresponds to the original audio. A common method for representing pitch information is through pitch class profiles (PCPs), where each profile indicates the number of occurrences of a specific pitch within a defined time window. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a PCP derived from a single-note melody.",

Our proposed method is illustrated using two case studies: one in which there was no unobserved confounding but some historical data was missing; and another where both historical data and unmeasured confounders influenced the estimates. The first case shows that our method produces estimates similar to those obtained under complete data conditions when all relevant information is available. In contrast, the second case highlights situations where standard approaches can yield biased results due to missing historical data or unmeasured confounding. Finally, we provide evidence that our proposed method remains valid even if the model assumptions are not fully satisfied. Keywords: Marginal Structural Models, Longitudinal Data Analysis.",

Introduction\nStellar ages are crucial in various fields of astrophysics, ranging from studies of the Galaxy to exoplanet research. Accurate age determinations are essential for understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, obtaining precise ages for stars can be challenging due to the complexities involved in their brightness and luminosity, as well as the intricate variations in their properties. For instance, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be estimated using photometric techniques such as theoretical isochrones and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods become less effective for stars in advanced evolutionary stages where convection plays a significant role. Additionally, although asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the internal structure of evolved stars, the interpretation of such data requires detailed modeling of each star individually. Consequently, alternative methods must be explored to derive ages for large samples of stars across different evolutionary stages. Gyrochronology offers a promising avenue for estimating stellar ages based on the rotation rate and magnetic activity, which is influenced by dynamo processes occurring in the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003). It has been demonstrated that the Rossby number (Ro), defined as the ratio of the rotation period (P) to the convective turnover timescale, plays a significant role in this context.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, there has been growing interest in studying the properties of hadronic states due to both theoretical advancements and experimental discoveries. On the theoretical side, lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) provides valuable insights into the nonperturbative aspects of strong interactions. However, most calculations to date have primarily focused on ground-state hadrons. In contrast, experimental observations of excited states that deviate from the predictions of the quark model have prompted further investigation into their underlying structures. For instance, newly identified scalar mesons in the range of 1.4 to 1.7 GeV offer intriguing information about their nature. It is important to note that some of these recently discovered resonances do not fit neatly into the conventional quark-antiquark framework. Therefore, it is essential to analyze them more thoroughly. In this study, we will employ QCD sum rules to systematically investigate the properties, masses, and couplings of scalar mesons below 2 GeV, with a particular focus on the f0(1370) and its significance.",

This source has previously been identified as a radio and near-infrared continuum source, but it had not been observed in the infrared spectrum until now. It exhibits prominent PAH emission and weak fine-structure line emission. Furthermore, we identified several other sources in the field, including two bright starburst regions located approximately 10 arcminutes from M87. These findings demonstrate that the MIR characteristics of galactic emissions can be effectively studied even in densely populated regions, such as those found near the centers of rich clusters like Virgo.",

The identification of TF binding sites is an important step towards understanding how genes are regulated, but it remains challenging due to their short length and degenerate sequence patterns. In this work we present a novel computational method for predicting TF binding sites based on a random walk model on a one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) lattice representing the DNA molecule. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to several datasets containing experimentally validated binding sites. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as part of a pipeline for identifying putative binding sites in large genomic regions. Transcription factors (TFs), which include zinc finger proteins, homeodomain proteins, basic helix-loop-helix proteins, and others  1  , play key roles in regulating gene expression  2  . They bind specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes  3  and recruit other regulatory molecules such as coactivators  4  or corepressors  5  , or they may directly affect the rate at which RNA polymerases synthesize messenger RNAs  6  .\nThe identification of TF binding sites has been shown to be useful for studying gene regulation  7, 8  . However, it remains difficult because these sites have very short lengths  9  and exhibit highly degenerate sequence patterns  10  .

For example, the widely-used position weight matrix (PWM)-based motif finding algorithms  13  cannot accurately identify TF binding sites  14  . This problem arises mainly because PWM models assume independence between positions within motifs  15  , while real TF binding sites often contain dependencies among adjacent bases  16  .

Understanding the diversity of TF binding sites is crucial for comprehending gene regulation; however, this task is challenging due to the short and degenerate nature of these sequences. In this study, we introduce a novel computational method for predicting TF binding sites based on a random walk model applied to a one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) lattice representation of the DNA molecule. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods when tested on datasets containing experimentally validated binding sites. This suggests that our method could serve as a valuable tool for identifying potential binding sites across large genomic regions. Transcription factors, including zinc finger proteins, homeodomain proteins, helix-loop-helix proteins, and others, play essential roles in regulating gene expression. They bind to specific regions of target genes and interact with other regulatory molecules, such as coactivators and corepressors, or directly affect the rate of RNA synthesis by RNA polymerases. Identifying TF binding sites is important for studying gene regulation; however, the short lengths and degenerate nature of these sites complicate this process. Various methods have been developed to predict TF binding sites, but many existing approaches suffer from high rates of false positives. For instance, the commonly used position weight matrix (PWM) motif-finding algorithms often fail to accurately predict TF binding sites. This issue arises because PWM models assume independence between positions within motifs, while TF binding sites often exhibit dependencies among adjacent positions. To tackle this challenge, some researchers have attempted to incorporate higher-order interactions into PWMs, while others have focused on developing probabilistic models, including Markov models and neural networks.",

We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to derive solutions for black holes with different topologies. Initially, we focus on rotating solutions with toroidal horizons.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS \n\nThe search for genuine solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of general relativity. However, finding such solutions can be quite challenging, as it often involves solving complex nonlinear partial differential equations. This difficulty increases when considering modified theories that include additional fields or matter. Nonetheless, there are established techniques that guide researchers in identifying classes of solutions starting from simpler cases. One of the key methods involves transforming the Shelby solution into another form using nonholonomic modifications. Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while maintaining the integrity of the solutions. For instance, if the transformed solution satisfies the Einstein equations, then the original solution does as well. In this context, we apply nonholonomic transformations to derive solutions to the Einstein equations in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, specifically those that admit at least two independent commuting fields with their orbits being closed curves. Stationary axisymmetric spacetimes are significant in astrophysics, as they describe the intricate dynamics of rotating bodies such as stars and planets.",

Achieving quantum degeneracy in fermions, specifically cooling them below 1 microkelvin, remains one of the most challenging problems in atomic physics today. This challenge intensifies when the fermion density is high, as increased collisions can hinder the cooling process. Recent advancements in experimental techniques have enabled us to trap and manipulate ultracold atoms with unprecedented precision, allowing us to explore various phenomena such as superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation in ultracold atomic gases. A key objective in these experiments is to reach quantum degenerate regimes where the gas consists of strongly interacting fermions. However, achieving such low temperatures necessitates effective cooling strategies. One promising approach to attain this goal is through the formation of paired states. Pairs of fermions can form bound states, known as Cooper pairs, similar to those in superconductors. Likewise, fermions in ultracold atomic clouds can also form bound states. If the interaction strength between fermions is sufficiently large, they will tend to pair up rather than remain unpaired.

These experiments typically involve trapping neutral atoms in a standing wave pattern generated by two counter-propagating laser fields that are closely tuned to create a deep periodic lattice. The resulting atomic gas forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where all atoms occupy the same quantum state. Such systems have garnered considerable interest as they allow for the exploration of fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics while also serving as a platform for studying novel phenomena. For instance, these systems have been utilized to investigate superfluidity, Josephson effects, Bloch oscillations, Landau-Zener tunneling, and Anderson localization. However, despite extensive theoretical work, the range of behaviors exhibited by these systems remains poorly understood. One reason for the unpredictability of these systems is their time-dependent nature. Since the laser fields are often off-resonant, the amplitude of the potential varies periodically over timescales comparable to the experimental parameters. Consequently, the effective spectrum of the system becomes quasi-periodic, complicating the task of solving the Schrödinger equation.",

Most research has focused on quantum systems characterized by Hamiltonians with short-range interactions, but recent studies have begun to explore more complex quantum systems. It has been demonstrated that when the initial state is excited, the system will relax into thermal equilibrium after a global quench. However, this scenario may not hold generically in all quantum systems, particularly when the system is coupled to an external reservoir. Instead, equilibration may only occur under specific conditions, such as when the initial state is close to the ground state of the new Hamiltonian or when the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian includes a sufficiently large number of excitations.",

We demonstrate how GAs can be employed to evolve optimal behaviors for agents within a simulated environment, where each agent possesses unique capabilities. Our findings indicate that this method enhances the overall efficiency of the system while minimizing the volume of communication between agents. This research was supported by the EPSRC under grant EP/G066058/1. \n\nThe application of agent-based systems is growing in various fields that require autonomous decision-making and learning, such as intelligent transportation, smart grids, healthcare, manufacturing, robotics, and military operations. However, several challenges arise in developing these systems. One major issue is scalability, particularly as the number of agents increases. For instance, if agents need to make independent decisions, it becomes impractical to create individualized behavioral models for each one. Instead, they must depend on some form of collective intelligence, which necessitates efficient communication. Excessive information exchange can overwhelm the system, leading to degraded performance. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize data transmission among agents while still ensuring effective performance. To tackle these challenges, researchers have proposed various techniques ranging from simple heuristics to advanced machine learning methods. These approaches can be categorized into centralized and decentralized mechanisms. Centralized systems manage the entire operation from a single point, while decentralized systems allow agents to operate independently.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nUnderstanding how macroscopic systems behave under the influence of their environments has been a significant focus in the field since its inception. This issue becomes particularly complex when addressing intricate many-body systems, such as those found in condensed matter physics or biological contexts, where the number of degrees of freedom can be exceedingly large. A theoretical approach to tackle these challenges involves studying the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the system of interest, conditioned on specific measurement outcomes over the relevant degrees of freedom. Recent efforts have aimed to develop methods to analyze the dynamics of the reduced density matrices. Among these, the Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) presents a promising alternative to other methodologies due to its ability to incorporate non-Markovian effects. However, despite its capacity to yield accurate predictions for short-time evolutions, the HDM struggles to correctly capture the asymptotic behavior of the system.

Introduction\n\nSocial networks are playing an increasingly vital role in people's lives, providing diverse ways for individuals to connect, share information, collaborate, and form friendships. Consequently, they have garnered considerable attention from researchers across multiple fields, including sociology, psychology, computer science, and more. The rapid growth of online social media has led to an unprecedented increase in the volume of social data available. For instance, Facebook now boasts over one billion active users. However, analyzing large amounts of social media data poses challenges due to its complex nature. To address these challenges, researchers have focused on developing effective representations for social networks. These representations aim to capture the various aspects of social networks while remaining manageable when dealing with large datasets. Among these approaches, matrix factorization techniques have shown great promise, as they allow for the representation of social networks using low-rank matrices. Matrix factorization decomposes an adjacency matrix into two smaller matrices (i.e., latent factors), which effectively capture the structural properties of the underlying graph.",

The dependence of these correlations is determined by a specific function, which we relate to the final equilibrium state. This approach allows us to derive our explanations directly from experimental data without relying on any additional parameters. Our results provide valuable insights into the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum systems and can be experimentally tested using ultracold atoms trapped in various lattice configurations.\n\n**I. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\n\nThe advancement of techniques for trapping and manipulating ultracold atomic systems has opened up exciting opportunities for investigating strongly correlated quantum matter beyond thermal equilibrium. Recent experiments have demonstrated how delicate quantum systems can evolve from their ground states while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external parameters. In this context, we examine scenarios where the system undergoes a quench across a phase transition. For instance, if the system is initially confined in a harmonic trap, it will expand freely once the confining potential is removed. Alternatively, the system could be prepared in its ground state before undergoing a rapid change in another parameter, such as a magnetic field. In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will significantly depend on whether the system was initially close to equilibrium or not. If it was not, the system will relax into a metastable state, whose properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibrium state.",

Such flows may play important roles in regulating the growth of supermassive black holes through their effects on both the surrounding gas and radiation fields. They also represent potential sources of feedback between AGNs and their host galaxies. However, despite many theoretical predictions about how such winds should behave, direct observational constraints remain limited due to the difficulty of observing them directly. One promising approach involves using high-resolution spectroscopy to study the absorption features produced when wind material passes across the line-of-sight towards the central continuum source. Recent observations of several nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies show clear evidence for variable absorption lines arising from photoionized plasma flowing outward from the nucleus at velocities ranging from ~100-1000 km/sec (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2002; Crenshaw & Kraemer 2003; McKernan et al. 2007 ).

These outflows may play a crucial role in the growth of supermassive black holes by influencing the surrounding gas and magnetic fields. They also help explain the relationship between AGNs and their host galaxies. However, despite theoretical predictions regarding the behavior of such winds, observational evidence has been challenging to obtain due to the difficulties in directly observing them. One promising approach involves using high-resolution spectroscopy to analyze the absorption features created when ionized material flows across the line of sight to the continuum source. Recent observations of Seyfert 1 galaxies have shown clear evidence of variable absorption from photoionized plasma moving outward at velocities ranging from approximately 100 to 1000 km/s (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2002; Crenshaw & Kraemer 2003; McKernan et al. 2007). Here, we present another example of this phenomenon through a Chandra/HETG observation of Cygnus X-1, the brightest member of the class of Galactic black hole candidates (GBHCs), located just 2 kpc from Earth.",

        "original_text": "We present an accurate and efficient fundamental-measure density-functional (FMT) approach to describe fluids composed of rigidly-aligned hard hexagons, which are relevant as model systems for liquid crystals or colloidal suspensions with anisotropic interactions. The FMT is based on a decomposition into three different types of weighted densities that can be evaluated efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. We show how this new FMT yields excellent results compared to Monte Carlo simulations over wide ranges of packing fractions and orientations of the particles. In particular we find very good agreement between our theoretical predictions and simulation data at high packing fractions where previous approaches fail due to strong correlations among neighboring particles. Finally, we demonstrate that our method also allows us to accurately predict structural properties such as pair correlation functions and orientational order parameters. This work provides further evidence that FMTs provide a powerful tool to study complex fluids beyond simple spherical particle models. \nI.

We demonstrate that this advanced FMT approach produces excellent results when compared to Monte Carlo simulations across a wide range of packing fractions and orientations. Notably, we observe a strong correlation between our theoretical predictions and experimental data at packing fractions where previous methods struggled due to the intricate correlations among different configurations.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe study of liquids and complex matter necessitates sophisticated models due to their intricate structures and dynamics. Density functionals have emerged as promising tools for tackling various challenges in statistical mechanics. They facilitate the determination of equilibrium properties by minimizing a functional with respect to the number density distribution. A notable class of density functionals is the so-called Fundamental Measure Density Functionals (FMD), originally introduced by Rosenfeld. These functionals were initially designed for dense fluids composed of identical particles, but recent extensions have been proposed for more complex shapes, including ellipsoids, rods, dumbbells, spherocylinders, and patchy particles. However, most existing research has concentrated on systems with uniaxial symmetry, with relatively few studies addressing more general scenarios. In this work, we examine a system of rigidly-aligned particles.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is one of the most prominent models in the study of non-equilibrium dynamics. It describes the behavior of particles hopping along a line of L sites under specific rules: each site i (where i = 1, ..., L) can hold at most one particle; if a site is unoccupied, a particle can hop to the right with a certain rate; otherwise, it cannot move until the site is vacated. This model has garnered significant interest due to its rich stationary states, which exhibit various phases depending on the parameters involved. For instance, particles can accumulate at the leftmost sites while exiting from the rightmost site at specified rates. When the rates are equal (e.g., when the entry and exit rates are both set to 1/2), the stationary state becomes independent of the initial configuration. Conversely, when the entry rate exceeds the exit rate, the stationary state displays phase separation, while the opposite scenario leads to shock profiles. These characteristics make the ASEP a compelling subject for further exploration.",

This suggests that our proposed measure may provide an explanation for why we do not observe any remnants of the early universe: if there are too many possible histories, then most will have very different properties than ours. The holographic principle has been used extensively over recent years to study quantum gravity on asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. In particular, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes was shown to agree exactly with the entropy associated with the degrees of freedom localized near the event horizon. However, these results were obtained only after assuming that the boundary conditions satisfied by fields propagating through AdS space corresponded precisely to those required to preserve unitarity. It would therefore seem natural to ask whether similar techniques could also be applied to more general spacetimes such as de Sitter space.

We suggest that this embedding is related to the volume of the space at the leading order, but it increases exponentially during inflationary periods. This implies that our proposed framework provides insight into why we do not observe any remnants of the entropy: if there are too many significant fluctuations, then most will differ greatly from our own. The holographic principle has been extensively applied to quantum modifications in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. For instance, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes has been shown to correlate with the entropy associated with the degrees of freedom near the event horizon. However, these findings were only confirmed after it was established that the fields propagating through AdS correspond to those that preserve unitarity. It remains uncertain whether similar methods could be applied to more complex spacetimes like de Sitter space.

Introduction\n\nThe investigation of polarized emissions provides valuable insights into the magnetic fields present in various astrophysical environments, ranging from planets to distant galaxies. However, accurately estimating the level of polarization can be challenging due to instrumental issues such as depolarization and calibration errors. This challenge is exacerbated when analyzing faint signals with low signal-to-noise ratios. To address these issues, researchers have employed statistical techniques to estimate the intrinsic properties of their samples. For instance, Hovatta et al. (2012) examined the distribution of Stokes parameters using Monte Carlo simulations to derive the mean values and standard deviations of their samples. They discovered that the average levels of polarization were generally higher than those reported by other studies analyzing similar datasets. Similarly, Lister & Homan (2005) assessed the polarization properties of bright quasars using a maximum likelihood method to fit Gaussian distributions to the Stokes parameter histograms. Their findings revealed that the polarization of quasars exhibited both circularly and linearly polarized components.",

Our approach closely follows the methodology outlined in Ref. 1, where the authors examined the effects of massless scalar fields on the standard model, particularly focusing on the emission rate of Hawking radiation.",

Initially, we describe the viscosity as being influenced by the interactions among the particles, while the thermal conductivity behaves oppositely. Transport properties such as viscosity and thermal conduction are crucial in various fields, including astrophysics, geophysics, and other physical sciences. These properties are heavily influenced by the microscopic dynamics of the system. Recent studies have shown that the effective viscosity of granular materials is significantly affected by whether particles can bounce off each other after colliding elastically. In this context, we consider a model involving two species of particles that interact through binary collisions. Each particle belongs to either species A or species B, and particles from different species do not collide directly; instead, their interactions are mediated by a background medium. This scenario is particularly relevant in mixtures with significant differences in mass and/or interactions between components.

These systems offer exciting opportunities to investigate novel phenomena such as supersolids, soliton dynamics, and orbital interactions. In this study, we consider a specific scenario involving two distinct components (e.g., different hyperfine states) that interact via s-wave scattering. Such interactions naturally arise in mixtures of hyperfine states or isotopes within the same atomic species. For example, experiments with 87Rb and 41K have successfully produced mixtures of two different hyperfine states through evaporative cooling. Another potential combination involves 40K and 6Li, where one species can be viewed as impurities within a background gas of heavier fermions. Alternatively, if the masses are comparable, the heavier species could serve as impurities.",

The most widely accepted model of evolution posits that species evolve primarily through vertical transmission, meaning they pass their genetic material directly from parent to offspring. However, there are instances where this model does not adequately explain genetic inheritance; specifically, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can occur between two lineages, resulting in what is known as reticulate evolution. For example, when a virus infects a host, its genes can be transferred across the host's cellular machinery; similarly, if two species hybridize, their offspring may inherit genetic material from both parents. In these cases, HGT creates a network-like relationship among the descendants of the common ancestor, rather than a straightforward lineage.",

They offer unprecedented opportunities for high-precision measurements. Our goal is to utilize them to enhance our understanding of the fine structure constant. To achieve this, it is essential to accurately measure the frequencies of the transitions (1s2p 3P1) = 929,072,631,770 Hz and (1s2s 3S1) = 929,073,761,828 Hz in helium.

Introduction\nIt has been established that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs). An SMBH can gain mass through accretion via a surrounding accretion disk. Since the discovery of quasars over 30 years ago, observations have revealed that most AGNs exhibit broad emission line profiles in their spectra, indicating the presence of rotating accretion disks. However, theoretical models suggest that such disks should become unstable if they rotate too rapidly. This raises the question of how these disks maintain stability. One possibility is that the broad lines are stabilized by magnetic fields or relativistic effects. In this letter, we investigate the dynamics of accretion disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that account for both gas pressure and self-gravity. Our primary objective is to determine whether the surface density distribution of the disk is uniform or exhibits spiral structures, and if the latter is the case, to identify the underlying causes.\n\n2.

However, there are unresolved issues within the SM, such as the masses of fermions and neutrino oscillations, which cannot be adequately addressed by its framework. To tackle these challenges, various extensions beyond the SM have been proposed. Among these, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) offer a compelling solution to the aforementioned problems. GUTs predict the existence of superheavy gauge bosons, known as GUT gauge bosons, with masses on the order of 10^16 GeV. The interactions of these GUT gauge bosons lead to a non-renormalizable scenario that affects the SM gauge symmetries. Consequently, these bosons should not appear in any observable processes, implying that their contributions must cancel out when summed over all states.

Our approach draws inspiration from random walks, but it incorporates Grover's techniques alongside the Hadamard matrix to enhance efficiency. We demonstrate how this innovative technique can be applied to the GIP, particularly when the number of vertices in both graphs is equal or differs by at most one. Additionally, we compare our results with other contemporary methods in the field. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing efficient solutions to computational complexity problems, such as the GIP. This problem involves determining whether two graphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure regardless of the labels assigned to their vertices. Traditional methods for tackling the GIP often utilize Random Walk techniques combined with various heuristics, but these approaches can require exponential time in the worst-case scenario. In contrast, quantum algorithms offer polynomial-time solutions to NP-complete problems, including the GIP. These algorithms exploit superposition, allowing them to explore multiple states simultaneously. For instance, Shor's Algorithm efficiently solves integer factorization in polynomial time, while Grover's Search can locate an item within an unsorted database in quadratic time.",

In contrast, very few low-mass planets have been identified, as they tend to produce weaker signals compared to their more massive counterparts. Consequently, there is a notable gap in the distribution of low-mass planets among the known extrasolar systems, ranging from Earth-like to Neptune-like sizes. Therefore, it is essential to search for these smaller planets, as they can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. One effective method for detecting low-mass companions is through high-angular resolution observations made with space telescopes like HST. Such observations allow us to analyze the motion of the host star and its potential companions. If we assume that the observed motion is solely due to gravitational interaction with another body, we can measure the projected position and velocity of the companion. By combining these results with precise orbital dynamics, we can derive the mass of the companion.",

        "original_text": "The PVLAS collaboration has recently reported results on light-by-light scattering in vacuum, which are inconsistent with Standard Model predictions.  In this note we discuss possible interpretations of these data within the framework of quantum field theory and string theory. We argue that the most natural interpretation is to assume that the observed effect arises due to new particles coupling to photons via an effective dimension-8 operator. The required mass scale for such particles can be as low as 10 GeV or even lower if one assumes that they couple only weakly to ordinary matter.

These findings provide evidence against the presence of fermionic quasiparticles in the normal state of these materials. Furthermore, they suggest that the pseudogap phenomenon shares certain characteristics with superfluidity in high-temperature cuprate superconductors, which exhibit a diverse array of ground states. It has been proposed that these materials undergo a quantum phase transition into a novel state as the pseudogap evolves. This transition appears to occur between underdoped regions, where there are no long-range order parameters but only short-range correlations, and overdoped regions, where antiferromagnetism is absent. The pseudogap is believed to play a crucial role in understanding the mechanisms behind superconductivity at the critical temperature (Tc).

Introduction**  \nDuring solar flares, the solar atmosphere experiences rapid changes in physical conditions, including temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, intense magnetic fields, varying densities, and significant velocities. These changes affect different layers of the solar atmosphere. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the intensity ratios between two Fe I lines formed at different heights depend on the altitude of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips, 2004). Additionally, the presence of nonthermal electrons leads to deviations from Maxwellian distributions, resulting in asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al., 1990; Doschek et al., 1991), while bulk motions contribute to Doppler shifts in the line profiles (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips, 2004; Brosius, 2009). Therefore, studying the line profiles provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the flaring region. However, interpreting this data requires a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes responsible for the observed variations. The Mg II h and k lines present unique opportunities to investigate the effects of solar flares due to their broad range of formation heights.",

        "original_text": "We report on the absorption spectrum of an isolated single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) in solution, obtained by using a scanning near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and illuminated through one electrode at normal incidence to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigated the absorption spectrum of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in solution using a near-field differential microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs were suspended between two gold electrodes, and light was directed through one electrode at normal incidence to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized modes. We found that the TE modes are strongly coupled to the TM polarization due to the presence of modified excitons within our sample. This coupling can serve as a spectroscopic tool for identifying the chirality of SWNTs. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have garnered significant interest because they exhibit modified optical properties that are highly sensitive to their chirality and diameter. Theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies have demonstrated that the optical properties depend on these parameters, with semiconducting nanotubes having small band gaps and metallic nanotubes exhibiting larger optical responses. However, this relationship is not sufficient to uniquely identify all types of nanotubes. To determine the type of each nanotube individually, various experimental techniques have been employed. For instance, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence can differentiate between metallic and semiconducting nanotubes based on the intensity of their optical signals. Additionally, electrical transport experiments provide insights into charge carrier density and mobility. Transmission electron microscopy allows for direct visualization of the nanotube structure. In this study, we present another method for determining the chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes by measuring their absorption cross-section. Since the absorption cross-section is influenced by the dielectric environment, which varies significantly between metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, we anticipate different values for their absorption characteristics. By comparing the absorption cross-sections of various SWNTs, we aim to demonstrate how this technique can effectively classify them into metallic or semiconducting categories.",
