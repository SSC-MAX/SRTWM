We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

This suggests that the evaporation of a black hole does not merely result in a standard black hole with a thermal spectrum, but rather a fuzzy black hole characterized by non-commutative elements.

        "original_text": "Bayesian deformer models have been widely used in medical imaging, computer vision and AI. However, the computation of Bayesian deformer models is often challenging due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. Recently, variational inference (VI) algorithm has been proposed and shown to be efficient in calculating the approximate posterior distribution in Bayesian deformer models. In this paper, we develop a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) based on VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency. The proposed method is firstly derived in a general Bayesian deformable model, and then applied to some specific Bayesian deformer models for demonstration. Our experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our method is more efficient than the existing VI algorithm and comparable with the state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm in calculating Bayesian deformer models. The primary contributions of this work are two-fold: (1) We propose a SAA-based VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency of Bayesian deformer models. Our method is applicable to a broad range of Bayesian deformer models and shows higher efficiency than existing VI algorithm in some cases; (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on real world datasets.

Conversely, the absence of relativistic emissions from several SNRs, such as 0509-67.5, 1572, and Cas A, indicates that many SNRs may not generate relativistic particles.

This model successfully predicts the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today, prompting comparison to similar models in the particulate physics domain, where a similar level of agreement has been achieved through the use of quantum zero-point energy.

The most compelling evidence supporting the dark matter hypothesis to date comes from a cosmological model that describes these macroscopic structures, notably the Cold Dark Matter model. This model effectively predicts the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today, especially when compared to other models in particle physics, which have achieved similar levels of agreement through quantum mechanics. \n\nHowever, the Cold Dark Matter model is not without its challenges.

This index is then utilized to characterize the long-term trends in Solar Wind Speed (SW speed) observed over the past 450 years. The components of SW speed are identified as having two distinct elements: a periodic component with a cycle of approximately 11 years and a gradual long-term increase. The IHV index closely correlates with variations in SW speed, with changes in SW speed reflecting shifts in the IHV index. Overall, the SW speed exhibits an increasing trend at a rate of about 20 km/s per century. This trend has significant implications for space weather, as the increasing SW speed directly affects the amount of energy carried by the Solar Wind.",

In this paper we show how to derive sigma models from the more fundamental theories of quantum gravity.

This provides a geometrical interpretation of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity dynamical variables as an (2+1)-dimensional analogue of the relativistic membrane. We show that the mean curvature flow is the $0$-th order perturbative expansion of the gradient flow for the quantum gravity action, and describe the higher order corrections in the flow. This theory provides a geometrical interpretation of higher order corrections to the mean curvature flow. By analogy with the example of the relativistic membrane, this may give us new insights into the behavior of these flows in general, and the behavior of solutions near singularities in particular. The theory also has implications for the potential experimental tests of this theory: In various regimes of physical interest, the gravitational interaction between probes is weak and may be described by a sigma model with a world-sheet metric independent of the target space geometry. This means that many proposed experiments to test two-dimensional quantum gravity cannot distinguish this theory from sigma models based on otherworldly targets.

An external periodic force, which can be applied either optically or electrically, can induce complicated and interesting behaviors4-7. In this Letter, we report a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme to find high-dimensional chaotic attractors in the semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber. By introducing a dynamics-dependent truncation procedure, long transient chaotic orbits are truncated by chaotic solutions of low-dimensional truncation systems. With this truncation scheme, we are able to observe novel dynamical behaviors in semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber, such as intermittency and bifurcations from torus to strange attractor. Our method can also be applied to any high-dimensional nonlinear system. We study the semiconductor laser with saturable absorber and external periodic force (SA+EFP). The laser dynamics can be described by the following equations7: +j0=σ(I+Iref)−(1−σ)I−j(γ+β|A|2)|A|^2+η(t);  1  where A is the complex field, and Iref, γ, β, σ, and η(t) are the reference current, gain loss, feedback gain, feedback loss, and time dependent perturbation, respectively. |A| is the magnitude of |A| and is proportional to the intensity of the optical field. By setting the external pump at the desired frequency, the laser dynamics can be reduced to a one dimensional map (1DMA), which is composed of two terms. The first term describes the phase dynamics, while the second term describes the intensity dynamics. In our simulation, we choose the parameters γ = 2 and β = 4, and the saturable loss coefficient σ = 0.8. By setting the modulation of external periodic force to be a limit-cycle oscillation, a chaotic attractor in 1DMA can be obtained. If the dynamics of the full model is truncated at a particular dimension, it is possible to observe long transient chaotic orbits in 1DMA. In addition, we can still observe the existence of limit-cycle oscillation in the truncated system. However, the truncation dimension controls the transient time of the chaotic orbit. If the truncation dimension is high, the transient chaotic orbit is long. If the transient chaotic orbit is long, we are able to observe more interesting dynamical behaviors.

An external periodic force, which can be applied optically or electrically, can influence and modify these behaviors. In this letter, we present a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme designed to effectively generate Lyapunov-Wilkinson attractors in a semiconductor system equipped with a saturable absorber. By implementing a dynamics-dependent truncation approach, we can truncate long transient chaotic orbits by focusing on the stable solutions of lower-dimensional truncation systems. This method allows us to explore novel dynamical phenomena in semiconductor systems with a saturable absorber, including intermittency and bifurcations from toroidal to chaotic attractors. Our technique is applicable to any high-dimensional nonlinear system. We analyze the semiconductor system with a saturable absorber and an external periodic force (SA + EFP). The dynamics can be described by the following equations: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\sigma(I + I_{ref}) - (1 - \\sigma)I - j\\left(\\gamma + \\beta |A|^2\\right)|A|^2 + \\eta(t)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) represents the complex field, and \\(I_{ref}\\), \\(\\gamma\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\sigma\\), and \\(\\eta(t)\\) denote the reference intensity, gain coefficient, carrier gain, saturable absorber coefficient, and time-dependent perturbation, respectively. The magnitude \\(|A|\\) corresponds to the intensity of the optical field. By adjusting the pump parameters appropriately, we can reduce the dynamics to a one-dimensional map (1DMA), consisting of two components: one that describes phase dynamics and another that accounts for intensity dynamics. In our analysis, we set the parameters to \\(\\sigma = 2\\) and \\(\\beta = 4\\), with the saturable absorber coefficient \\(\\sigma = 0.8\\). By configuring the modulation of the periodic force to create limit-cycle oscillations, we can observe experimental attractors in the 1DMA. If the dynamics of the model are truncated at a certain threshold, it becomes possible to sustain long transient chaotic orbits within the 1DMA. Additionally, we can manipulate the characteristics of limit-cycle oscillations in the truncated system. However, truncation affects the duration of the chaotic orbit's transience. A higher truncation threshold results in longer transient chaotic orbits, allowing for the exploration of more complex dynamical behaviors. For instance, if the transient chaotic orbit is sufficiently long, we can observe phenomena such as intermittency and bifurcations from toroidal to chaotic attractors. Conversely, if the transient orbit is too brief, the dynamical behavior of the laser may not be discernible.",

Thus, even when the logic formula is over a small set of variables, model checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HOF logic) is np-hard. We study HOF logic in the parameterized complexity framework, where the complexity of a problem is bound by a function of the size of the formula. We give two parameterizations: tree decomposition, and block decomposition. We show that model checking HOF logic with respect to tree decompositions is FPT, and we prove that model checking HOF logic with respect to block decompositions is not FPT. Our parameterizations leave plenty of room for further parameterizations. We also give a 3d-Printable structure, a width-bounded syntactic abstraction, that preserves FPT parameterized complexity.",

However, in certain contexts, determining whether a given model satisfies all fixed points of a higher-order logic can require solving a Picard iteration, which involves finding an optimal fixed point for every instance of the logic. Consequently, when the logic is constrained to a limited set of parameters, model checking in Higher-Order Fixed Point Logic (HOF logic) becomes NP-hard. We investigate HOF logic within the framework of parameterized complexity, where the complexity of a problem is related to the structure of the formula. We present two parameterizations: tree decomposition and block decomposition.

The observations from 2023 confirm that it is not on a collision course with Earth. This research underscores the importance of wide-area surveys in the early detection of potential threats. While rapid response searches for near-Earth objects are crucial, high-precision astrometry combined with extensive observational campaigns can help identify objects like (144898) 2004 VD17 well in advance of any potential hazards. The integration of comprehensive data sources, such as radar observations, can provide valuable insights for characterizing potential threats and enhancing the effectiveness of response and mitigation strategies.",

        "rewrite_text": "In this paper, we explore a model for the early universe that incorporates a dynamic scalar field alongside a Chaplygin gas. The Chaplygin gas represents a class of models characterized by a scalar field with an effective negative pressure that is solely dependent on the density of the modified gas. We treat the components of the model, including the Chaplygin gas, as two distinct fluids. We analyze the dynamics of these fluids and their physical implications. Our findings indicate that this system of equations supports a non-singular inflationary solution. Additionally, we calculate the perturbations produced by this dynamic and examine their dependence on various factors. We demonstrate that the scalar spectrum of density perturbations remains invariant for super-Hubble modes, aligning with observational data. By modeling the primary components as a dynamic system, we can accurately describe their modifications resulting from interactions among the different components. This approach leads us to identify non-singular inflationary solutions and compute the associated scalar perturbations.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion.

Observations of the spectrum emitted by central supernovae serve as a crucial method for revealing the nature of their progenitors.

Although there are various components associated with these platforms, the most prevalent progenitors of core-collapse supernovae are well-documented, with massive stars (approximately 8 solar masses and above) being linked to certain supernova subtypes. One specific subtype, Type Ia supernovae, has been instrumental in refining our understanding of cosmological distances and is believed to originate from white dwarfs that accrete material from a companion star. \n\nThese white dwarfs, which are descendants of massive stars, are often identified as luminous blue variables (LBVs), proposed as potential progenitors for a less common class of core-collapse supernovae.

I explore various theoretical constructs that are not adequately captured by quantum mechanics, such as classical fields and the harmonic oscillator, and demonstrate how they can be effectively described using classical theories if one accepts that the quantum realm influences the processing of information. Ultimately, I propose that this information can be articulated using terms like \"knowledge\" or \"information,\" allowing us to connect quantum mechanics to knowledge theory and information management in a manner similar to classical information theory. I also discuss how this conceptual framework could provide a theoretical foundation for advancements in machine learning and information processing.",

The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory.

We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion.

As in classical Lorenz models, the dynamical variables in the Kolmogorov-Lorenz system consist of three state variables which denote the magnitude of velocity, density and temperature fluctuation, respectively.

The investor’s objective is to maximize the expected utility from terminal wealth under general semimartingale dynamics. Since the underlying random endowment is unbounded, the classical notions of absolute and relative performance become inapplicable. We adopt an approach by coupling the investment and the underlying dynamics to define an a.s. supermartingale. Then we construct a sequence of admissible strategies with the patience to wait for the coupling event to occur. The corresponding optimal value is obtained by a dynamic programming principle. We study two versions of the problem: one with restricted trading and the other without any restrictions. We characterize the value function for the restricted case and show the value function is equal to that for the original problem when the patience times of the two strategies are the same. We also provide an approximation method via refining the approximation spaces of strategies. Our approach applies to a much broader family of utility functions and allows for a much wider range of applications. We provide several examples to illustrate our results.

The investor's objective is to maximize the expected utility at the terminal time under semimartingale dynamics. Given that the random endowment is unbounded, the traditional methods for performance evaluation become ineffective. We propose a new approach by refining the dynamics to establish an almost surely supermartingale. Subsequently, we develop a series of admissible modifications to address the challenges posed by the problem. The optimal value is determined using a dynamic programming principle. We analyze two scenarios: one with restricted trading and another without any constraints. We characterize the value in the restricted case and demonstrate that it aligns with the value of the unconstrained problem when the parameters of the two scenarios are identical. Additionally, we introduce a component method that enhances the approximation of strategy spaces. Our findings extend to a broader class of problems and have implications for a wider range of applications.

In comparison to less luminous quasars, these high-redshift objects exhibit extremely high X-ray emission densities, making them valuable for studying the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Our findings indicate that the highest-redshift quasars have X-ray properties similar to those at lower redshifts, but with equivalent widths (EWs) and X-ray luminosities approximately ten times greater. This emission is likely produced by thermal corona gas in the host galaxies, with X-ray emissions differing accordingly. When compared to a radio-selected sample with similar X-ray luminosity, these quasars show significantly lower radio emissions than expected based on models that suggest the quasar's excess gas is funneled into a hot, kiloparsec-scale torus. The reduced radio emission suggests that, at lower redshifts, quasars may be less obscured than their local counterparts. We propose that this could be attributed to the brighter cosmic background at higher redshifts, which may penetrate more easily through a hypothetical torus.

        "original_text": "The gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303 is composed of a compact object, most likely a black hole, accreting from the gas captured by the companion star. The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

The binary system has a highly eccentric orbit, with a period of 12.8 days and an apastron distance of 5.5 AU. The presence of eclipses and dips, along with the highly polarized gamma-ray emissions and the signature of a collimated jet, indicates that the black hole is the primary source of radiation, with occasional flares as it draws in material. The dynamics of this system have been the subject of debate, with some researchers proposing the existence of a third body, while others support a colliding-winds model. In the latter scenario, the stellar wind from the companion compresses and accumulates a circumbinary disk around the black hole, which is responsible for the observed gamma-ray emissions. In this study, we evaluate these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods. Our main finding is that the accretion model, although more complex, is better at explaining the multiwavelength data. This model suggests that an accretion disk forms due to material from the companion star, which is likely funneled toward the black hole through a hot, magnetized outflow. The rate of material capture varies with respect to the black hole's orbital plane, indicating a steady but variable supply to the disk. Thermal interactions between the disk and the black hole's magnetic field lead to the formation of an external accretion disk, which can produce emissions through synchrotron or magnetically dominated processes. In contrast, colliding-winds models propose that the companion is a Wolf-Rayet star, characterized by strong winds that collide and create a complex, partially ionized region of gas and emission. While the concept of colliding winds has been widely discussed, we argue that this model cannot adequately explain the multiwavelength emission characteristics of LS I +61 303, which suggests that the system should exhibit radio-quiet behavior.

If the observed discrepancy continues to hold, it could signal a significant shift in our understanding of neutrinos and prompt a reevaluation of the current model. However, addressing the statistical and systematic uncertainties remains crucial, as improvements in sensitivity have not yet significantly impacted the established three-neutrino model.",

Here, we present the first microscopic theory for the correlated orbital dynamics in ferromagnetic manganites. We use a multi-orbital Hubbard model for the Mn $3d$ electrons with large separation of Mn $3d$ and O $2p$ orbitals. The model describes the competing interactions in the system and, in particular, accounts for the Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ local spins, which are considered as pseudo-spins. The crucial input of the model is the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the Mn $e_g$ electrons, which is performed in the framework of the Hubbard lattice approach. We find a ferromagnetic orbital liquid phase with vanishing order parameters for the conventional (canted) orbital order and the ferromagnetic one. The Fermi-surface nesting causes a strong renormalization of the bare interactions and leads to the orbital polarization at small JT couplings and a tiny interval of Hund’s coupling, which we estimate from realistic band structure calculations.

Thanks to observations made between 2014 and 2018 with the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes, we were able to characterize Pluto's shape, size, and brightness. This work contributes to a growing list of light curve data for KBOs, starting with 1994 QB1 and including notable objects such as 2012 VP113, Varuna, Haumea, Makemake, Eris, and (136108) 2004 BF3. By determining Pluto's light curve, we can also refine our estimates of its size, reinforcing its status as the largest KBO and helping to constrain the sizes of other KBOs.",

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass. We also compare our findings to those of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the peak metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters is broadly consistent with the highest values seen in simulated galaxy cluster cores. However, at present, it is not clear whether observed abundance trends with host spheroid mass can be reconciled with the highest-redshift galaxies in the simulations.

Unlike traditional approaches that focus on minimizing the error by learning the statistics of the channel state information (CSI) at the platforms, we assume that the platforms possess only a single state, specifically perfect CSI at the moment. We first determine the maximum average distortion-rate for the infinite backlog scenario. Next, we characterize the average distortion for the leader-buffer configurations and extend our findings to scenarios with vanishing delay. Our results indicate that while CSI can enhance performance in varying SNR conditions, it is crucial to understand how it influences the average distortion across all SNR values.",

The molecular cloud is located in the southern celestial hemisphere around 5.5 kiloyears away, which makes it the most remote object for which a spatial mapping of thedistribution of molecular gas has been performed so far. Using the Nobeyama radio observatory, we have mapped the carbon monoxidedistribution in a sample of 25 nearby spiral galaxies and found that barred spiral galaxies have a larger quantityof molecular gas than non-barred spiral galaxies at the same optical luminosity. We propose that the strongerbars, which are associated with bigger bulges, stabilize the potential, and this in turn promotes theformation of more molecular gas. It is now well known that barred spirals are more abundant in the universe than non-barred spirals, which indicates that bars are important mechanisms in the evolution of galaxies. Our finding supports the view that bars promote the evolution of the host galaxies, probably by promoting the transfer of gas to the central region1,2. The gas there forms stable circumnuclear regions and through SF produces new generations of stars, leading to the formation of bigger and bigger bulges. 1 Athanassoula, E.; Parijs, G. *Origin of Bars in Disk Galaxies*.

        "rewrite_text": "In 1703, a remarkable reasoning by the amateur astronomer Georgius Barwick has gained interest today as the Nobeyama molecular cloud. This molecular cloud is situated in the northern celestial hemisphere, approximately 5.5 kiloyears away, making it one of the most distant regions where the distribution of molecular gas has been studied. Utilizing the Nobeyama radio telescope, we have mapped the distribution of carbon monoxide in a sample of 25 spiral galaxies and discovered that barred spiral galaxies contain a greater amount of molecular gas compared to unbarred spiral galaxies of similar luminosity. We propose that the stronger bars, associated with larger bulges, stabilize the galaxy, which in turn facilitates the formation of more molecular gas. It is now understood that barred spirals are more prevalent in the universe than unbarred spirals, suggesting that bars play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies. Our findings support the idea that bars influence the distribution of gas within galaxies, likely by funneling gas toward the central regions. This gas then forms circumnuclear regions, contributing to star formation and leading to the development of larger bulges. \n\nReferences:\n1.

Calculations were performed using the method of rapid adiabaticfollowing, which permits the description of non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a mixed normal-Wigner representation Hamiltonian. The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position. These two structures differ by the orientation of the molecular axis. In the following, we will refer to the 2x2 O2 structure as “bent” and to the 1x2 O2 structure as “linear”. Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments. This excitation could also lead to the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localised on top of the linear structure is initially involved in the dissociation process, in good agreement with available experimental data. This means that the associative pathway is adiabatic. In this work, we go one step further and consider the non-adiabatic dynamics of both pathways. For that purpose",

These calculations utilize the rapid adiabatic following method, which effectively captures non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the position-dependent Schrödinger equation using a mixed normal-Wigner Hamiltonian. The method is first validated against experimental data for both associative and dissociative pathways. The findings represent the first comprehensive non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of O2 molecule dissociation on the Al (111) surface. It is observed that non-adiabatic effects significantly influence both associative and dissociative pathways by affecting the transition state ensemble. The role of the substrate in the dissociation process is also thoroughly examined. These simulations provide the first insights into the non-adiabatic dissociation dynamics of O2 molecules on the Al (111) surface. The results indicate that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, while the associative pathway remains adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative route, non-adiabatic effects are pronounced at the transition state, whereas they are minimal in the associative pathway. Ultimately, the simulations reveal that the substrate plays a crucial role in the dissociation process. The Al (111) surface supports two distinct configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 configuration corresponds to the molecule being positioned with an excess atom at the top sites and two atoms located at the bridge sites, while the 2x2 structure corresponds to a bent arrangement with the excess atom at the hollow sites. These two configurations differ in terms of molecular orientation. In this context, we refer to the 2x2 O2 configuration as \"bent\" and the 1x2 O2 configuration as \"linear.\" Initially, the O2 molecule is situated atop the surface in the linear configuration, either at the top or bridge sites. A sufficiently strong excitation could lead to a rearrangement of the molecular orientation towards the substrate in the 1x2 configuration. The nuclear wavepacket associated with this excitation has a significant presence in the linear structure's position and diminishes in the bent configuration. The simulations indicate that the molecular orientation is located above the bridge sites of the Al surface, consistent with experimental observations. This excitation could also facilitate the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localized at the top sites is actively involved in the dissociation process, aligning well with experimental data. This suggests that the associative pathway is indeed adiabatic. In this context, we further explore the non-adiabatic dynamics of both pathways.",

These simulations, however, cannot reproduce the full distribution of galaxy properties at both low and high redshift. It has been suggested that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars may play a role in regulating star formation in their host galaxies. In this paper, we present high resolution, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of a sub-set of galaxies in a single volume of a large, modern simulation, in which a simple model for radio-mode feedback is included. The model is characterized by a constant Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole, which is adjusted so that the AGN contributes a specified amount of radio heating to the interstellar medium. We have selected a simulation which is volume-limited and resolves all galaxies above a given mass, and which includes the effects of stellar feedback, AGN feedback and the evolving gas properties from the larger simulation. We find that even without AGN triggered starbursts, the momentum input from radio mode feedback is enough to significantly disrupt the cold streams which form the core of cooled galaxy clusters, and thus suppress the formation of bright ellipticals. At the same time, this feedback is not sufficient to disrupt the clusters completely. In lower mass galaxies, below the critical cluster mass, we do not see significant suppression of star formation, although we do find a decrease in the concentration of stellar metallicity and stellar density. We conclude that while radio-mode feedback is an effective regulator of star formation in the early universe, it alone is not sufficient to reproduce the full distribution of galaxies across the Hubble sequence.",

Our findings suggest that without AGN-induced starbursts, the input from radio emissions significantly disrupts the interstellar medium, affecting the cooling processes and suppressing the formation of bright elliptical galaxies. However, this disruption is not enough to completely eliminate the clusters. In regions with high radio emissions, we do not observe significant suppression of the interstellar medium, although we note an increase in stellar metallicity and density.

These perturbations become exponentially small when the wall density is low and the distance between the boundaries is significantly larger than the sphere size. Utilizing this perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the average density of the system is influenced by the confinement volume. We then investigate how confinement affects the structure factor, revealing that it also varies with the volume of the system. Additionally, we provide a detailed examination of the sound speed and inter-diffusion coefficient, showing that these properties remain unaffected by changes in the confinement volume. Our findings suggest that confinement has minimal or no impact on the average entropy, enthalpy, viscosity, and self-diffusivity of the hard-sphere fluid.",

The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously.

We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions. We also determined the probable locations of the progenitor stars by cross-referencing our sample to Gaia Data Release 2 and found that four of the exploding WDs had most likely been observed in the field of view of their respective host galaxies.

        "rewrite_text": "We conducted a survey of six rapidly rotating white dwarfs (WDs) exhibiting magnetically dense accretion events. This study utilized the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which continuously monitors the entire sky every few hours. Such observations had not been made previously for these specific WDs, as earlier studies focused on different types of WDs. The events we observed are characterized by a rapid increase in brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a decline. The plateau phase is attributed to the interaction of the rotating WD with an accreting material or a companion star. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of specific features in the subsequent light curve, which are not observed in cases of steady burning on the WD surface. The duration and luminosity of these events align with expectations for the explosion scenario. We compared our observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion processes, both with and without magnetic fields, and found that the emissions were better represented by simulations that included magnetic fields. We determined that magnetic fields of approximately 100 MG are necessary to drive the observed phenomena, which is consistent with the capabilities of facilities like the Exawatt Center for Plasma Research in the EU and NASA's Long Duration Balloon program. Our study focused on six WDs, all previously monitored by ASAS-SN. Among these, four exhibited plateau-like light curves with distinct features in the days leading up to the explosion, corroborating previous findings of magnetically influenced events from slowly rotating WDs. Two objects, SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, displayed unique features without the preceding brightness increase, consistent with magnetically driven events from rapidly rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed durations and luminosities to simulations that included magnetic fields and found that the emissions from both types of simulations were consistent with our observations. By analyzing the durations and luminosities, we calculated the expected properties for each event and found them to align with theoretical predictions for such explosions. Additionally, we cross-referenced our sample with Gaia Data Release 2 and discovered that four of the WDs were likely located in the fields of their respective host galaxies. This supports the notion that rapidly rotating WDs are more detectable from their host environments compared to those from slowly rotating WDs. Our findings suggest that magnetic fields play a significant role in the explosion mechanisms of these astrophysical events, indicating that further research in this area could yield valuable insights into rapidly rotating WDs.",

In this paper, we show that for a particular choice of coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields, this higher dimensional spacetime admits a higher symmetry, and the theory appears in one higher dimension as a dual gravitational theory with a doubled number of spacetime dimensions. Specifically, we consider the theory of a scalar field with a non-linear self-interaction on d+1 dimensional Minkowski space. The corresponding equations of motion have a critical point corresponding to empty spacetime. We show that by introducing a new scalar field conformally coupled to the first one, the system admits a higher symmetry, and reduces to a theory in d dimensions with an emergent ((d-1)+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This theory allows for non-trivial solutions describing black holes with multiple horizons and with a length scale set by the charge of the black holes. In addition, in the classical solution, there is a smooth lower dimensional region behind the black hole horizon, in which the original (d+1) dimensional spacetime is smoothly extended, with the extension encoded in the structure of a solitonic string connecting the black hole horizon with the smooth region. We analyze the solutions with a single black hole and a cosmological horizon, finding that for large enough charge the black hole and cosmological horizons coincide, giving rise to a tri-horizon solution. We compute the entropy of the black holes in the dual gravitational theory, and find that it matches the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black holes in the tri-horizon solution.

These emergent spacetimes are demonstrated to emerge in a bottom-up manner from consistent structures within a higher-dimensional spacetime, incorporating relativity in d dimensions along with a scalar field. In this framework, we illustrate that for a specific configuration of interactions between the scalar and other fields, this higher-dimensional spacetime supports a richer structure, and the various configurations can be viewed as a duality with a doubled number of spacetime dimensions. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a scalar field with a non-trivial interaction in a (d + 1)-dimensional Minkowski background. The modified equations of motion correspond to an empty spacetime scenario. By introducing a new scalar field that is conformally coupled to the original one, the system exhibits enhanced symmetry, leading to a configuration in d dimensions with an emergent (d - 1) + 1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This framework allows for non-trivial solutions that yield metrics with black hole horizons and exhibit behavior influenced by the charge of the black holes. Furthermore, in the obtained solution, there exists a smooth region behind the black hole horizon, where the (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime is structured, with the connection encoded in a solitonic configuration linking the black hole region to the smooth area. We analyze solutions featuring a black hole and a cosmological constant, discovering that for large charges, the black hole and cosmological horizons merge, resulting in a tri-horizon solution. We compute the entropy associated with the black hole in the dual framework and find that it matches the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole in the tri-horizon solution. Finally, we note that the solutions of the cosmological model resemble the Reissner-Nordström solutions in higher dimensions, which are intriguing in their implications. We conclude with a summary of our findings and potential extensions. \n\nDate: January 30, 2023  \nAuthor: Jose Antonio Burroni  \nTitle: Dual Field Theories in (d-1)+1 Emergent Spacetimes from a Unifying Field Theory in d+2 Spacetime.  \nAbstract: In essence, the concept of emergent spacetime has been introduced to facilitate the unification of components with other physical theories, particularly quantum mechanics.

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface.

        "rewrite_text": "The title of the paper encapsulates the central theme of the abstract. The abstract is lengthy as it provides background information on the topic and includes additional commentary on the paper. Neutron stars are the celestial bodies formed primarily from neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no electric charge and an atomic mass number of one. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, with a mass greater than that of the Sun compressed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. These stars are created as a result of supernova explosions, during which approximately 99% of the original mass is compressed into a much smaller volume. Such extreme densities occur because neutrons are significantly more massive than normal particles, and the gravitational force that holds the star together weakens as one moves closer to its core. When a neutron star reaches a mass of about 2 to 3 solar masses, there is insufficient pressure to counteract its own gravity. The excess mass is expelled during a supernova explosion, which also serves as a brief pause in the star's evolution. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, less commonly, a black hole. These systems are referred to as Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are particularly interesting because they allow us to study the behavior of matter from two different perspectives. The first state, known as quiescent (or at rest), occurs when the neutron star orbits a companion star without emitting X-rays. The second state occurs when the neutron star temporarily emits X-rays during an outburst. When an LMXB transitions between these two states, it reveals differences in behavior. For instance, recent studies have shown that brighter outbursts are associated with an increase in the neutron star's accretion rate. Conversely, when the star is in a quiescent state but emits slightly more X-rays than usual, its accretion rate is found to be higher than when it is significantly fainter. These behavioral differences have led to the development of a two-state model for LMXB behavior. In this model, there are two distinct accretion regimes onto the neutron star, characterized by different mechanisms of material deposition onto the star's surface. The first regime, called \"spherical accretion,\" involves protons sticking to the star's surface, forming a spoon-shaped structure. These transients are brighter when the accretion rate is higher. The second regime, known as \"indirect accretion,\" involves material forming a cloud around the neutron star. These transients are observed to be brighter when the system is in a more active state.",

This phenomenon can be explained by the concept of our brane existing within an anti-de Sitter (AdS) LED, which has a negative cosmological constant. In this framework, the four-dimensional nature of our universe arises from a conflict between the conservation laws applicable to our brane world and the ongoing dynamics of the AdS LEDs. In standard cosmological models, the CMB is produced by photons that decouple from matter after the early universe's hot phase. These photons travel across the observable universe before reaching us, and the observed CMB spectrum reflects the cumulative energies of all these photons from their creation until they are modified by interactions. If our universe were purely four-dimensional without any extra dimensions, the conservation of energy would hold true, as all processes would occur uniformly.

Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space.

The majority of three-dimensional curves are singular and exhibit generic properties, often being transversal to various components. Singular curves are classified by their genera, which correspond to their codimensions in the parameter space. A significant body of work on singular curves emerged in Catalonia during the 1980s and 1990s, particularly through the efforts of Harris and the contributions of Coppo and Garrone. These studies established a deformation-theoretic framework for understanding the birational properties of such curves, specifically their capacity to be infinitesimally deformed into other configurations. This framework also suggests that for a given curve, there exists a plane within the nine-dimensional projective space of quadric hypersurfaces that the curve does not intersect; this plane is referred to as an exceptional plane. Curves that possess exceptional planes are termed decomposable. This situation becomes complex when the curve is non-decomposable, as it will have an exceptional plane (up to projective equivalence). Such curves are classified as non-decomposable. A common scenario arises when the exceptional plane serves as a plane of linear dependency for the general curve, known as an exceptional secant plane.

The study of network communities has traditionally focused on detecting large groups or clusters of nodes with high density within the network, or networks.

Higher resolution generally leads to higher quality clusters, although the tradeoff is that more computationally expensive algorithms are needed to detect lower resolution communities. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical method for community detection that identifies both large and small communities at many resolution levels.

Among the six types of quarks, only two—up and down quarks—are found in the protons and neutrons that make up ordinary matter. The other four quarks, known as charm, strange, top, and bottom, exist in particles called hadrons, which interact through the strong force. The strong force binds quarks within protons and neutrons, and the mass of a hadron is a measure of this binding energy. Quarks behave like tiny magnets and come in six different \"colors,\" a term used in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to describe their properties. These colors correspond to a mathematical structure known as an octet, with each quark flavor having specific charge values—up quarks have a charge of +2/3, while down quarks have a charge of -1/3. The remaining quarks, charm, strange, top, and bottom, also combine to form hadrons. For instance, a bottom quark contributes to the charge of bottom hadrons, which are weakly interacting particles. In the framework of the Standard Model, quarks are considered fundamental constituents of matter, and their interactions are governed by QCD. This theory effectively describes the properties of hadrons, including their mass and decay processes. A key aspect of QCD is confinement, which means that quarks are never found in isolation but always in combinations that form hadrons. According to the phenomenological quark model, the most common quarks in nature are up, down, and strange, along with their corresponding hadrons. Hadrons constitute hadronic matter, which is prevalent in the universe, including in planets and stars. However, when studying hadronic matter, physicists often encounter particles that are either fragments of hadrons, like beta particles and pions, or stable hadrons such as protons and neutrons. These combinations of hydrogen and helium are referred to as ordinary matter. Quarks are also present in other exotic states, but their behavior in those contexts differs from that in ordinary matter. Due to their much higher mass compared to the quarks that make up ordinary matter, these exotic quarks are typically found within hadrons, which bind them together. The fundamental theory describing the strong interaction between quarks is quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which, despite extensive experimental validation, remains an area of active research. One of QCD's predictions is related to the behavior of heavy particles, such as lead nuclei.",

This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density. This provides a mechanism by which the universe can undergo a phase transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of nonequilibrium, or a cooling dominated phase transition.",

This background radiation holds immense significance as it provides insights into the conditions of the universe at that time. Recently, researchers have proposed a model suggesting that this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical fluctuations in the early universe. The model describes these fluctuations as zero-point variations, influenced by every conceivable virtual interaction in this quantum framework. As the universe expands and its temperature decreases, these virtual fluctuations tend to settle into the lowest energy states, creating a background of virtual radiation.\n\nHowever, this model has a notable limitation: it does not treat the fluctuations as a continuous field but rather as discrete events. This can be likened to a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water, where the boiling represents the dynamic nature of the early universe. In this analogy, the boiling water corresponds to the energetic environment, while the sticks represent the fluctuations. The particles in this model, which are akin to the photons of the CMB, have not been fully accounted for. As the universe cools, these photons tend to occupy the lowest energy states, achieving equilibrium with the surrounding environment. \n\nWhen the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons no longer remain in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the environment, leading them to move away from areas of higher density toward regions of lower density. This behavior can be compared to a memoir left out in the cold; as the bottle cools, water molecules gravitate toward the bottom, creating a denser region. In this revised model, we consider a scenario where the photons remain stationary while the background environment evolves. In this case, the environment acts like a frozen landscape where the fluctuations settle at the bottom, while the photons continue to propagate throughout the universe. As the universe cools, the fluctuations tend to spread out, while the photons settle into regions of varying density. This framework allows for a transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to one of non-equilibrium, marking a cooling-dominated phase transition in the universe's evolution.",

On regular networks, the epidemic will extinguish if the average degree of connectivity is lower than a certain threshold, while it will die out spontaneously if the average degree is higher than that threshold. In contrast, when the networks are heterogeneous, the behavior of the epidemic changes; it can persist in a differentiated manner if the average degree of connectivity exceeds a specific value. Furthermore, in scale-free networks, the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak decreases as the exponent of the edge distribution increases. These networks exhibit stability in their diverse states. If the average degree of connectivity is below a critical threshold, the epidemic will be contained; however, if it exceeds this threshold, the epidemic can spread significantly, although it may still die out spontaneously in regular networks.

Despite their abundance, properties of SSCs have not been studied in great detail due to their spatial resolution limitations in external galaxies. This has recently changed with the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which has allowed the discovery of much fainter SSCs in the centers of nearby galaxies. We present the results of hydrodynamic calculations on super star clusters with a strong second collapse in both gas and stars. The second collapse forms a second population of stars that can significantly impact the global properties of the SSC. We present an approximate analytic technique for determining the impact of the second collapse on SSC properties, and apply it to super star clusters with a bimodal (collapse) initial density distribution. We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles.

We find that the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a charged pion can be well approximated by considering the Schrödinger equation for a simple potential model, where the coupling between quark and diquark is parametrized by an effective coupling constant. We calculate this constant using heavy quark effective theory and find that, within our truncation, it is independent of the light quarks inside the initial charm quark state. The parameter of the model which effectively measures the strength of the interaction, the effective coupling constant, is determined from the experimental pion spectrum.

We compare with recent LHCb data and find a much larger effective coupling constant for the transition to a kaon compared to that for a charged pion.

        "original_text": "Mechanistic home range analysis (MHRA) is a widely used method for estimating home range size. The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours. We demonstrate the utility of the steady-state space use area by comparing it to the area estimated using MHRA and by using it to reduce the number of model runs necessary to estimate home range size.",

        "rewrite_text": "The Mechanistic Home Range Analysis (MHRA) is a method used for estimating home range projections. This approach consists of two main steps: first, the home range is modeled as a combination of candidate spatial distributions, and second, rapid numerical optimization is employed to refine the home range model to best fit the observed data. In the initial step, the method primarily focuses on statistical characteristics of the modified components (e.g., point differentiation), utilizing a substantial and expanding body of knowledge about fine-scale modifications to inform the candidate spatial distributions. Many of these models are variations of home range estimations, and various combinations of these spatial parameters are tested against the data collected. While these models can quickly assess spatial variable combinations, all spatial configurations are evaluated, and combinations that have not been previously used are also considered. The recommended approach involves a global search that allows for rapid collaboration on the spatial variable modifications that best fit the observed data. \n\nMHRA is particularly useful for estimating home range requirements in large sample sizes; however, the need for multiple model runs can limit its practicality. For instance, estimating home ranges for 10 individuals may require 45 different model runs, each representing a unique spatial configuration. Consequently, MHRA demands significant computational resources and extensive modeling efforts. \n\nIn response, we have developed a straightforward analytical model that can estimate home ranges more efficiently. This steady-state model is applicable when data is collected continuously over an extended period. While analytical models share similarities with mechanistic movement models, they do not estimate the same parameters. Instead, they focus on estimating the home range area based on subtle modifications while remaining computationally efficient. We integrate this model with a global search optimization technique to create a tool that quickly estimates the home range area that best fits the observed data. \n\nThe area calculated using this new method differs from that obtained through MHRA, but both serve as valid indices for home range estimation. For smaller sample sizes, the new method can provide accurate estimates with just one model run, compared to the 45 required by MHRA. Moreover, the new method computes the home range area in seconds rather than hours. We validate the effectiveness of this new approach by comparing it to the results obtained from MHRA and by assessing the number of model runs needed to estimate home ranges accurately.",

This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community. Since 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals.

Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost.

Additionally, inflation can significantly impact project budgets, and similar projects completed at different times may incur varying costs due to unforeseen delays or design changes.

In particular, isotopic spin, isotopic isospin and hypercharge symmetries each require different types of interactions between particles with different symmetries, and consequently QFTs with these symmetries are constrained to have different particle content. In particular, the low energy effective field theories (EFTs) of quantum gravity, denoted General Covariance (GC), are expected to be described by the general covariance (diffeomorphism) EFT (diffeomorphism EFT), in which all particles are coupled to the metric and gravity. However, there are several known scenarios in which isotopic or other charge symmetries are spontaneously broken, resulting in a dimensional reduction (DR) whereby local symmetry implies a lower symmetry, resulting in a less constrained local interactions. Several classes of such scenarios are based on extended gravity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity (dS/PSR) scenarios. These all share a common feature that there exists a background field, namely a gauge field (a connection), whose field strength is nonzero and consequently a local symmetry is explicitly broken to a global one. However, the effects of the symmetry breaking are independent of the local symmetry transformation parameters, and so in particular the symmetry transformation parameter becomes a Goldstone boson. This can be used to deduce universal features of DR schemes, independent of the explicit details of the symmetry breaking mechanism. For example, it is expected that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will result in a reduced local symmetry, with the local symmetry transformation parameter corresponding to a Goldstone boson. In particular, for the minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity scenarios, there is an exact symmetry between the local de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, resulting in an exact Goldstone boson equivalence. Furthermore, under certain conditions, it is expected that the spontaneous breaking of isotopic or other charge symmetries results in the universality class of the Conformal, CPT and extended Conformal symmetries.

Additionally, effective field theories (EFTs) of quantum gravity, particularly those adhering to General Covariance (GC), are expected to be formulated within a diffeomorphism-invariant framework, where all fields interact with the metric and other components.

Importantly, the nature of this symmetry breaking is independent of the specific local parameters, resulting in the emergence of a Goldstone boson. This phenomenon enables the derivation of universal features of DR schemes, regardless of the specific details of the underlying models. For instance, it is anticipated that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will yield a reduced effective theory characterized by a Goldstone boson. In the cases of minimal de Sitter and Projective Special Relativity, there exists a relationship between de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, which is reflected in the equivalence of Goldstone bosons.

To ensure that the observed wobble is indeed due to the planet and not other factors such as noise, a confirmation method was required, which involved measuring the Doppler Shift of the star's spectrum and detecting the planet's mass around the host star. This method proved effective, leading to the confirmation of numerous exoplanets. However, in subsequent years, a noticeable decline in the number of confirmed exoplanets was observed. While the reasons for this decrease remain unclear, several factors have been suggested, including the possibility of false positives. In this paper, I will explain false positives, discuss why they pose a problem, and present a remote mathematical confirmation method that can reduce the occurrence of false positives.

This approach begins by accumulating materials in a designated area and allowing them to flow into the surrounding environment.

To address this issue, an alternative method is proposed, which involves spraying a solution around the affected area and then using experimental forces to disperse it. The article further develops a probabilistic model to evaluate this new approach. Initially, it presents a probabilistic framework to assess the excess materials in the environment and demonstrates that this method effectively cleans the area. The findings indicate how much material this method can effectively manage. The analysis reveals that for certain environments, this method can significantly improve conditions, but it can only remove about 50% of the actual contaminants present.

Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe. We provide an example of how the existence of this weakly interacting massive particle dark matter could be established or disproved by measuring the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our galaxy.",

This is particularly intriguing because electron neutrinos can scatter off matter with minimal interaction with the particles themselves.

The intensity of this so-called \"differed\" neutrino signal, first detected by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in 1998, can only be explained by the existence of massless Majorana neutrinos, a concept introduced by Ettore Majorana in 1937. The first evidence for these neutrinos was found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration reported the first experimental evidence suggesting that neutrinos could be their own antiparticles, indicating the potential existence of Majorana neutrinos. Despite its significance, the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in cosmology. The prevailing model for dark matter, involving weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), suggests that they interact via the weak force and should produce detectable signals in neutrino telescopes. However, observations from satellites like Planck and the Dark Energy Survey have constrained the maximum interaction cross-section of WIMPs to values much lower than those of neutrinos. This diminishes the likelihood of WIMPs being the primary component of dark matter. Neutrino oscillations can explain solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, making neutrinos a compelling alternative to dark matter. If neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, they could account for a portion of dark matter by producing a specific signal of electron neutrinos. This process can be likened to how a lightbulb emits light when electricity flows through it: the interaction of neutrinos with matter could generate detectable signals. Given the evidence for non-baryonic matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we propose that the observed neutrino signals may arise from electron neutrinos scattering off dark matter, potentially explaining about 30% of the total dark matter density.

Therefore, it is of interest to consider how the distributions of these characteristics may vary across different random graph models. Here we focus on two such characteristics, the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph, both of which have well-understood algorithmic techniques that allow for their exact determination for arbitrary random graphs. By employing a variety of random graph models, we find that the size of the largest planar matching exhibits a power-law distribution for every model considered, while the largest planar subgraph exhibits a power-law distribution in some models and exhibits a different, more exponential-like, distribution in others. Notably, we find that the power-law exponents for the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph are closely correlated with the exponent associated with the degree distribution of the graph. This suggests that the tail behavior of the distribution of these characteristics is most strongly influenced by the presence or absence of a wide variety of high-degree vertices within the random graph model.",

In this study, we focus on two specific cases: the size of the largest planar component and the size of the largest planar subgraph, both of which utilize modified algorithmic techniques tailored for their respective structures within random graphs.

The effectiveness of this method was evaluated using a sample of 48 stars, for which rotational periods, effective temperatures, and surface gravities were obtained through alternative means. The reliability of the method, as anticipated from its underlying principles, was also assessed using this sample. A key limitation arises from the dependence of the rotational period on various factors, leading to a degeneracy between age and metallicity. The associated error margins are also examined. The sample was drawn from the IAC-80 visual binary catalog, which was modified to include 48 G-type stars for which rotational periods, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities were available. The projected equatorial velocities were derived from the rotational periods, calculated using rotational metrics and data from the Infrared Flux Method. Using the Babel code, an estimate of the gyrochronological ages was produced. The derived surface gravities were compared with actual measurements to evaluate the accuracy of gyrochronology in determining the ages of G-type stars. The effectiveness of the method was analyzed using a two-sample t-test, comparing the results with those from traditional methods and other age-determining techniques. The findings indicate that gyrochronology is a reliable method for estimating the ages of G-type stars, with an average error of -2.2%, suggesting that for most cases, the gyrochronological estimates are within 10% of the true ages. The limitations of the method stem from the dependence of the rotational period on various factors, which creates a degeneracy between age and metallicity.

We also gathered contemporaneous data in other bands (X-ray, MeV, GeV) from the Whipple, HEGRA, and CAT observatories. Our observations indicate that PKS 2155-304 was in a high state in April 2005, potentially reaching a flux density of 400 mJy at m_R. The NIR flux density remained relatively stable during this period, showing no significant variations. However, around May 20-25, 2005, we observed a sharp increase in both the optical and NIR fluxes, peaking in June 2005. The spectral index hardened rapidly during this time, possibly reaching a value of α = 3.2. We hypothesize that this sudden brightening of PKS 2155-304 was triggered by a rapid increase in the external radiation field density, likely due to the eruption of the nearby galaxy M33, which affected the relativistic jet of PKS 2155-304. Additionally, we noted a rise in the X-ray, MeV, and GeV fluxes during the May to July 2005 period. We suggest that this increase was due to the jet entering a region with a weaker magnetic field, influenced by the varying transparency of the environment caused by the external radiation field.",

While many characteristics of QGP were confirmed during the LHC Run 1, the recent detection of novel photon emission patterns from the QGP, reported by the ALICE collaboration, introduces new insights. In this context, we demonstrate that the QGP can emit virtual photons with an intensity that depends solely on the system's parameters and the modifications of the interactions, eliminating the need for a dynamic framework within the standard model of particle physics. The virtuality of the emitted photons, defined as the square of the modified momentum at which the induced propagator vanishes, is influenced by temperature. Consequently, the emitted photons' characteristics are essential to understanding the ALICE anomaly. Our proposed framework is not limited by Lorentz invariance, allowing it to apply to any QGP-like system exhibiting significant thermal fluctuations and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. To explore this concept, we analyze the uniqueness and robustness of QGP thermodynamics to make predictions about photon emission from strongly coupled systems, which we compare against experimental data from quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

We explore trends in joint applicability by analyzing technology classes using a combination of descriptive and hierarchical Bayesian techniques. Our findings indicate that joint applicability has fluctuated over time, with notable increases in the early 2000s, likely due to the rapid advancements in the semiconductor industry and the proliferation of mobile technologies. Additionally, we observe that joint applicability varies geographically, being more pronounced in regions with strong technology ecosystems, such as the Kanto region in Japan and California in the United States.

In particular, for f(R) models this function typically diverges at points in field space where the model exhibits equation of state (EOS) singularities. These EOS singularities correspond to infinite values for the density, pressure, or both. In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of these EOS singularities, focusing on the specific case of finite-time singularities. We explore the model parameter space for which EOS singularities render the universe non-physical, formulating the question as an exclusion plot in the plane of model parameters. We show that such an exclusion plot is significantly restricted by existing data from SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and direct detection experiments, allowing for only a small region of this parameter space. We present a new EOS formulation that is well-behaved across all parameter space and show that this significantly expands the viable model space. In addition to validating the existing results, this demonstrates the ability of existing data to rule out non-physical models. Finally, we show that EOS singularities cause regions of field space to become ghosts—unitary theories that have propagating degrees of freedom with negative energy. Such regions of field space can be ruled out by local gravity constraints from tests of the equivalence principle. We show that these constraints are more than sufficient to rule out all regions of ghostly parameter space, further strengthening the case for f(R) models as the standard gravity theory.",

        "original_text": "The high energy emission of GRO J1655-40 as revealed with INTEGRAL spectroscopy of the 2005 outburst is described. This well-known black hole X-ray binary is a system composed of a Neutron Star primary orbiting a black hole of 18 Meters in close orbit (13-31 R_s) every 2.87 hours. It is suspected that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as evidenced by its spectral class of Z-source, which is characterized by having strong, sometimes regular, neutron star high-speed winds. These winds are likely due to the transfer of energy from the accretion disk onto the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was detected with the INTEGRAL observatory on Jan. 28, 2005, and reached a maximum on Feb. 24. The work presented here focuses on the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 over this time period. The major result of this work is the discovery of acutoff powerlaw component in the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, with a flux contribution of approximately 50% over nearly 3 decades in energy. This component is not commonly observed in X-ray binaries, and therefore its discovery with INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high energy production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the accretion disk blackbody component which is often seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and is generally thought to be the signature ofNETWORK GAMMA RAYS radiated by the inner part of an accretion disk around a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a neutron star at its core, represents a new paradigm for high energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, and may indicate that disk accretion is not the only form of high energy production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is the result of a new form of high energy production unique to this system, which may be a result of the strong neutron star winds. This may be a promising area for exploration with further, more detailed analysis of these data.",

This spring-burned black hole X-ray binary system consists of a neutron star orbiting a black hole with a mass of 18 solar masses at a close distance (13-31 R_s) every 2.87 hours. Evidence suggests that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as indicated by its classification as an HM class Z-source, which is known for exhibiting regular, high-speed winds. These winds are likely a result of material being transferred from the accretion disk to the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was detected by INTEGRAL on January 28, 2005, peaking on February 24. The modified analysis focuses on the high-energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 during this outburst. A key finding is the presence of a cutoff power-law component in the high-energy spectrum, which shows a significant increase of about 50% over a range of 3 keV. This component is not typically observed in X-ray binaries, making it a unique aspect of the INTEGRAL observations and providing a new framework for understanding production mechanisms in these systems. The cutoff power-law component is thought to extend from the accretion disk blackbody component commonly seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and it is generally associated with gamma-ray emissions produced by the inner regions of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole. The presence of this cutoff power-law in GRO J1655-40 suggests a new paradigm for understanding gamma-ray production in black hole X-ray binaries, indicating that disk accretion may not be the sole mechanism for energy production in these systems. It is proposed that this component results from complex interactions related to the high-speed winds observed, presenting an exciting avenue for further investigation and detailed analysis of the data.",

Recently, variations of Bloom filters have been employed for straggler detection in data platforms, particularly those with large memory and modified architectures.

Most of these proposed EOSs are based on a transformation of the many-body QHS Hamiltonian such that the quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent mean-field system, with a corresponding introduction of a  quantum liquid  equation of state (EOS) for the nuclear quantum many-body system. This paper critically evaluates this new class of proposed EOSs. After presenting a general critique of the various assumptions underlying the various proposed EOSs, we present a detailed analysis of the proposed EOS for neutron matter, which yields significantly improved analytic results over those previously proposed. We then apply these analyses to a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter, yielding improved analytic results compared to both the widely used QIG EOS and the previously proposed neutron matter EOS. This improved performance is achieved through a new constraint on the EOS, based on nuclear saturation properties at low densities, and a more sophisticated fit to the high-density behavior of the EOS. Finally, we present analytic and numerical results for a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter that yields an EOS that is simultaneously consistent with both the general critique presented and with the detailed analyses of the neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter EOSs. This paper presents a new class of proposed equations of state for nuclear matter that are more consistent with both nuclear many-body theory and experiment than the widely used Quantum Ideal Gas (QIG) equation of state. These new equations of state, which we refer to as Quantum Hard-Sphere (QHS) equations of state, begin by rewriting the many-body Hamiltonian in second quantization in terms of creation and annihilation operators that satisfy the usual commutation relations. Next, the many-body Hamiltonian is transformed such that the nuclear quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent system of non-interacting particles (the  mean-field  system) that can be analyzed using standard classical many-body theory techniques. This leads to a new class of proposed equations of state for nuclear matter. The Hamiltonian for the equivalent mean-field system is parameterized in terms of an effective interaction energy and a chemical potential, with the effective interaction energy given by the second virial coefficient of the original many-body Hamiltonian. This parameterization of the Hamiltonian allows the authors to fit the predicted EOS to both nuclear many-body theory results and nuclear matter ground state properties. The proposed equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter is then analyzed in detail, yielding significantly improved analytic results over both the widely used Quantum Ideal Gas equation of state and the previously proposed equation of state for neutron matter. Finally, the proposed EOSs are shown to be consistent with a more general class of proposed equations of state by relaxing one of the key assumptions underlying the model.",

Most of these proposed EOSs are based on a refined version of the primary QHS Hamiltonian, allowing the quantum system to be represented as an equivalent field theory. This approach introduces a quantum liquid EOS for the corresponding quantum system. This study evaluates this new class of proposed EOSs. After outlining the general criteria for assessing these EOSs, we provide a detailed analysis of the proposed EOS for dense matter, which yields significantly improved analytical results compared to earlier models. We then extend these analyses to a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter, achieving analytical results that surpass those of both the QIG EOS and previously suggested EOSs for nuclear matter. This enhanced performance is achieved through a careful constraint on the EOS, focusing on saturation properties at relevant densities and employing a more sophisticated approach to the density-dependent behavior of the EOS. Finally, we present both analytical and numerical results for a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter, which aligns well with both experimental data and detailed analyses of nuclear matter and symmetric nuclear matter EOSs. This work contributes to a new class of proposed equations of state for dense matter that are more consistent with both theoretical predictions and experimental observations than the conventional Quantum Ideal Gas framework. These QHS equations of state are derived by reformulating the primary Hamiltonian in a quantized manner, utilizing creation and annihilation operators that respect the necessary commutation relations. Subsequently, the transformed Hamiltonian is structured so that the quantum system can be analyzed as an equivalent field theory, employing standard techniques from quantum field theory. This leads to a new class of proposed equations of state for nuclear matter. The Hamiltonian for the equivalent field system is parameterized in terms of effective interaction parameters and a virial coefficient, allowing for the prediction of the EOS to be compared with both theoretical results and experimental data. The proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter is thoroughly analyzed, yielding significantly improved analytical results over both the QIG EOS and previously proposed models for nuclear matter. Ultimately, the proposed EOSs demonstrate consistency with a broader class of equations of state, reinforcing their validity through key experimental benchmarks.",

In particular, a fundamental quantity in the QCD calculation of the hadronic spectrum is the Wilson loop, which, in the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop $C$ in space-time.

Our findings indicate that exploded fibrations with surface fibers are smooth orbifolds with certain characteristics, and we establish a factorization of the map to the classifying space as a composition of a smooth map with another smooth map onto the classifying space of a densely defined gerbe. \n\nWe present two examples of exploded fibrations: the mapping to the intended modification of a Riemann surface with two distinct components, and the classifying map of a surface fibration over another surface. Additionally, we explore the homotopy properties of genuine fibrations. We define a *component fibration* as the homotopy fiber of a map derived from a topological fibration. Our results demonstrate that the homotopy type of a component fibration can be characterized by a simplicial structure with a well-behaved descent of degenerations. \n\nWe examine the relationship between a *weak equivalence* and a *component fibration*, providing two examples of these classes of maps: the exquisite fibration is weakly equivalent to the drafting of a topological fibration, and the homotopy fiber of a genuine fibration map is a turf fibration. We show that the homotopy type of a component fibration can be constructed from its homotopy stairs by extending functors that model fibrations, fiction fibrations, and weak equivalences. We conjecture a relationship between the homotopy types of these model structures at the level of homotopy categories, anticipating that these structures will serve as models for interest maps, genuine maps, and weak maps between topological spaces.\n\nOur primary example of an exploded fibration is the classifying space of a group. We demonstrate that this space is weakly equivalent to the associated space of a certain interval with a specified structure, and that its fibration space is homotopy equivalent to the permutation space of a specific topological fibration. Finally, we discuss the parallel structures of vectors on exploded fibrations. We define a *smooth differential* or instanton as a quadruple consisting of a differential on the total space, a path through the base space, and two tangent vectors on the fiber over the base, ensuring that the tangent vectors on the base correspond to the base components and that the differential of the tangent vectors in the fiber along the path aligns with the components themselves. We conclude by presenting examples of smooth differentials and outlining directions for future research.",

The analysis of these data provides us with the first view of the central 10pc of this system and reveals the nature of its luminous infrared nuclear starburst (even in the presence of an active galactic nucleus,AGN) and its possible link with similar galaxies and their nuclear activity. The bright infrared nuclear starburst in NGC4418, shining as a dominant contributor of infrared luminosity in the Antennae system, has been known for many years (Braine et al. 1993, Downes & Solomon 1998). The origin of this starburst and its relation to the buried AGN was a long-standing mystery. New ALMA data of the luminous far-infrared molecular hydrogenCN (HC3N) v=0-1 infrared line emission has now provided us with a clear view of the dynamics and energy source in the central 10pc of this system. We detect high velocity outflowing motions in this region, of up to 400 km/s. This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).

In summary, our ALMA data of the nuclear starburst in the Antennae galaxies has provided us with a clear view of its nature and dynamics.

This framework is inherently global, linking different regions and yielding straightforward solutions that align with recent observations. Furthermore, in the presence of guide fields, the model simplifies to a wave-like structure, allowing for clear physical interpretations.

In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure. The properties of haloes in clusters are largely set by their major mergers since z &gt; 2, leaving them with short orbital times and low orbital kinetic energy. Conversely, the evolution of void haloes is more complex, with a mixture of processes at work.

The conclusion drawn is that the evidence for cosmic acceleration is inconclusive and may be influenced by data selection bias. \n\nThe notion of cosmic acceleration is a significant aspect of contemporary cosmology, having been reported by two independent research groups in 2014 and 2016, and widely accepted by the astronomical community. The prevailing theoretical framework suggests that a form of dark energy with an equation of state parameter \\( w < -1 \\) is driving this acceleration. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this claim have been critically examined and found wanting. \n\nIt has been shown that within various theoretical models, a very small value of \\( w \\) is compatible with the observed supernova data. The statistical methods employed to differentiate models with small values of \\( w \\) have been criticized for their inherent flaws. Additional studies have yielded similar findings. The Type Ia supernova data can be interpreted in a way that aligns with the hypothesis that cosmic acceleration is occurring, but not necessarily with the more conventional models that assume a flat or open universe. \n\nThus, the reported acceleration may stem from selection bias or the improper application of statistical techniques. The current state of research in this area is still evolving, and it is anticipated that a clearer understanding of the cause of acceleration will emerge as observational data improves and as more sophisticated models of the universe are developed. Until then, the acceleration of the universe should be approached with caution.",

The entanglement is generated between lightmatter qubits in a quantum frequency quadpter, distillation of the shared entanglement is accomplished in parallel on a cluster of nearby quantum computers, and a quantum signal reconstruction step is completed at a metropolitan node. Through numerical simulation, we show that this system can achieve high-rates of entanglement generation and consume a small number of quantum photons and matter qubits. Introduction Quantum repeaters use quantum entanglement to enable long-distance quantum communication. Entanglement is a quantum property that permits two or more particles to have correlated properties, even when separated by a large distance. Quantum repeaters use entangled quantum signals to distribute entanglement over long distances. Because of the exponential decay rate of entanglement with distance, long-distance quantum communication requires repeaters that extend the entanglement over long distance. Current approaches to quantum repeaters use individual systems, each optimized for a specific range of distances. Systems optimized for short distances, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through detection of either quantum side-channels or modification of qubits in transmission. These systems optimized for long distances, such as quantum memories, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through purification of largelyentangled quantum systems. Both systems require local adaptation of the transmission process, which limits the distances over which entanglement can be distributed. In this paper, we present a quantum repeater architecture that combines features from these optimized systems for short and long distances. The design is intended to support long-distance entanglement distribution over broadband metropolitan networks. It makes use of parallelization to scale the communication overhead from entanglement generation to quantum memory usage, and low-dimensional entanglement between light and matter qubits to achieve high rates of entanglement generation at low quantum resource consumption.

        "rewrite_text": "In this study, we present a quantum repeater architecture designed for long-distance, fault-tolerant quantum communication networks. We introduce a novel technique for generating entanglement and enhancing quantum computation through modified protocols. Our system is optimized for key performance metrics, including entanglement generation rate, resource consumption, memory usage, and pair production rate. Entanglement is created between light-matter qubits within a quantum device, while the distillation of this entanglement occurs on a cluster of quantum computers, with a quantum reconstruction process taking place at a designated node. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that our system can achieve significant entanglement generation with a minimal number of quantum photons and matter qubits.\n\nQuantum repeaters utilize quantum entanglement to facilitate long-distance quantum communication. Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon that allows two or more particles to remain interconnected, even when separated by large distances. Quantum repeaters leverage entangled signals to distribute this entanglement over extended ranges. Due to the exponential decay of entanglement with distance, long-distance quantum communication necessitates repeaters that can maintain entanglement over significant spans. Current quantum repeater approaches vary, with some optimized for short distances, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, which excel in entanglement generation through various quantum manipulation techniques. Others, designed for longer distances, focus on purifying highly entangled quantum systems. Both types of systems face challenges related to the harsh conditions of transmission, which restrict the distances over which entanglement can be effectively distributed.\n\nIn this work, we propose a quantum repeater architecture that integrates features from both short- and long-distance optimized systems. Our goal is to enable long-distance entanglement distribution across broadband metropolitan networks. This architecture allows for parallelization, scaling the overhead associated with entanglement generation and quantum memory usage, while facilitating entanglement distribution between light and matter qubits. The generation of entanglement is enhanced through light-matter interactions, where matter qubits are coupled with photons in quantum frequency converters (QFQs). These QFQs are fully integrated into networks that support multi-user connectivity and can be implemented using advanced photonic technologies. Our networks enable long-range entanglement distribution by leveraging parallel purification processes. However, previous purification methods were limited by the need to localize entanglement generation to specific areas. In our approach, we introduce a hybrid node that combines long-distance entanglement distribution with rapid processing, allowing quantum information to be reconstructed despite losses. By utilizing long-distance entanglement, we can effectively reconstruct quantum signals at the receiving node, facilitating robust entanglement distribution over extended distances.",

This low-energy QED description facilitates a controlled analysis of qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels. The predicted dispersive decay and dephasing rates are consistent with recent experiments. Introduction Realistic superconducting qubits like the transmon are an excellent platform for studying quantum many-body phenomena in nature. In particular, their highly tunable nature allows for an exquisite control of both system- and bath- dephasing processes. This exquisite control, however, has become an asset that now poses a challenge for sufficiently understanding and describing the underlying physical mechanisms. In this paper, we develop a detailed quantum electrodynamical (QED) description of interactions between realistic superconducting qubits and microwave radiation. The derivation is based on a high-fidelity derivation of the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian in  1 . Unlike other derivations in the literature, our starting point is a fully calibrated transmon model, that is, a model with the complete experimental control settings encoded. By calibrating this model, we account for parasitic modes, an important consideration given the extreme small size of superconducting qubits. A crucial result of this derivation is an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that includes the Jaynes-Cummings, Tavis-Cummings, and dipole couplings. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we obtain analytical expressions for qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels.

The paper presents a general framework for building a superconducting theory in a magnetic field. Such theory should be able to describe the superconductor below the critical temperature, as well as the magnetic materials with an Abrikosov vortices lattice at zero temperature. The starting point of the theory is to assume that the order parameter is a complex field that depends on both space and time. In this way, all the degrees of freedom associated with the magnetic field are included into the theory and the coexistence of superconductor and magnetic flux states can be described. Due to the complex nature of the order parameter, one needs to include many degrees of freedom to fully describe the superconducting state. To do so, one needs to resort to a many-body expansion of the free energy. For small coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic field, a local approximation is sufficient to capture the main physical mechanism. This is done by treating the superconducting and magnetic materials on equal footings by introducing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional. The theory is applied to describe superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale.

This theory aims to elucidate the properties of superconductors under various conditions, particularly when influenced by magnetic fields and the presence of Abrikosov vortices at zero temperature. The initial premise is that the order parameter is a complex field that is influenced by both spatial variations and external modifications. In this context, all degrees of freedom related to the magnetic field are integrated into the framework, allowing for a description of the coexistence of superconducting and magnetic states. Given the intricate nature of these interactions, it is essential to incorporate additional degrees of freedom to fully understand the superconducting state. To achieve this, we employ a low-energy expansion of the relevant equations. For small separations between the order parameter and the magnetic field, a simplified approach is adequate to capture the essential physical phenomena. This is accomplished by treating the superconducting and magnetic components on equal footing through the introduction of a new auxiliary field into the energy framework. This theory is particularly relevant for describing superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanoscale. In this context, the traditional London theory is inadequate, necessitating a comprehensive quantum mechanical treatment.

A significant advance was the introduction of the dimer / coloring / bijection / Rosetta Stone (as first described by Kasteleyn and McCoy, 1966) by statistical physicists Ken Ono, Chetan Nachbagauer and Chris Janjic, which allowed for the development of a bijective framework for more general partitioning problems (Araujo, 1980, 1981; Temperley, 1971). However, even this framework was unable to count certain multinomial coefficient partitions (e.g. partitions into squares) without extensive case-by-case analysis. In recent years, significant advances in computer algorithms have allowed for the study of these hard partitions via the Counting Principle (Dousse, Di Matteo, Rafieier and Cerf, 2013) and these algorithms have resulted in the enumeration of some hard partitions (e.g. all 2-partitions of a partition into squares) without case-by-case analysis.

Consequently, the depletion of hydrogen caused these stars to become core components, influencing the stellar dynamics of these early celestial bodies.

For example, the removal of nodes from a network characterized by a power-law distribution can lead to the elimination of nodes with specific properties, akin to a power law. It has also been suggested that heavy-tailed distributions may emerge from the aggregation of a small number of more common distributions. For instance, a truncated distribution can result from the superposition of common distributions. Notably, there are various types of distributions that arise from a limited number of generative mechanisms. For example, the distribution of settlement sizes may result from two generative scenarios: the growth of agricultural interests through the merging of smaller entities and the balance of these interests influenced by geographical and environmental constraints.",

There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy.

In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies.

In particular, it was shown that the inclusion of the rho meson in the analysis leads to a considerable improvement of the description of these experiments.

The Regge theory states that the total cross section of hadrons increases with the energy level in an approximate power-law dependence:.

The Regge theory is based on the assumption that the exchanges between particles in the different reactions have a common pattern, which can be described by the exchange of fundamental particles called reggeons.

According to Regge theory, the total cross-section of hadron interactions increases with energy, exhibiting a power-law dependence. This principle is particularly applicable to hadrons with high momentum, such as pions. Regge theory posits that the exchanges occurring in various reactions follow a common pattern, which can be represented by the exchange of objects known as reggeons. Reggeons correspond to intermediate states in quantum field interactions between two hadrons. G.V. Efimov first explained the fundamental aspects of hadron interactions at experimental energies within the quantum field framework using simple Regge theory. Subsequent theoretical and experimental investigations of these interactions have validated the core principles of this approach, particularly the universal behavior of reggeon exchanges. Pions play a crucial role in high-energy interactions due to their significant electromagnetic interaction capabilities. The Simple Isobar Model (SJC) describes the interaction between two pions, accounting for their decay processes. The SJC, which considers the exchange of one meson, is represented by the Born-Riley partial-wave framework. G.P. Lepage demonstrated that within the context of the Born framework and modified high-energy interactions, pomeron exchange can be understood as a combination of two reggeon exchanges. Thus, pions are integral to the description of these interactions.",

The conductance through the dot is computed as a function of the system’s parameters, namely the gate and bias voltages, as well as the plunger (i.e., orbital) number of the dot. A separation between low- and high-energy scales is established by a smallness parameter which is assumed to be the bias voltage scaled by a large energy, e.g., the plunger energy. Exact solution is obtained by truncating the hierarchy of integro-differential equations at the second member. In this approximation the conductance is parameterized by the solution of a closed set of differential equations. Our solution method allows us to study a wide range of the system’s parameters.

This dataset provides, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the star formation histories (SFHs) in DLAs. The new Y/Zn ratios as a function of metallicity allow us to test models with various SFH scenarios, including exponentially declining star formation rates. This significantly expands the range of SFHs that can be explored with the data. We propose that a two-component model with a 5 Gyr star formation history is the best fit for the observed data, complemented by a minor contribution from a more recent star formation event. This dataset will be instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the star formation history of galaxies, the chemical evolution of the universe, and in testing models of galaxy formation and evolution.",

The renormalization group (RG) has told us that this single coupling constant must evolve from a high energy value ofunity at high energy scales. By introducing an additional symmetry between the strong and electroweak forces, and a singlet scalar field under both, we can naturally give the coupling constant of the weak force a value less than that of the strong coupling constant, without the presence of any new particles.

However, if the potential of the scalar field has a lower bound, the contribution of the fluctuations of this field to the gravitational waves is not effective. In this work, we study the maximal amount of gravitational waves generated in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effects of the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution.

However, if the scalar field has an upper limit, the impact of these fluctuations on experimental observations becomes negligible. In this context, we explore the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves produced in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effective speed of modifications during inflation. We find that the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves in this scenario is equal to the value predicted by general relativity, Omega_GW = 1. This conclusion remains valid even if the scalar field has an upper bound.\n\nWe also examine the interaction between two scalar fields: the inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field accounts for the fluctuations in the number density of dark matter, while the inflaton field dictates the expansion rate of the universe. During the oscillation of the inflaton, the amplitude of gravitational waves is comparable to the effective speed, but it is slower than the maximum amplitude during the oscillation of the complex inflaton field. Consequently, the fluctuations of the scalar field that determine the number density of dark matter contribute to the gravitational wave spectrum characterized by Omega_GW, which is influenced by the effective speed of modifications.\n\nWe assert that the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves is equal to the value predicted by general relativity, Omega_GW = 1. Additionally, we analyze the perturbations of gravitational waves during the modified Hubble scales. The amplitude of these perturbations is dependent on the effective speed during inflation. If the effective speed is equal to the maximum speed, the amplitude of the perturbations is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed. This relationship has an upper limit of 1/3 for two-field models and 1/7 for single-field models.\n\nFinally, we discuss the gravitational wave background resulting from inflationary dynamics. If the effective speed exceeds the maximum speed, there are additional modes associated with the Hubble scale at the time of inflation, leading to a significant gravitational wave background. This scenario complicates the interpretation of gravitational wave experiments such as BICEP and LIGO/Virgo. However, if the effective speed matches the maximum speed, we achieve a consistent gravitational wave background aligned with the predicted values. We can construct a model with the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves by adjusting the properties of the scalar field within a defined limit, which sets the maximum effective speed during inflation. In this framework, it becomes feasible to explain the observed gravitational wave background while accounting for the fluctuations of the scalar field.",

Our model can be easily trained on the publicly available Flickr dataset, and can be readily deployed to other photo search platforms.

        "original_text": "Understanding the origin of ferromagnetism is one of the key issues in materials science. In this paper, we report an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice (specifically the Ti4+ sites), the crystal structure evolves to anatase type and acquires a net magnetic moment, which is found to be persistent above room temperature. This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem. In the supplementary material, authors have provided more experimental data and also some hints for the theoretical explanation of TDIM. First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic. Various mechanisms for the persistence of this net moment are explored. While substantial ionic coupling in Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is required to explain the observed moment value. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature of this moment is consistent with experimental results. Our work demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism to induce ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials. We have provided possible evidences to support the hypothesis that Ti4+ disorder accounts for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in a number of materials. Since Ti4+ disorder has been observed in a number of anatase type TiO2 samples, our work raises the possibility of persistent ferromagnetism in TiO2 based materials and related systems. This study was motivated by the recent report of persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. 1  While much research has been devoted to understand the origin of ferromagnetism in metals, understanding ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials is still an active area of research.

In this study, we observe an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a normally non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti ions are removed from the TiO2 crystal structure—specifically from the Ti4+ sites—the crystal transforms into the anatase phase and develops a net magnetic property that persists above room temperature. This Ti4+ induced magnetism (TDIM) has been identified in various modifications, including TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films, and nanotubes. We believe our findings will pave the way for further research in this area and encourage additional experimental and theoretical investigations into this intriguing phenomenon. \n\nIn the supplementary materials, we provide additional experimental data and theoretical insights regarding TDIM. Preliminary calculations indicate that Ti4+ ions, in conjunction with O2- anions in TiO2-anatase, contribute to a net ferromagnetic response. Moreover, our experimental results confirm the persistence of this magnetism up to at least 300 K, which contrasts with earlier reports suggesting that anatase TiO2 is non-magnetic. We explore various mechanisms that could account for this persistent magnetism. While ionic interactions at the Ti4+ sites are essential for explaining the observed phenomena, experimental evidence also suggests that orbital interactions play a significant role. The theoretically predicted behavior aligns well with our experimental findings. \n\nOur research demonstrates that Ti4+ ions are a key factor in achieving ferromagnetism in non-magnetic materials. We present compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that Ti4+ disorder is responsible for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in various modifications. Given that Ti4+ ions have been identified in several anatase TiO2 systems, our findings highlight the potential for persistent ferromagnetism in TiO2-based materials and related systems. This conclusion is further supported by recent reports of persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. While significant research has focused on understanding ferromagnetism in various materials, the exploration of ferromagnetism in non-magnetic modifications remains a relatively underexplored area. TiO2, commonly used as a semiconductor in numerous applications, is typically non-magnetic. However, recent studies have shown that certain forms of TiO2 can exhibit ferromagnetism. Since ferromagnetism has been observed in several Ti4+-disordered modifications, understanding the mechanisms behind ferromagnetism in TiO2 is of both theoretical and practical significance. This study investigates the Ti4+-induced ferromagnetism (TDIM) in TiO2 anatase. To examine TDIM in TiO2, we synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with a controlled distribution using a sol-gel technique, exploring three distinct synthesis methods to manipulate the level of Ti4+ disorder.",

Assuming a population of IMSs with a logarithmic distribution in mass, we can derive lower limits on the radii of the potential host stars. \n\nFor instance, at a distance of 15 parsecs, we can constrain the radius of the host star to approximately 4.2 R⊕ for a 1.4 M⊕ S2 IMS and 6.3 R⊕ for a 1.4 M⊕ S2 IMS. By assuming a logarithmic distribution of IMSs, we can use these constraints to establish upper limits on the number of planets with radii of R⊕ orbiting intermediate mass stars. \n\nWe also searched for signals from systems with equal mass companions, which can provide insights into the properties of the companion stars and their evolutionary history. We discuss the implications of these results for the stellar population problem and the potential for planets around intermediate mass stars, highlighting how these findings can enhance our understanding of stellar evolution and the dynamics of companion stars.",

They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces. We conclude that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may have an important impact on astrophysical jets, which makes it an important area for future study. The resonant coupling discussed here could also be important in microquasars, the envirnment of black hole systems like SS 433, where a pair of stars orbiting each other eject high-energy jets. The stars are in nearly circular orbits, but the jets are highly relativistic and tend to ejection in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. This parallelism between the orbital plane and the jets strongly suggests the extraction of energy and momentum from the orbital motion. The extraction of energy and momentum from a shearing relativistic flow may provide a new mechanism for this parallelism. Resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetos",

        "rewrite_text": "Astrophysical jets are highly collimated outflows produced by various astronomical phenomena, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. They play a crucial role in how galaxies and other cosmic structures acquire energy and matter. The mechanisms behind these astrophysical jets are complex, and while theoretical models have been proposed, they vary significantly. One hypothesis suggests that magnetic fields are instrumental in generating and collimating these jets. In this study, we explore the resonant interaction between the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic flow, focusing on the astrophysical systems where this interaction occurs. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics. We find that in these systems, the resonant conditions can lead to the transfer of energy from the flow to the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity, we consider a system consisting of a sheared flow with a Lorentz factor in a neutral medium, subjected to a magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We identify the modes that arise when the propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave matches the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The dominant mode exhibits a short wavelength in the y-direction and a zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of this dominant mode is proportional to the square of the vorticity in the y-direction, indicating that it is most significant in differentially rotating systems. However, the growth also depends on the ratio of the flow speed to the sound speed, γShc, suggesting that as this ratio increases, the growth rate becomes more pronounced. We also examine the stability of this dominant mode against non-linear perturbations. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly, resulting in the formation of a shock wave with smooth contact discontinuities. We conclude that the resonant interaction between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves has significant implications for astrophysical jets, making it a compelling area for further research. The resonant phenomena discussed here may also be relevant in microquasars and the environments of black hole systems like SS 433, where jets of matter are ejected from orbiting structures. The dynamics are influenced by relativistic effects and the ejection processes occur in a manner that aligns with the plane of the system. This relationship between the flow and the surrounding environment highlights the intricate connections between the dynamics of jets and the underlying astrophysical processes.",

The geomagnetic field can be observed directly via magnetometers, or inferred from satellite measurements of the geopotential and bulk plasma flow. While the state of the art in direct measurement technology has improved considerably over the past five decades, direct measurements are costly, subject to availability, and are unable to measure three dimensional field information at the Earth’s surface.

The geomagnetic field can be measured directly using magnetometers or inferred from satellite observations of geopotential and bulk flow.

The application of variational assimilation to magnetic field data presents a promising avenue for enhancing geophysical models and, ultimately, deepening our understanding of the dynamo processes that generate the Earth's magnetic field.",

Traditional QKD systems that rely on semiconductor detectors are susceptible to background noise, which can lead to errors due to interference from scintillators within the detectors. In contrast, the SSPDs employed in this system do not produce excess noise at room temperature, allowing for improved bit rates and key generation despite the presence of background noise. The system achieves a key generation rate of approximately 1 Mbit/s over a channel with 40 dB of loss, while maintaining genuine security against various types of noise and accidental coincidences. These advancements represent the first high-speed, low-loss QKD system using SSPDs, demonstrating the potential of this technology for future low-cost quantum networks. The integration of SSPDs into QKD necessitates the development of systems with high-performance components and efficient key generation capabilities, even in the presence of significant noise. As a result, this QKD system successfully generates keys at around 1 Mbit/s over a continuously lossy channel of 40 dB.

This theory is applied to analyze the mechanics of a short DNA strand with two rigid obstacles positioned at either end. The modified results indicate that the new model can accurately describe the flexibility of DNA without needing to consider the volume of the segments.

        "original_text": "Several models have been proposed in the last decades to explain the smallness of the three active neutrino mass-squared differences compared to the grand unification scale, called problem of the floppy masses. One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.

        "rewrite_text": "Numerous models have been proposed in recent years to address the issue of the small mass differences among the three active neutrino states, a phenomenon often referred to as the \"flavor problem.\" One such model is based on the seesaw mechanism, which connects the Grand Unification Theory (GUT) scale to the remarkably small masses of the Standard Model (SM) neutrinos. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the modified seesaw mechanism that incorporates additional symmetry components. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We demonstrate that within this class of models, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can possess a very large mass, potentially exceeding the TeV scale. This suggests the possibility of detecting this neutrino at a collider operating in the GeV-TeV range, making the model testable in the near future. We explore the realistic parameters of this model class in relation to both normal and inverted neutrino hierarchies. The deviation from unitarity in the first row of the PMNS matrix is utilized to explain the normal hierarchy, while the non-zero entries in the matrix help define the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested through measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contributions to the magnetic moment from the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest sterile neutrino, establishing an upper bound on their masses based on the lightest neutrino mass. This model exemplifies an unbalanced seesaw scenario, where the conservation of certain symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very light states. Additionally, this model has other intriguing phenomenological implications, including the potential existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this framework can account for the observed enhancement of Higgs decay to a pair of muons, which was reported as an excess at the Moriond EW conference. Massive and massless neutrinos have been proposed in various models to explain solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, with experimental evidence supporting these oscillations reinforcing the need for modified models and cosmological considerations. The standard approach to explaining these oscillations involves the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for quarks, the Dirac mass of neutrinos, and the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) framework for electroweak interactions. Collectively, these three frameworks are known as the Standard Model (SM) of neutrinos, which currently assumes zero mass for the neutrinos. Oscillation experiments have confirmed that at least two of these neutrinos must have non-zero masses. However, cosmological observations related to the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) suggest that at least two of these neutrinos should be relatively light. These observations highlight the ongoing challenges associated with understanding neutrino masses.",

Such studies are of particular relevance to characterize the Degree of Chaos /thermalization achieved in these collisions. Our results are based on analyzing 1.7 million minimum-bias events from the PHOBOS experiment. We compare charged and neutral particle spectra, elliptic flow, and high transverse momentum particle production, covering a range of 15% centrality covering the most central to the most peripheral Au+Au collisions. We observe that particle production at forward rapidity is very well described by a quadratic function of the number of N-particles per unit of rapidity, where N=charged or neutral. These results are compared to hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), calculations from lattice QCD, and models from weakly coupled physics. Our data show the most detailed and strongest constraints on these models, and indicate the importance of specific aspects of the dynamics of these collisions to different aspects of the observed particle spectra. We quantify these aspects using a thermal-based model. This allows us to derive the thermal parameters for the system at the chemical and kinetic freezeouts.

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision.

        "rewrite_text": "In hierarchical multiplanet systems, tidal forces exerted by distant planets can lead to a reduction in their modified semi-major axes and trigger type II catastrophic mergers. In systems with less extreme outer planets, tidal interactions can not only decrease the semi-major axes of these planets but also dampen their orbits. This study demonstrates that if the innermost planet possesses a non-zero eccentricity, the tides raised on it can induce oscillations in eccentricity that push it beyond the dynamically stable upper limit, resulting in smaller orbits. We conduct N-body simulations to validate this analytical framework and explore the implications for the orbits of non-resonant planets in multiple-planet systems. Our findings suggest that this mechanism could help explain the proximity of Earth and Mars to the Sun and may have played a role in the accretion of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term dynamics of hierarchical multiplanet systems are significantly influenced by the orbital orientations and spin axes of the planets. If the spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state, where the forced eccentricities of the planets diminish while their angular momenta remain coupled. Conversely, if the planets' spins are coplanar with their orbits, they can experience a Kozai mechanism, where the forced eccentricities oscillate in conjunction with a cycle of eccentricity-raising nodal precession. During this process, the semi-major axes of the planets can shrink dramatically, leading to either type I or type II migration depending on the characteristics of the neighboring planets. We find that incorporating a test particle in apsidal precession significantly alters the Kozai dynamics before the apsides align. Planetary systems that experience the Kozai effect and undergo migration exhibit changes in their semi-major axes that are more pronounced than those observed in the Solar System. Our analysis indicates that if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently small non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai mechanism can elevate eccentricities beyond the dynamically stable upper limit, driving the system into a more compact configuration. We validate this analytical approach through N-body simulations and propose that this mechanism may account for the proximity of Earth and Mars to the Sun in our Solar System. Additionally, we demonstrate that the accretion of planetesimals into Earth and Venus is facilitated when the planets are in highly eccentric orbits, suggesting that this process could have contributed to the formation of Earth and Venus.

Disordering transitions occur when a solid mixture transitions from a solid-like state to a liquid-like state, and peak effect is a phenomenon which occurs when the volume fraction of a solid mixture at the peaks of the density profile is greater than the average volume fraction of the mixture. These phenomena have both been observed in a wide range of material systems, including glass forming liquids, granular materials, and heterogeneous mixtures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect can be manipulated by altering the variance of the particle size distribution. We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations to model a binary mixture composed of particles with the same size but with different levels of variance. Through the use of radial distribution functions, we are able to demonstrate that disordering transitions and peak effect occur at lower volume fractions for systems with larger variances. Additionally, we observe an increased frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect as the variance of the particle size distribution increases, and we identify an approximate scaling relationship between these two quantities. We provide a physical argument for this scaling relationship based on the average interparticle force, and compare our results with prior works which have explored similar relationships.

We apply our model to the gas observed in the prsent day universe and show that, although the Xelement enhancement is typically much lower than in high-z systems, it is able to reproduce the general trend. Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement depends strongly on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. We apply our model to a broad range of spectra and show that different spectra lead to Xelement enhancements at the level of $10^{-3} - 1$ solar values at $z = 0$ for different metallicities at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This wide range of possible enhancements highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe. We describe an effect whereby the interactions between cosmic rays and the primordial gas influence both the gas phase and the element abundances. This has important implications for the potentiality of the gas to form structures and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time. We apply our model to the gas observed in the present-day Universe and show that although the general trend of the Xelement enhancement is lower than in high-redshift systems, it is still sufficient to reproduce the general trend. We also show that the evolution of the enhancement strongly depends on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. Our work highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe and the need to obtain a better understanding of processes occurring at low energies, such as the interaction between cosmic rays and the gas in the early universe. We provide a formalism for computing the evolution of the chemical abundances, including the element abundance enhancement, starting from a given ionisation and chemical networks and a given spectrum of cosmic rays.

        "rewrite_text": "Cosmic phenomena have astounded researchers with their ability to generate gas that produces a variety of vertex products. In this discussion, we demonstrate that these phenomena also alter the elemental composition of the gas. We apply our model to the gas present in the current rainy epoch and reveal that, although the enhancement of X-elements occurs at a much earlier stage than in high-redshift systems, it is sufficient to align with the Minneapolis trend. Furthermore, we illustrate that the degree of enhancement is significantly influenced by the characteristics of the cosmic background spectrum at different levels. By applying our model to a range of spectra, we find that varying spectra result in X-element enhancements between $10^{-3}$ and $1$ solar values at $z = 0$, depending on metallicity, which is at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This projection of diverse enhancements underscores the importance of experimental observations of the universe's components. We propose a framework in which the interactions between cosmic phenomena and primordial gas affect both the gas's properties and elemental abundances. This has significant implications for the gas's ability to form structures and for the distribution of heavy elements. Our model is applied to the gas in the low-redshift universe, revealing that while the overall trend of X-element enhancement is less pronounced than in high-redshift systems, it is still adequate to support the Minneapolis trend. We also demonstrate that the level of enhancement is heavily dependent on the characteristics of the cosmic background spectrum at various stages. Our findings emphasize the necessity for experimental investigations into the universe's evolution and the importance of understanding interactions occurring at high energies, such as those between cosmic phenomena and gas in different environments. We have developed a formalism to analyze the diverse elemental abundances, including the enhancement of elements, starting from a framework of ionization and network interactions, along with a spectrum of cosmic phenomena. The results of our calculations are consistent and can be integrated back into the ionization and network models. The networks must be defined based on twelve essential reactions required to synthesize the necessary molecules from a fraction of the initial components and a range of elements (B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po). The characteristics of these networks can significantly influence the cooling and heating processes of the gas, its evolution, and further enrichment. The effects described in this study are not limited to the reionization epoch but extend to any phase of the gas's evolution until it is altered by various cosmic influences. We have also made Python notebooks available for further exploration of these concepts.",

During fluidization, the average grain velocity increases with depth and the flux of grains through the upper surface decreases with depth in a way consistent with the Beverloo Law. However, the flux of grains passing through the lower surface does not exhibit this inverse relationship and increases with depth.

Wang Feng, Yongchao Sun, Ping Ouyang, Xiaoping Chen, Jiaxiang Song Fluidization of a Vertically Oscillated Shallow Granular Layer The motion and characteristics of particles play a central role in many important engineering and industrial processes. An especially important process is the fluidization of granular materials, which has wide applications in the mining, metallurgical, chemical and food industries1,2,3,4,5,6. Particles in a fluidized granular layer are influenced by several fundamental factors, such as the total volume fraction, the shape and size of particles, the distribution of the particles in the fluidized bed, the energy input to the fluidized granular layer, etc. All these factors affect the fluidization characteristics of the granular layer. In this work, a vertically oscillated shallow granular layer fluidizes. During fluidization, the average grain velocity increases with depth and the flux of grains through the upper surface decreases with depth in a way consistent with the Beverloo Law. However, the flux of grains passing through the lower surface does not exhibit this inverse relationship and increases with depth. These results indicate that there is a depth-dependent tri-layer structure of the fluidized granular layer, with the top surface being the shallow layer, the middle layer fluidizing like the Beverloo Law, and the bottom surface not fluidizing at all. This tri-layer structure is similar to the sandpile dynamics observed in self-organized critical systems, except that the bottom surface is not consumed. Fig. 1.

These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

These stars are believed to have formed after the matter in their host environment had expanded and cooled enough for the main processes of their constituent elements to occur. BS stars are characterized as helium-3 burning objects that have converted all of their hydrogen and helium into helium-3. A notable aspect of these stars is that they are predominantly composed of helium, with over 90% of their mass derived from helium rather than hydrogen. This has long posed a mystery, as the prevailing standard theory of stellar evolution suggests that such helium-rich stars should be rare, with simulations typically predicting that only 5-10% of stars would exhibit this characteristic. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the National University’s 2.3-meter telescope have provided a groundbreaking solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we identified nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient environments, all of which display strong beryllium (Be) absorption in their spectra. This absorption is absent in similar measurements of normal stars and is challenging to explain with existing theoretical models. While the abundance of Be must be very close to the half-life value to produce observable absorption, it has been established that standard stellar evolution cannot account for the observed levels of Be, and models involving accretion from a companion star are also insufficient. Our observations suggest a novel explanation: it has been proposed that blue straggler stars formed from accretion events involving material from a binary companion. As the most abundant element, Be is efficiently produced during these accretion processes, and its presence in the spectra of BS stars may indicate the manner in which these stars were formed. We propose that these accretion events may also have introduced additional elements such as Be into the mix. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and models of binary star systems. If beryllium can be synthesized in binary systems, then these systems may represent a unique site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, bridging the gap between the formation of very massive and very low-mass stars in the stellar population.",

        "original_text": "Galaxy clusters have provided key astrophysical constraints over wide wavelength ranges from the radio to the X-ray. Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve.

        "rewrite_text": "Galaxy clusters exhibit significant astrophysical properties across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, from radio to X-ray. Despite this extensive research, the intricate details of their formation remain a challenge in modern astrophysics. Traditional analytic models of cluster formation (e.g., @rs82) have largely been replaced by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04, @ds08), which have effectively predicted key observables such as cluster luminosity and mass. However, the predictions made by these simulations often fall short when compared to the observed number of clusters in the universe (e.g., @k07, @l06; see also @s07 for a review). This \"cosmic discordance problem\" has led to various hypotheses, including those involving filtering effects (e.g., @w84, @k84), cannibalism (e.g., @gm02), and the introduction of cluster progenitors (e.g., @mm01). While these astrophysical models have made significant contributions to our understanding, they have not fully addressed how clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we discovered that the mass of globular clusters in the vicinity of galaxy clusters is directly related to the cumulative mass of the clusters themselves. Contrary to previous theories suggesting that cluster mass is gradually acquired through mergers or mass accretion, we propose that if most clusters formed from the merging of smaller systems, there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and the surrounding mass. Our findings indicate that this scenario holds true, suggesting that massive clusters are less common in the universe and more likely to exhibit specific characteristics. However, our initial results were based on a limited statistical sample. In this study, we expand our analysis to a larger dataset of 22 clusters, for which we have uniformly measured kinematics and conducted a detailed examination of stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation plays a crucial role in shaping the observed characteristics of these clusters, providing a natural explanation for the observed negative correlation without requiring additional dynamical factors. Thus, we propose that stellar evaporation is a significant mechanism influencing the observed properties of galaxy clusters, which could substantially impact the overall understanding of cluster formation in cosmological simulations.",

A recently introduced variable, the partial filling factor (PFF), is used to quantify the statistical spread of these generated sequences. PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations. This corresponds to a strong spatial heterogeneity of the low-zero sequences and supports a growth mechanism of these sequences from a few deterministically produced seeds. For certain mixtures, it is found that rare event sequences happen with a non-vanishing frequency, which makes them of interest for cryptography.

        "rewrite_text": "A pair of distinct random number generators (RNGs) is utilized to create a substantial quantity of pseudo-random binary sequences with arbitrary characteristics. A newly introduced variable, the Partial Much Factor (PMF), serves to measure the statistical quality of these generated sequences. The PMF can be regarded as a successor indicator for randomness if a sequence exhibits a significant clustering of zeros. This quality aids in identifying distinct events within large datasets. In this context, the PMF is employed to assess the statistical properties of what are termed rare sequences, particularly those that exhibit a notable number of zeros. Such characteristics are crucial in cryptography, especially when a random key is used to encrypt a lengthy message, as a repetition of zeros in the key could compromise the encryption's effectiveness. The study demonstrates that the fluctuations in the generated PMF correspond to a zero-modified distribution with specific characteristics. This leads to a spatial heterogeneity in the zero sequences and supports the emergence of these patterns from a few deterministically generated seeds. For mixed sequences, it is observed that the fluctuations exhibit a persistent non-vanishing breadth, making them particularly relevant for cryptographic applications.

OFCs are highly coherent light sources that can be generated in various nonlinear optical cavities. By measuring the frequency of the reflected light from the target object, the OFC enables nanometer scale resolution and accurate measurement of optical spectra. This article describes an OFC-based calibration technique for optical spectrum analyzers. It consists of three key modules: a wavemeter based on Michelson interferometer, a tunable OFC, and an optical spectrum analyzer. The OFC is used to measure the target spectrum with high accuracy. In contrast to the typical spectrometer calibration using a commercial wavelength meter, the wavelength of OFC is directly measured rather than derived. Therefore, this technique has the same resolution but is more accurate and useful for many important applications in optical communications, ranging, and sensing. A block diagram of this OFC-based calibration technique is presented. This technique can measure the center wavelength, the bandwidth, and the intensity of the target spectrum with high precision. This makes it suitable for many important applications such as wavelength meter for optical communication networks, spectrum sensing with high resolution, and laser frequency and stability monitoring. The experimental results demonstrate that this OFC-based technique can measure center wavelength and bandwidth with a relative error less than 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.

Smooth Morse foliations with stably ergodic Reeb flow appear as transverse structures to some symplectic structures on cotangent bundles of closed manifolds. We study the stable ergodicity of the Reeb flow.

        "rewrite_text": "Stimulus and noise play crucial roles in optimizing information transmission through suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SR), particularly illustrated by the classic nonlinear SR system, the diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Optimal information transmission occurs when the input signal is modeled as white noise, characterized by a zero mean. In this context, the ideal noise has a non-zero mean, and its variance diminishes as the amplitude surpasses a certain threshold. These findings highlight the importance of maximizing the efficiency of nonlinear dynamical systems through suitable modulation techniques.\n\nIntroduction: Stochastic resonance (SR) has long been recognized as a key mechanism for information transmission in nonlinear dynamical systems, where a weak, random signal can amplify itself, enhancing noise-induced fluctuations above the signal's average amplitude. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been validated through experimental and theoretical studies over the past three decades. Recent research has shifted focus to information transmission via suprathreshold SR, where the signal exceeds a specific threshold. It has been established that the optimal signal structure for suprathreshold SR is white noise, which has a zero mean. In this study, we derive the ideal distributions of stimulus and noise for effective information transmission via suprathreshold SR, concentrating on the classic diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. In this model, the signal corresponds to the spiking activity of neurons, while the noise represents background synaptic and neuronal fluctuations. Contrary to previous findings, we discover that the optimal information-carrying signal is not white noise but possesses a non-zero mean. Additionally, the optimal noise exhibits a vanishing variance as the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, with peak information transmission performance achieved under specific conditions.\n\nMaterials and Methods: We investigate information transmission through suprathreshold SR using the diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, which describes the dynamics of neuronal voltage governed by FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics, coupled with two linearly independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. The Langevin equations for this model incorporate the amplitudes of the OU processes, Gaussian white noise terms, and a parameter representing the coupling strength. The model exhibits bistability, characterized by two stable states corresponding to the up and down phases of neuronal activity. The stable states are separated by a threshold, allowing for effective information transmission.",

The inner workings of these structures are complex and somewhat enigmatic, with their parallelism arising from the interplay between dualheaps and cache lines. While the algorithm is designed to leverage modern multicore architectures, its implementation on memory-constrained systems like GPUs remains unclear. Notably, dualheap selection is akin to a stack-based sorting method, exhibiting similarities to Quicksort in terms of requirements and performance. In fact, dualheap selection can outperform Quicksort in certain randomized scenarios, indicating that its unique characteristics extend beyond mere novelty. Both dualheap selection and Quicksort were independently developed around 2008 by researchers exploring unrelated areas. There is speculation that dualheap selection could represent a sophisticated component within a continuum of data structures, akin to heaps, tries, and chmaps. Although dualheap selection has shown promise in various contexts, it requires careful tuning to optimize its performance. Despite its potential, there has been limited research on dualheap selection, although theoretical advancements and empirical studies have been conducted. Despite its effectiveness in certain systems, dualheap selection has not yet been thoroughly validated. It remains uncertain whether the algorithm encompasses all necessary optimizations or if there are underlying issues that could lead to incorrect results. This overview aims to elucidate dualheap selection, focusing on its functionality and the rationale behind its operation. Additionally, we will explore avenues for further understanding the algorithm and its adaptability to different system architectures.",

Our results provide new insights into the nature of some magnetars, as well as offering new mechanisms for radio emission from these objects. Neutron stars are among the most exotic objects in the universe. They are leftover objects from the death of massive stars. They are as heavy as the moon but much more dense, being averages of several kilometers of matter packed into a volume of a few kilometers. Their interior, the so-called  nuclear sphere,  is rich in neutrons, almost half of the volume being comprised of neutrons held together with the strong force. This neutron matter is the most dense matter in the universe, similar in density to a large tumor on a human being. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a  deep crust,  essentially a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, and finally an outer layer of hydrogen and helium.

The evaluation of the complete Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations—typically involving a solution procedure with a computational cost proportional to the eighth power of the Reynolds number—is therefore often avoided and an alternative approach is followed, based on a closure to model the unresolved scales. One possible approach consists in introducing some modeled correlation between the fluctuations of the Reynolds-Averaged-Variable (RAV) and the instantaneous Reynolds stress. Among all the possible correlation tensors, the one ensuring the maximum Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS)equation-consistent (RA Conserving) is often chosen, see e.g.  1  for a review. This closure, however, does not take into account the fact that the fluctuations of the Reynolds stress are not fully known, and therefore the Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are not closed. In this work, we propose to model the fluctuations of the Reynolds-Averaged-Variable (RAV) via an Exponential-based solution of the Reynolds-Averaged-Variable equations, where the exponential is computed using the (analytical) matrix exponential of the (unclosed) Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. This new closure, that we call Matrix Exponential-Based Closure for the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale Stress (MEC-TS), ensures the RA Conserving property and greatly reduces the cost of the evaluation of the Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes equations at each time step, at the same time accounting for the unresolved contributions in the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale (TSGS) model.",

The use of the complete Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations provides a solution, but it comes with significant computational costs, particularly as the Reynolds number decreases. As a result, alternative approaches are recommended to model the unresolved aspects of these flows. One such approach involves establishing a correlation between the fluctuations of the Reynolds-Averaged Variable (RAV) and the instantaneous Reynolds stress. Among various correlation tensors, the one that is most consistent with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is selected for its robustness. However, this method does not fully account for the fact that the fluctuations in Reynolds stress are not entirely captured, leading to an incomplete closure of the RANS equations. To address this, we propose modeling the fluctuations of the RAV using an exponential solution derived from the RAV equations, where the exponential is calculated using the matrix exponential of the unclosed RANS equations. This approach, termed Matrix Exponential Closure for Turbulent Subgrid-Scale Stress (MEC-TS), preserves the Reynolds-Averaged Conserving property and significantly reduces the computational burden of solving the RANS equations while still accounting for the unresolved contributions in the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale (TSGS) model.",

These variations were applied to both dielectric/dielectric and dielectric/conductive multilayer configurations to explore the acceptable parameter ranges for electromagnetic and tunneling barriers. For each modified structure, we found that transmission, dispersion (wavelength dependence), and density of states are inversely related to the fourth power of the modified height concerning the wavelength. By adjusting these parameters for the barriers, we determined that it is not feasible to create a stepwise structure that transmits less than 10^-8, disperses less than 10^-9, or has a density of states lower than approximately 10^-4 states/eV/nm²/Ci. Similarly, it is impossible to design an electromagnetic barrier with a refractive index difference between the layers less than about 5.8×10^-3 for tunneling barriers and less than 2.2×10^-2 for barriers with less than 90% transmittance. These findings can aid in optimizing electromagnetic and tunneling barrier designs and in developing practical applications for these technologies.",

The mechanism of DNA hashing is similar to that of cryptographic one-time pad (OTP) schemes, as it incorporates a salt into the hash process to defend against offline attacks. Additionally, like OTP schemes, DNA hashing allows for the generation of hints without revealing passwords, since the generated hashes cannot be reused to derive the original values. However, unlike traditional cryptographic OTP schemes, DNA hashing can efficiently produce short, distinctive hash values from long, variable-length nucleotide sequences, significantly reducing both storage and computational requirements. DNA hashing also meets various other criteria, such as being suitable for the hardware constraints of embedded systems, being compatible with different architectures, and being adaptable to various algorithmic frameworks.

According to the principles of general relativity, the universe should be expanding at a decreasing rate, but observations indicate that it is accelerating, suggesting the influence of this mysterious force. Galaxy rotation curves have shown discrepancies that imply the existence of dark matter, which interacts with ordinary matter to create the effects attributed to dark energy. Dark matter is estimated to make up about 26% of the universe's total energy. It appears that dark energy and dark matter only become significant on large scales, which raises questions about the role of dark matter in galactic formation and behavior. This framework aligns with modified gravity theories, which propose that the effects of dark energy are weaker on smaller scales but differ significantly on larger ones.

In particular, this implies that the Kolmogorov complexity of the pseudospectrum may not be efficiently computable. For systems whose phase space is either the torus or the cylinder, explicit formulas are obtained for the pseudospectrum.

The behavior of these quantum fields underpins all interactions we observe. In the context of particle physics, their exchanges contribute to the stability of the Standard Model (SM), influencing the properties of particles and the nature of interactions. If we extend the spectrum of the SM to lower energy scales, we anticipate that these exchanges may involve gravitons, which could account for gravitational interactions, as well as potentially photons and fermions. In this discussion, we focus on the first possibility. Gravitons are theorized to be the carriers of gravitational interactions, which are typically mediated by intermediate particles. Photons and fermions are the two most prominent particles in the SM, suggesting they could also serve as force carriers. However, since they are spin-1/2 fermions rather than spin-2 bosons, they have not been considered viable candidates for this role. In this context, we propose a mechanism for photons and fermions to interact directly through a Lorentz-invariant and CPT-invariant term in the Standard Model Lagrangian. We aim to explore this proposal in current and future collider experiments. Gravitons would mediate both gravitational and Lorentz-invariant interactions, leading to observable effects in experiments, with two distinct signals emerging at invariant thresholds. In contrast, photons and fermions would only mediate gravitational interactions, resulting in different phenomenological implications. Photons and fermions can decay into gravitons, potentially leading to modified interactions.

The characteristics of this zone are influenced by factors such as the Mach number and the pre-shock magnetic field, as well as the shock propagation. In this context, we present the results of one-dimensional numerical simulations of Balmer-dominated shocks in the strong shock limit, which allow us to better understand the nature of the transition zone and calculate its physical properties as a function of the shock parameters. Our findings indicate that in the strong shock limit, the width of the transition zone corresponds to the distance between the upstream region of the pre-shock and the shock zone, while its density and dispersion vary as the square root of the pre-shock values. Additionally, we observe that the fraction of ionized particles transitions exponentially from the pre-shock value to zero across the shock front. We propose scaling relations that can be used to estimate the physical characteristics of the transition zone based on the known parameters of the flow and the shock.",

By performing state-of-the-art dust formation and evolution simulations, we find that silicate dust grains formed in the P31 ejecta can survive for a Hubble time and be injected into the surrounding early Interstellar Medium (ISM). These dust grains can then grow via accretion of metals from the presolar ISM to form nanometer-sized particles. We also find that titanium and vanadium are the most abundant elements at the grain surface and that the overall stoichiometry is roughly Ti-26V-4Si, with a high sulfur to oxygen atomic ratio of 0.5-1.5%. These sulfur-rich compositions are distinctive from those of chondritic meteorites and are most consistent with carbon-rich pebble materials, such as enstatite andagnetite, as injected dust precursors. We conclude that the P31 supernova remnant, as observed and modeled here, provides a rich platform to test theoretical predictions of dust formation and subsequent evolution. The bulk compositions of silicate dust grains injected into the early ISM can serve as fingerprints to help identify these unique grains among the Galactic and extragalactic background population.

The recent detection of an unusually large sulfur mass fraction in the wake of SN1987A supports an age estimate of ~30 million years, given that most of the injected sulfur would have likely been consumed in the formation of new dust grains.

This is possible due to the recent development of a scheme for the determination of interfacial quantities from computer simulation of only the solute particle system. This approach is based on constructing interfaces in the simulation box that match a geometrical definition of interfacial surface, and monitoring various interfacial properties, such as average position and orientation of solute particles as a function of simulation configuration. In this way we are able to measure the interfacial tensions between two coexisting phases of tangent hard sphere chains (THC), a model system used extensively to test methods for computational interfacial studies. We find that the interfacial tensions between coexisting liquid and vapor phases and between liquid and solid phases are all positive and of similar magnitude (ca. 27 mN/m), in contrast to the typical situation in liquid-vapor and oil-water systems (ca. 40 mN/m), and hence more representative of real liquids.

Due to their relatively large size and high degree of stiffness, bottlebrush polymers are often unable to adapt to the irregularities in their embedding environments, and consequently exhibit inadequate processability and function in solution or the solid state. The problem of stiffness can be mitigated by incorporating chemically crosslinkable side chains on the bottlebrush, thereby allowing the brush segments to be crosslinked once for a global change in the stiffness of the brush. However, the brush and crosslinker segments then come into close proximity, and in the absence of specific non-covalent interactions, may undergo crosslinking, even at low degrees of conversion.

Date: 2023 Author: Yosuke Kimura Title: Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stationary, spherically symmetric black hole in de Sitter space with a constant positive curvature. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Hawking radiation and the Bunch-Davies vacuum, and find that the de Sitter horizon is a effective change of the vacuum. We also consider the small mass case, and calculate the particle creation rate and the energy flux near the horizon. We find that the energy flux becomes a positive number even in de Sitter space, which violates the cosmic no-hair conjecture. Why do we care about Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces? The AdS/CFT correspondence, which was proposed by M. M. Roberts, V. A. Hubeny, C. Ranganathan, and E. funcatsbooks.com, relates a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to a conformal field theory in physical space-time. Since then, there have been many studies of quantum effects in AdS spaces, such as black holes and cosmological horizons. One reason to study the effects of quantum gravity in AdS spaces is to understand the higher-dimensional gravity itself from a view point of the lower-dimensional CFT. On the other hand, the cosmological constant in the universe is very tiny but non-zero. It has been suggested that quantum effects of the gravity could generate a positive cosmological constant. This means that the AdS space corresponds to an inflationary universe. Thus, studying quantum effects in AdS spaces provides a possible way to explain the very small but non-zero cosmological constant. However, the AdS spaces have a time-like curvature, and thus the physics in the boundary CFT does not have a time direction. This means that, since the Hawking radiation is a process from the past of the boundary, it does not affect the CFT. Thus, one cannot discuss the Cosmic No Hair conjecture from the AdS/CFT correspondence. The cosmic no-hair conjecture is that black holes in an expanding universe should have the same conserved quantities as the universe. So, it is desirable to study the Hawking radiation in AdS spaces in",

The AdS/CFT correspondence, proposed by M. M. Roberts, V. A. Hubeny, C. Ranganathan, and E. Functasbooks, connects a gravitational theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to a conformal field theory in a physical context. Since its introduction, there have been numerous studies on quantum phenomena in AdS spaces, including those involving black holes and cosmological horizons. One motivation for exploring quantum modifications in AdS spaces is to understand how higher-dimensional theories relate to their lower-dimensional conformal field theories. \n\nHowever, the cosmological constant in our study is very small but non-zero. It has been suggested that quantum effects in de Sitter space could influence cosmological dynamics, implying that the AdS space could transition to an inflationary phase. Therefore, investigating quantum effects in AdS spaces provides a framework to address the small but significant cosmological constant. Nevertheless, AdS spaces exhibit a negative curvature, and the corresponding CFT does not have a similar structure. Consequently, since Hawking radiation originates from the past of the black hole, it does not directly correspond to the CFT. Thus, discussing the cosmic no-hair conjecture within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence becomes problematic. The cosmic no-hair conjecture posits that black holes formed in an expanding universe should retain the same conserved quantities as the initial conditions. Therefore, it is essential to further explore Hawking radiation in AdS spaces to deepen our understanding of these concepts.",

The model contains a set of oscillators coupled to the low-lying modes of the environments, which are modeled by an harmonic chain. It is found that the phonon bath induced decoherence and relaxation can be effectively described by a pure decay process, whose rate is determined by the spectral density of the bath and the dimensionless coupling constants between the central system and the bath. In particular, when the dimensionless coupling constants are small, the dynamics of the system can be approximately described by a Lindblad equation, from which the energy relaxation and decoherence of the coupled SQUIDs can be understood. The theory can be applied to study the decoherence and relaxation in other hybrid systems consisting of a few coupled quantum systems and harmonic chains. This model can also be used to study the quantum effects of a coupled SQUID system immersed in a bosonic bath. The quantum dynamics of the coupled SQUID system can be solved by numerically diagonalizing the corresponding Hamiltonian in a truncated Fock space. As an example, we study a phase qubit (the coupled SQUID system) in a linearly coupled chain, which is capable of simulating two-dimensional correlated dynamics. Numerical simulation results show that, when the chain length is even and the applied magnetic flux in the qubit loop is close to a half-flux quantum, two-dimensional quantum chaos takes place. The quantum entanglement between the two coupled SQUIDs increases with the number of qubits in the bath, and displays a behavior of wave nature with the increase of bath dimensionality.",

        "rewrite_text": "A chain-boson model is introduced to elucidate the decoherence and dynamics of a few coupled SQUIDs interacting with phonons. This model incorporates a series of oscillators linked to the environmental modes, which are represented by harmonic oscillators. It is observed that the phonon interactions lead to decoherence and can exhibit chaotic behavior characterized by a pure decay process, with the decay rate influenced by the density of states and the dimensionless coupling constants between the system and the environment. When these dimensionless coupling constants are small, the system's dynamics can be effectively described by a Lindblad equation, allowing for the analysis of the evolution and decoherence of the coupled SQUIDs. This framework can be extended to investigate decoherence and dynamics in other hybrid systems comprising multiple coupled quantum systems and harmonic components. Additionally, the model serves as a guide for exploring the quantum dynamics of a coupled SQUID system immersed in a bosonic environment. The quantum behavior of the coupled SQUID system can be analyzed by numerically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within a truncated Fock space. For instance, we consider a phase qubit (the coupled SQUID system) in a linearly coupled configuration, which serves as a platform for simulating two-level quantum dynamics. Numerical results indicate that when the environmental interactions are strong and the applied magnetic field in the qubit loop approaches a half-quantum value, two-level quantum chaos emerges. The quantum entanglement between the two coupled SQUIDs increases with the number of qubits in the system, exhibiting wave-like behavior as the dimensionality of the system rises.",

The headers are then encoded with shorter codes, relying on imperfect knowledge of the subsequent headers.

In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced.

By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass.

These two regions, characterized by rotating magnetic fields, are referred to as magnetic cat regions. They rotate relative to each other by approximately 90 degrees over a span of four days. The interaction of these regions leads to the formation of magnetic field components that can produce solar flares. Notably, between June 14 and June 17, 2002, these regions generated two significant flares, classified as X10 and X8, which were detected through X-ray emissions from the Sun. These magnetic regions are critical, as they contain two peripheral areas of magnetic field activity, one in each hemisphere, along with two additional regions of magnetic field lines. Consequently, it is evident that these dynamic regions give rise to two areas of magnetic field activity, which are considered experimental magnetic regions. Their rotation relative to each other occurs at a rate of approximately 90 degrees every four days.",

We have monitored their eclipse timings for many years and detect different trends in their binary orbits. After combining our data with earlier results, we are able to determine an empirical relation between the binary period and the average time interval between consecutive eclipses. This allows us to determine an observational period for HP Librae of 83.86 hours and for V803 Centauri of 82.21 hours, or twice these values. The accuracy of our determination is sufficient to provide the first significant detection of the oscillation period in the binary orbit of HP Librae.

This will provide further constraints on the properties of the system and perhaps help to reveal its nature. Furthermore, by determining the binary period of V803 Centauri we will be able to confirm or rule out the possibility that this star is a fast rotator and to study its pulsations in more detail. Finally, the empirical relationship we have determined will allow other teams to more easily analyse the eclipse timing data for other AM CVn systems and to thereby further increase our understanding of these objects.

We find that for certain regions of the parameter space these two stability exponents are correlated: the faster the system tends to random-walk around its initial conditions, the smaller the corresponding island is. Conversely, in other regions these exponents are decoupled, namely the fastest possible decay of the distance between two trajectories is not necessarily associated with the largest possible Lyapunov exponent.

In this context, we analyze the identification of islands within the system to calculate both the largest Lyapunov exponent and the stability exponent for various regions of interest. The Lyapunov exponent provides an estimate of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions, while the stability exponent describes the long-term behavior of the distance between two nearby trajectories. This latter exponent, which is derived from the largest Floquet multiplier, can indicate the presence of stability islands within certain regions of the map. Our findings suggest that in specific areas, these two stability exponents are correlated: as the size of the stability islands decreases, the system tends to exhibit random behavior around its fixed points. Conversely, in other regions, these exponents can be independent, meaning that the rate of decay of the distance between two trajectories does not necessarily align with the largest Lyapunov exponent. For some regions, the relationship between these two exponents has been rigorously established. We believe this relationship holds in general, consistent with previous numerical findings.",

In the Tsallis framework, both Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy are influenced by a normalized factor known as the Tsallis index, which serves as a new measure of chaoticity. When the Tsallis index diverges, it indicates that the system is approaching the limit of weak chaos. This paper introduces an indicator of chaoticity based on the production of Tsallis entropy. In systems with a certain degree of freedom, the differential of Tsallis entropy production diverges at the threshold of weak chaos. By utilizing the Cauchy point and logarithmic components, we derive the conditions for this divergence and its implications for the system's behavior near the limit of weak chaos. The divergence of the differential of Tsallis entropy production emerges as a novel indicator of chaoticity and simultaneously serves as a measure for the rapid approach to the limit of weak chaos. Our method provides a straightforward approach to analyze the divergence of the differential of the Riemann zeta function at its zeros.

Perez arXiv.org eprint arXiv:1603.00711   physics.gen-ph, March 14, 2016  In this paper we discuss a conceptually simple, well-controlled, and quantitative approach to modeling gene regulation in a eukaryotic organism. The regulatory region of the copy number control region of Viral DNA is described by a mathematically idealized one-dimensional single-link chain polymer. Individual viral genomes occupy sites on this one-dimensional chain and exert a positional effect on the rate of transcription initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme. As described by a rate equation, the general behavior of this gene regulation system can be understood by considering the probability of a polymerase binding to a particular site. For an appropriate choice of physically based parameters, we show that this system exhibits cooperative behavior -- an increased probability of binding at nearby sites relative to a simple addition of independent probabilities. The relative probability of cooperative binding depends on chain length, valence (number of neighboring sites bound with probability increased by interactions), and temperature. We discuss implications of our observations for biological systems. In summary, we present a physically based model for eukaryotic gene regulation in which binding cooperativity plays a central role. This physical concept, which has long been of interest in other biological systems, here reveals its importance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model is distinguished from others by its clear physical basis and a quantitative description of its behavior. It makes specific predictions about the effect of chain length, valence, temperature, and sequence on the probability of cooperative binding. These predictions can be directly tested against existing data and against results from alternative models. Our model also suggests testable experimental protocols for exploring the role of cooperative binding in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our results demonstrate that cooperative binding is an important physical basis for understanding gene regulation in eukaryotic organisms and is likely to play an analogous role in other biological systems.

Perez  \narXiv.org eprint arXiv:1603.00711 physics.gen-ph, March 14, 2016  \n\nIn this paper, we explore a conceptually straightforward and quantitatively modified modeling scenario within the eukaryotic context. The regulatory region of the viral DNA's copy number variation is represented by a mathematically idealized one-dimensional polymer chain. Specific sites on this polymer influence the rate of transcription initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme. We analyze the dynamics of this system by considering the binding of polymerase to specific sites. Under certain macroscopic parameters, we demonstrate that this system exhibits cooperative behavior, where the binding of components at specific sites does not simply add up as independent probabilities. The extent of cooperative binding is influenced by factors such as the number of binding sites and their interactions. We discuss the implications of our findings for biological systems and propose a model for eukaryotic gene regulation where binding cooperativity plays a significant role. This physical concept, which has been of interest in various biological contexts, highlights its relevance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model stands out due to its clear physical foundation and detailed quantitative behavior, allowing for predictions regarding the dynamics of binding, valence, and cooperative interactions. These predictions can be empirically tested against experimental data and compared with alternative models. Furthermore, our model provides testable experimental frameworks for investigating the role of cooperative binding in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our findings suggest that cooperative binding is a fundamental physical principle for understanding gene regulation in eukaryotes and may also be significant in other biological systems.  \n\n**Source:** Richard A.

        "original_text": "In this paper, we present cosmological solutions in superstring theory with positive vacuum energy and positive spatial curvature. These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory.

Inflation, characterized by rapid expansion, is influenced by both observational data and theoretical frameworks in superstring theory. In this context, the vacuum energy is typically positive, but different mechanisms of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking can yield various energy scales. To achieve a robust inflationary model within superstring theory, it is essential to ensure that the underlying framework is consistent.\n\nWe demonstrate that a combination of compactifications, axion fields, and uplifting fields can lead to an inflationary de Sitter solution, which aligns with the requirements of superstring theory. Previous work has derived inflationary de Sitter solutions from supergravity, but our approach derives them from superstring theory, marking a significant distinction that may lead to observable differences between the two frameworks.

Consequently, observations of cosmological parameters, such as the scalar spectral index and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, could help differentiate between these scenarios.\n\nAnother notable difference lies in the energy scales predicted by proposed collider experiments.

Additionally, we must account for the stabilization of moduli and the implications for realistic cosmology. The collider signatures proposed will also need to be adjusted to reflect the characteristics of superstring theory.

        "rewrite_text": "Star Widow serves as an experimental tool for investigating various astrophysical phenomena, including tidal interactions, stellar evolution, and dynamical processes. These groups of stars are found across a wide range of environments; while some clusters are simple associations of coeval stars, others are formed through dynamical interactions that link previously unrelated stars with similar ages and chemical compositions. The diversity observed in these modified cluster systems suggests a complex underlying explanation, but obtaining observational data has been challenging due to the crowding and faintness of signals in distant regions. In this study, we utilized archived Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph data to analyze and characterize the spatial distribution of star clusters in the grand design spiral galaxy M51. The Full Catalog of Environments (FCOE) contains 122,695 candidate star clusters, identified from archival Hubble Space Telescope data using machine learning techniques trained on high-contrast imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys. We estimate the ages of the clusters based on the variation of the Brackett Jump at 2.166 microns, finding a log-normal distribution of ages with a peak at log(age/platforms) of approximately 7.6 and a standard deviation of 0.4. We also determined the velocities of the clusters through cross-correlation with a library of model spectra, revealing a Gaussian distribution with a peak velocity of approximately 265 km/s and a standard deviation of 39 km/s. Finally, we demonstrate that the clusters are distributed in two distinct regions along the major axis of M51, with over 60% located within 2.5 kpc of the galactic midplane.",

However, the mechanisms for hybrid networks, specifically those that explain exquisite households (LSE), struggle to ensure a uniform injection of exquisite (IP) across all networks, limiting their applicability.

Additionally, we demonstrate that LSIPE is nearly optimal in maximizing the minimum differentiated availability while ensuring that the same exquisite is chosen across all networks. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LSIPE mechanism. LSIPE represents a new approach to the Joan fiction election (LSE) for hybrid networks.

These universal invariants satisfy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, a calculation of the fundamental group, and the universal coefficients theorem. In this framework, the strong Novikov conjecture, which states that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are universal among degree-one cohomology classes, is equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This implies that the higher K-groups satisfy the Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, under certain hypotheses, also detect exotic elements in the stable homology of manifolds. We also establish twisted versions of these universal invariants and apply them to the Bismut intersection formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants extends to other stable homotopy theories, such as bordism and generalized cohomology. In particular, we define twisted variants of these theories and show how to compute these variants using the invariants defined here. This approach unifies the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a single universal theory of stable derived functors. In particular, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory arises as the key element in the localization process. In addition to defining this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also calculate its rationalization. This provides a powerful way to determine the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we propose a framework for studying twisted stable homotopy theories in which various structures, such as vector bundles and operators, are replaced by connective coverings and corresponding universal invariants.

        "rewrite_text": "This work explores universal invariants in higher K-theory across various platforms and signatures, illustrating their significance by analyzing higher K-skip compactifications of hyperbolic groups. These universal invariants relate to the modified components of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch theorem for topological K-theory, as well as the universal coefficients theorem. Within this framework, the Novikov conjecture—which posits that the higher signatures of a given space are universal among modified cohomology classes—becomes equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This suggests that the higher K-groups support the Hirzebruch signature theorem and, under certain conditions, also relate to the homology of manifolds. \n\nWe also introduce a twisted approach to these universal invariants and connect them to Bismut platforms, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This research extends to higher K-theory and universal invariants, linking them to other homotopy theories such as bordism and generalized cohomology. We differentiate twisted versions of these theories and demonstrate how to compute these variations using the invariants presented here. This work unifies the domains of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and homotopy theory by interpreting them as localizations of a single universal framework of functors. \n\nIn this context, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch theorem for topological K-theory serves as a crucial element in the localization process. Beyond establishing this universal framework of functors, we also explore its rationalization, which provides insights into the Tacoma homology of certain compactifications of hyperbolic groups, a topic of independent interest. Lastly, we propose a framework for studying twisted homotopy theories where structures like vector bundles and manifolds are analyzed through connective coverings and universal invariants. We outline some examples of these twisted variations and explain how to compute their universal invariants. I would like to thank David Giesen, Sean Tammar, and Robert Yager for their guidance and support. \n\nHigher K-theory, through universal invariants, captures essential features of continuous cohomology by considering all homotopy groups simultaneously. This is represented as a spectrum, or internal homology theory, which allows for a normalized complex with homology corresponding to the homotopy groups of the K-theory spectrum KU. These homotopy groups arise from the localization of a theory via coefficients, with the Hopkins-Miller theorem establishing a connection to topological cyclic homology (TC), which can be studied through universal invariants. This spectrum encapsulates a wealth of information, with the K-theory theorem characterizing it as a collection of components linked by extensions, necessitating the Elliott invariant. Additionally, the periodicity theorem and Bott periodicity isomorphism extend the classical Bott periodicity results to the pro-spectral level.",

        "original_text": "A popular supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenario is the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), in which the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) assumption is made about the initial conditions of the soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters. In this scenario, the parameters of the CMSSM are fully determined by just four input parameters: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu). Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters. The global best-fit point for the CMSSM is found for m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(mu) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(mu) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. Thus, we observe that, within the context of the CMSMS, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is very significant, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the LHC LHC phenomenological realm, with larger values of MLsp yielding a more constrained LHC phenomenology. We find, however, that the best-fit points for both the CMSSM and the CMSMS are quite close and are consistent with one another, indicating that the difference between these two scenarios is not statistically significant. The values of the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu), that are preferred by current experimental data within the context of the CMSSM are also consistent with those favored by current data in the CMSMS. Thus, we see no significant tension between these",

        "rewrite_text": "A requirements supersymmetry (SUSY) scenario is represented by the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), which incorporates minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) principles regarding the parameters associated with SUSY. In this framework, the CMSSM parameters are entirely defined by four input values: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0; the universal trilinear scalar coupling, a0; the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan β; and the Higgsino mass parameter, μ. Current experimental data, particularly the measured values of quark and lepton masses, can be utilized to estimate these CMSSM parameters. However, we demonstrate that, in addition to m0, a0, tan β, and μ, another SUSY parameter, the gluino mass, M_LSP, also plays a significant role when these experimental values are taken into account. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the CMSSM and its parameters—m0, a0, tan β, μ, and M_LSP—by fitting them to the observed properties of sparticles and the high-energy parameters, α(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit values and 1 sigma uncertainties for these parameters. The global fit results for the CMSSM yield m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan β = 5.9, μ = 1, and M_LSP = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the fit results are m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan β = 8.4, μ = -1, and M_LSP = 983 GeV. Therefore, we find that within the CMSMS context, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is noteworthy, as lower values of M_LSP greatly enhance the phenomenological scope of the LHC, with higher M_LSP values leading to more constrained LHC phenomenology. We also note that the best-fit values for both the CMSSM and CMSMS are closely aligned and consistent with each other, suggesting that the differences between these two scenarios are not statistically significant. The values of the universal scalar mass parameter, m0; the universal trilinear scalar coupling, a0; the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan β; and the Higgsino mass parameter, μ, derived from stringent experimental data within the CMSSM framework are also consistent with those obtained from the CMSMS.

Notably, since 2005, it has been observed that OO Serpentis entered a phase of heightened competitive activity, which did not require the presence of ejecta. During this period, the decretion disk expanded and eventually stabilized at a distance of 2.5 AU from the central star. In 2012, the outburst became visible again. My infrared observations indicate that the brightening is linked to the ejection of distant material and a corresponding rate of ejection during the outburst period. Through millimeter observations, I characterize the ejecta and the density variations in the surrounding medium. I propose a model for the ejection process, based on the dynamics of the decretion disk, which elucidates the relationship between the outbursts and the ejecta.",

This model is capable of generating both long-term depression (L-LTD) and long-term memory, which are also associated with L-LTP. Consequently, the model may serve as a valuable tool for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of L-LTP. \n\nThe model consists of three components: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and their interaction. The presynaptic component involves an mGluR that is activated by an increase in the concentration of a presynaptic neurotransmitter.

Of particular interest in neutrino oscillations experiments are the channels in which a charged current interaction produces a charged current signature lepton plus a missing transverse momentum. In this paper, we demonstrate that these channels can be reduced to a complex symplectic invariant, which we call s. The structure of this invariant allows us to predict the structure of the corresponding charged current neutrino interaction matrix in the Standard Model, namely the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. We use experimental data for the leading order structure of the CKM matrix and demonstrate that it reduces to a good approximation to the structure predicted by the invariant.

Fluid mechanics, in turn, is the study of fluid behavior not involving radiation or mechanical phenomena. The dynamics of a viscous fluid may be described by the hydrodynamic equations: the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of fluid mass; the fluid velocity, which is the statement of Newton s law of motion, and an appropriate velocity specification such as no flow across boundaries (no slip) or in canals (zero shear); and the conservation of momentum, which is the statement of force production due to contact friction and other sources not already included in the fluid mass equation.

The theory arose from attempts to reconcile the Ideas of Isaac Newton regarding an universal and singularly elegant theory of gravity with the correct description of the movements of the planets and stars. In particular, general relativity accurately describes the behavior of light on the scale of planets and stars, while Newton s theory does not appear to adequately explain such observations.

Fluid mechanics focuses on the behavior of fluids rather than solid components or mechanical systems. The dynamics of a viscous fluid can be described by hydrodynamic equations, which include the conservation of mass, the momentum equation reflecting Newton's laws, and appropriate boundary conditions such as no flow across surfaces (no-slip) or in channels (zero gradient). Additionally, the conservation of energy accounts for force production due to friction and other interactions within the fluid.\n\nGeneral relativity explains how gravity affects the propagation of light. It is one of the most comprehensive and successful theories of the universe, encompassing all forms of matter and energy, including electromagnetic fields and gravitational influences. It also describes the dynamics and structure of spacetime itself. General relativity evolved from Isaac Newton's universal law of gravitation, providing a more accurate framework for understanding the motion of celestial bodies and gravitational phenomena. In contrast to Newton's laws, which struggle to explain certain observations, Einstein's field equations represent a fundamental aspect of nonlinear general relativity, often lacking straightforward solutions. Consequently, Einstein proposed a hypothesis to address the complexities of gravitational interactions.",

These phenomena have been identified as key mechanisms for the generation of spin currents. We also examine theoretical models for the anomalous Hall effect based on quantum mechanics and spin drift-diffusion equations, which form the foundation for further theoretical and numerical studies in this innovative field.\n\nThe experimental findings related to anomalous Hall effects and spin rectification in thin films are reviewed, along with the role of topological effects in these phenomena. We discuss the implications of spin rectification through various mechanisms and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches in practical applications. Additionally, we explore the significance of topological phases in electron systems with spin-orbit interaction, including the topological Hall effect and its relevance to this area of research.\n\nWe also provide an overview of the Hall effect in metallic systems and examine the Hall effects in semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, and topological insulators. The role of surface states in topological insulators is discussed, along with the mechanisms for spin accumulation. Finally, we highlight the applications of bipolar spintronics, which include devices based on automated charge manipulation, exchange interaction, tunnel magnetoresistance, and spintronic logic.",

Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. It is suggested that the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation can be used as a new standard for estimating the black hole mass.

        "rewrite_text": "Massive platforms, known as \"salons,\" exist in all yacht rain systems. They accumulate over time through the accretion of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the parameters associated with the activity of black holes. This estimation relies on three factors: the class dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion, and the influence radius of the black hole. The first two parameters are typically more variable, while the third can be measured using the surrounding environment. The first two parameters are strongly correlated and can be utilized to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimations have been conducted on a large sample of galaxies, revealing that more massive black holes tend to have larger stellar velocity dispersions on average. This correlation can be expressed with a linear relationship: M_BH = A × M_spheroid + B, where M_BH represents the mass of the black hole, M_spheroid is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient approximately equal to 7, and B is a constant. This relationship holds true across various Hubble types, particularly for early-type galaxies. The correlations with the host galaxy are generally stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which may be attributed to the different growth mechanisms of black holes. The scatter in this relationship can be minimized by incorporating another observable, specifically the luminosity of the spheroid. This can be achieved by analyzing the velocity dispersion and the effective radius of influence, which are defined for the spheroid. The relationship can also be derived from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It has been observed that the scatter in the black hole mass-luminosity relationship is significantly reduced compared to other correlations, and the slope of the relationship is closer to 10, indicating more precise measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. This suggests that the black hole mass-spheroid luminosity relationship could serve as a reliable standard for estimating black hole masses. This is a preprint submitted to the Astrophysical Journal.

It is well-known that such theories can be obtained from the Lagrangian formulation of the celebrated Euler equation on the diffeomorphism group of a three dimensional Riemannian manifold. An equivalent Hamiltonian description using the theory of Lie groupoids and Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groupoids is proposed, and explicit constructions are given for some important special cases including fluid dynamics on Lie groups, Newtonian gravity on the special orthogonal group and the general linear group, and the classical ECSK theory of non-relativistic gravity. In the Hamiltonian description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics are described by a Lie groupoid, with the fluid dynamics being a particular case in which the source of the gauge groupoid morphism is the diffeomorphism group of the fluid domain. In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization. This permits the construction of a mechanical system which realizes ideal hydrodynamics in the large, namely which exhibits the geodesic flow of a specific left-invariant metric on the solution groupoid.

        "original_text": "The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is a powerful method to analyze the behavior of gravitation in systems consisting of compact objects. The first post-Newtonian approximation (1PN) of general relativity (GR) was constructed by Einstein and Rosen in 1932. Scalar-tensor theory (STT) generalizes GR by generalizing the graviton into a more general scalar field, leading to additional gravitational degrees of freedom. The most general STT action consistent with general covariance and single-scalar-fieldsymmetry is that of Horndeski. In 1981, Deffayet et al. found a novel class of scalar-tensor theories, known as scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling (STT NGC ), which differ from general STT by the form of the coupling function. To first order in the usual PN parameter ( = GM/(rc^2)), where M and r are the mass and distance of the system, respectively, and G is the Gravitational constant, the equations of motion for a two-body system in general STT NGC  differ from those of GR only by 2.5PN order, because the self-coupling of the scalar field enters at 1.5PN order. In 2015, Brax et al. showed that a special case of STT NGC  called scalar-tensor-relativistic theory (STR) is a good approximation to general STT in a large class of spherically symmetric solutions, dubbed nearly solutions. To zeroth order in the usual PN parameter, the equation of motion for a nearly spherically symmetric system in STR is fourth order and reduces to the ordinary Emden equation, whose solutions are exact scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with a finite horizon. In this Letter we consider the slow motion of particles around such black holes and compare the resulting scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Hamiltonians with the ones of GR. We find that: i) in the 1.5PN and 2PN orders, the first terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR differ from those of GR, respectively, by scalar and Gauss-Bonnet topological invariants; ii) the 1PN terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR are proportional to the square of the absolute value of the Det of the spatial metric. Henceforth, these invariants vanish for black holes in Einstein gravity. In conclusion, we have obtained the 2PN approximation of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity.",

        "rewrite_text": "The post-Newtonian (PN) framework is a leading approach for examining gravitational behavior in systems that differ from traditional objects. The first post-Newtonian approximation (1PN) of general relativity (GR) was introduced by Einstein and Rosen in 1932. Scalar-tensor theories (STT) extend GR by transforming the graviton into a more experimental scalar field, allowing for a finer distinction of degrees of freedom. The most widely accepted STT that aligns with experimental covariance and scalar field symmetry is Horndeski's theory. In 1981, Deffayet et al. discovered a new class of scalar-tensor theories, referred to as scalar-tensor-non-minimally coupled (STT NGC), which diverges from standard STT through the inclusion of additional parameters. To first order in the conventional PN parameter (ε = GM/(rc²)), where M is the mass, r is the distance of the system, and G is the gravitational constant, the equations of motion for a two-body system in general STT NGC differ from those of GR only at the 2.5PN order, as the self-coupling of the scalar field contributes at the 1.5PN order. In 2015, Brax et al. demonstrated that a specific subclass of STT NGC, known as scalar-tensor-relativistic theories (STR), provides a robust framework for analyzing STT in a broad range of spherically symmetric solutions, termed nearly solutions. At zeroth order in the PN expansion, the Hamiltonian for a spherically symmetric system in STR is fourth order and deviates from the standard Emden equations, whose solutions are scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Hamiltonians with additional terms. In this study, we examine the Hamiltonian framework around such deviations and the associated scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Hamiltonians in relation to GR. Our findings indicate that: i) at the 1.5PN and 2PN orders, the leading terms in the Hamiltonians for STR differ from those in GR due to scalar and Gauss-Bonnet topological invariants; ii) the 1PN terms in the Hamiltonians for STR are modified by the square of the determinant of the spatial metric. Consequently, these invariants vanish in the context of Einstein's gravity. Ultimately, we derive the 2PN approximation of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories.",

One key characteristic of the pion, which is the lightest hadron, is its radius. Accurately measuring this radius can enhance our understanding of the pion's quantum fluctuations and the nature of the strong interaction. In this review, I will summarize recent advancements in determining the pion's radius and discuss various experimental approaches and potential research avenues. The pion's radius, which reflects its spatial distribution, is less complex to measure compared to other hadrons. This measurement is crucial for deepening our understanding of the strong interaction and the phenomenon of confinement. Significant progress has been made in both lattice QCD simulations, where the pion is modeled on a computational grid, and in experimental efforts that focus on precise measurements of the pion's form factors. I will highlight these developments and explore future research directions in this field.",

Additionally, we applied a similar approach, modifying it to use histological data as input, and found it was also capable of differentiating between \"304 exquisite Minneapolis\" and \"fire\" conditions, using just three samples for training. This suggests that the trace distribution may contain valuable information about the processes that occurred prior to the formation of the samples. Our research demonstrates that the distribution of the largest Minneapolis samples, which can be easily identified during the manufacturing process, may hold significant information that could inform our understanding of the conditions leading to the formation of these materials.",

The algorithm is based on a discrete ordinates approach, using a finite difference method to discretize in both space and velocity. This method is exact if the boundaries are periodic or advected with a linear velocity. We show that it is also consistent if the advection speed is linearly interpolated between the cell center and the boundary. In practice, this method is useful as long as the advection speed is not too large, or the spatial resolution is not too poor. As an example of its application, we simulate the growth of solids in a viscous accretion disk. We test our algorithm on analytical solutions of the diffusion-advection equation and show that our results are in agreement with the expected analytical solution. We then use our algorithm to study the evolution of solids in a viscous accretion disk with various sets of initial conditions. In all cases, solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale. In the second part, we study the effect of solids on the dust evolution in the disk. Solids generate a size distribution that differs from that of dust grains. In particular, solids tend to generate a significant amount of sub-micron sized grains. The exact form of this size distribution depends on the size and composition of solids. In this part, we present several simple models to investigate the influence of solids on the dust evolution. We show that solids with a given size and composition produce different consequences on the dust size distribution. Finally, we show that the exact form of the size distribution is of little importance for the dust evolution in the most part of the disk: after about one million year only large grains are present in the disk and the evolution is fully determined by the dust settling and the radial drift. We conclude that solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale, but they are a major actor of the dust evolution.

        "rewrite_text": "In the initial phase of this study, we developed a tablet-based solution for the advection-diffusion equation in collaboration with a team specializing in free boundaries. The approach utilizes a discrete ordinates method, employing a finite element technique to discretize both time and space. This method proves to be accurate when the boundaries are either stationary or advected at a constant linear velocity. We demonstrate that it remains consistent even when the advection speed is linearly interpolated between the cell centers and the edges. Practically, this technique is effective as long as the advection speed is not excessively high and the spatial resolution is adequate. As a case study, we simulate the growth of solids within a viscous accretion disk. We validate our results against established solutions of the diffusion-advection equations, confirming that our findings align with the anticipated outcomes. We then apply our algorithm to investigate the behavior of solids in a viscous accretion disk with varying boundary conditions. Our results indicate that solids cannot escape the steep potential well within a ten-thousand-year timeframe. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of solids within the disk, noting that their distribution differs from that of the surrounding grains. Specifically, solids tend to produce a significant quantity of sub-micron-sized particles. The characteristics of this distribution are influenced by the conditions and properties of the solids. Furthermore, we employ simplified models to explore how solids affect the overall dynamics of the system. Our findings reveal that solids with varying properties yield different effects on the resulting particle distribution. Ultimately, we conclude that the detailed distribution of solids is not critical for the immediate dynamics within the disk; after approximately one million years, only larger grains remain, and their distribution is primarily governed by the excess mass and drift. In summary, while solids do not significantly alter the dynamics within a ten-thousand-year timeframe, they play a crucial role in shaping the overall particle distribution in the system.",

These are fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in an abrupt change of properties of a fluid, usually characterized by a supersonic flow jump. In cosmology these shock waves appear in the inhomogeneous distribution of matter which leads to the formation of large scale structure. There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the cosmological shock wave phenomenon. This is because new observational discoveries such as the 511 keV line, and highly contrasted galaxy clusters have shown the need to go beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. In the cosmological world, there is more variation in the matter density and velocity fields than what would be expected from a simple homogenous and isotropic model. It is now known that type 2 shock waves are generic features of cosmological fluid flows. Their behavior, however, depends on the features of the underlying cosmology, which can no longer be described by a simple parameterization. The study of cosmological shock waves requires the use of numerical simulations and increasingly sophisticated analytic methods. The article is organized as follows.

        "original_text": "Manganese and other rare earths are examples of impurities that may localize in the interstitial sites of the semiconductor host lattice. Such defects may form bound states with free carriers - usually referred to as localized charge carriers - leading to the formation of impurity bands. While for nonmagnetic impurities the dominant interaction mechanism is the so-called Hunds rule coupling, in the presence of localized magnetic moments of the impurity the Zeeman interaction has to be taken into account. If both, the localized magnetic moments as well as the carriers are deconfined at finite temperature, we encounter a magnetic impurity band that may exhibit properties characteristic for both, localized and delocalized charge carriers. In order to understand the nature of the impurity band we study for the case of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) the crossover from localized to delocalized charge carriers via a systematic variation of the Coulomb attraction by the acceptor. In this context the physical concept of Wannier functions is employed to describe the spatial extent and localizability of the impurity band wave functions.

These defects can create bound states with free carriers, known as localized charge carriers, which interact with impurity bands. For non-magnetic impurities, the interaction is governed by Hund's rule; however, when magnetic moments are present, the Zeeman interaction must also be considered. If both the magnetic moments and the carriers are delocalized, a magnetic impurity band can form, influencing both localized and delocalized charge carriers. To understand the nature of the impurities, we examine the behavior of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and the transition from localized to delocalized charge carriers through a systematic analysis of Coulomb attraction by acceptors. In this context, the physical concept of Wannier functions is used to describe the spatial characteristics and localizability of the impurity wave functions. The Coulomb attraction from the acceptor is modeled with a dielectric background to account for the altered behavior of charge carriers in the valence band. By comparing calculated spectral data with experimental results, we can identify the relevant parameters. Our theoretical analysis leads to the conclusion that the acceptor-limited mobilities in DMS can be expressed by the equation σ (cm²/V·s) = μ₀ (cm²/V·s) · ε₀ · N(D) · N(A), where μ₀ represents the mobility in the absence of charge carriers, N(D) is the donor density, and N(A) is the acceptor density. Thus, for a given acceptor density, the mobility of charge carriers in diluted magnetic semiconductors is primarily determined by the density of the impurities. This finding is applicable as a general property across all IV-VI compounds, which include both magnetic impurities and non-magnetic acceptors.",

It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model. Our analysis shows that the FGR cannot be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework. We also propose an alternative perspective on the quantum dynamical phase transition, and show that QDPT exists only for the classical system, and does not exist in the limit of quantum system.

Experimental validation of this prediction, using infrared (IR) photon emission rates at varying temperatures, confirmed the expected dependence only at low temperatures.

Our analysis indicates that QDPT arises from quantum mechanics due to the neglect of quantum interference effects. Using this alternative perspective, we establish that scale invariance is a crucial aspect of quantum dynamical phase transitions.

Unlike a black hole, a gravastar features a unique surface known as the \"hanging hole,\" through which matter can enter but cannot escape. Consequently, a particle within the gravitational field of a gravastar will accumulate energy while attempting to ascend through the hanging hole, but will ultimately fall back. In contrast, a particle in the gravitational field of a black hole will not experience this accumulation of energy; instead, it will be drawn into the event horizon.

This concept was introduced by Mazur and Mottola in 1994 as an alternative to black holes. Gravastars differ from black holes in that they possess a defined surface, the hanging hole, which allows matter to fall in but prevents it from escaping. Thus, a particle in the gravitational field of a gravastar will gather energy while trying to ascend through the hanging hole, but will eventually fall back. In comparison, a particle in the gravitational field of a black hole will not accumulate energy in this way; it will be pulled into the event horizon.

        "original_text": "Turbulent flows are often characterized by the assumption of locality, where the kinematics and dynamics are largely separable in space and time. In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady. This provides a useful framework for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows, and has important implications for the dynamics of clusters in highly compressible turbulent flows such as those arising in the atmosphere and fusion plasma simulations.",

        "rewrite_text": "Turbulent flows in Lyon are characterized by the intricate interplay of kinematics and dynamics, where these aspects can be separated into distinct components. In this framework, motion is analyzed by breaking it down into various modes or eddies, which are organized into coherent structures such as shear layers, vortices, and wakes. For instance, in compressible turbulence, these eddy components exhibit a hierarchical organization, with larger structures like filaments and sheets emerging from smaller eddies. This phenomenon is characterized by power-law scaling, where the properties such as velocity, density, and size of eddies at one scale relate to those at smaller scales through a universal scaling factor. This behavior, known as multiscaling, resembles a self-similar pattern and has been observed with varying degrees of rigor across different physical systems. In this context, we present numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, focusing specifically on the manifestation of multiscaling in the scaling behavior. We find that multiscaling is less pronounced compared to similar experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but it is clearly evident for certain flow conditions. We suggest that this discrepancy arises from the nature of multiscaling in compressible turbulence, where scaling behavior gradually diminishes as modes evolve under increasing Reynolds number conditions. This phenomenon, referred to as intermittency, results in a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis by developing a multifractal model, which predicts that the observed intermittency leads to a web of multiscaling as the flow transitions from laminar to unsteady. This framework provides valuable insights for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows and has significant implications for the dynamics of compressible flows in various scenarios, including those encountered in astrophysics and fusion simulations.",

        "rewrite_text": "A global Wolf-Rayet (WR) content of 12% was reported for the evacuated NGC 300, which is significantly higher than the previously estimated 7% (Schaerer & Vacca 2010). This value may be influenced by the requirements derived from the modified characteristics of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the context of advanced societies (Israel et al. 2014). However, a closer examination of the archival data suggests that the actual upper limit for the global WR content of NGC 300 is indeed 7%. Additionally, the upper limit for WR content in the U-band for the primary population is estimated to be 2.2%, in contrast to the 8.3% derived from the global Wolf-Rayet content. This apparent discrepancy may be attributed to the late-type stellar composition of the galaxy. Late-type stars exhibit different characteristics across various wavelengths, and their solar metallicity can lead to a reduced presence of Wolf-Rayet stars. In fact, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing the observed and modeled optical colors of the galaxy indicates a low probability (P < 0.001) that the two samples originate from the same population. We estimate the global WR content in the U-band for the primary population to be 1.2%, which aligns with the observed upper limit.",

Due to their degenerate cores, sdBs appear as faint objects in the visual spectrum, characterized by numerous absorption lines whose intensities gradually decrease towards the surface. With effective temperatures around 30,000 K, their spectra can be observed using ground-based telescopes. Notably, pulsations can be detected in the spectra of sdBs, which are not limited by the boundaries of traditional observations. By studying the pulsations in three sdB stars—HS 0039+4302, HS 0444+0458, and another star—we aim to enhance our understanding of their characteristics. Through high-resolution spectroscopy, we have identified pulsations in these stars, which can be categorized into two distinct groups: those exhibiting multimodal pulsation spectra and those with single-peaked spectra. The former group displays complex spectra and is likely to be non-periodic, while the latter consists of simpler pulsators with consistent characteristics. These pulsators show similar amplitudes and patterns, with variations in their configurations, including differing pulsation amplitudes and phases. We suggest that these pulsators originate from different evolutionary stages of a common progenitor. The stars with multimodal pulsation spectra may represent sdBs in the final stages of merging, leading to the onset of electron degeneracy. This study marks the first detailed analysis of pulsations in these three sdBs, revealing that they exhibit different evolutionary states from a shared ancestor. Our findings contribute to the classification of two distinct types of pulsators within the sdB population, adding three new pulsators to the small but expanding catalog of sdB pulsators.

        "original_text": "Blazars are the most powerful non-active galaxies with their relativistic jets closely aligned to our line of sight. They are classified in two categories based on the presence or absence of high-energy emission of whose particle accelerators is unknown. Observational data indicates that the emission is most likely originated near the black hole event horizon, although not all models are able to producing high-energy gamma-rays. Emission mechanisms in blazars are uncertain. A popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek process in which the magnetized central black hole powers the jet by extracting spin energy of the black hole.

        "rewrite_text": "Blazars are unique astronomical objects characterized by their relativistic jets that are closely aligned with our line of sight. They can be classified into two categories based on the presence or absence of certain emissions, the origins of which remain uncertain. Observational data suggest that the emissions primarily originate near the event horizon of supermassive black holes, although not all models account for the observed gamma-ray emissions. The mechanisms behind blazar emissions are still not fully understood. One prominent model is the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which posits that a magnetized rotating black hole powers the jets by extracting energy from the black hole's magnetic field. This model was initially developed for weak stellar magnetic fields, but recent studies indicate that the magnetic fields in blazars may be significantly stronger. Another model, known as synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), describes how synchrotron radiation is up-scattered by the blazar's own photons to produce gamma-ray emissions. Blazars exhibit variability across all wavelengths on very short timescales, ranging from hours to days. They are known to emit radio waves, as well as gamma rays, and these emissions are highly variable. In this context, we demonstrate that blazar emissions are closely linked to the inner regions of their accretion disks. Jets are thought to originate from these small-scale inner regions, and a correlation has been observed between the height of the accretion disk and the properties of the jets. Such a correlation aligns with predictions from the Blandford-Znajek model and is consistent with current observational data.

        "rewrite_text": "Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are highly magnetized neutron stars. Binary MSPs, on the other hand, exist in close orbits with companion stars, and some of these systems emit radio waves due to interactions between the pulsar and its companion, often involving processes like accretion disk ablation. In contrast, solitary MSPs are generally less interesting and have been identified in approximately half of the transient gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). These systems, which lack companions, are expected to be radio silent. In this study, we present the detection of PSR J1453+1902, a solitary MSP previously observed only at 1400 MHz. We have obtained a 1.4 GHz upper limit on its radio emission that is significantly lower than the average for other binary MSPs. This detection was made using the Large Sky Area Multi-band Transit Satellite (LSAM). We compare the upper limit on the radio luminosity of PSR J1453+1902 with the distribution of radio luminosities for binary MSPs and find it to be a notable low-luminosity outlier. Therefore, we propose that PSR J1453+1902 is the first solitary MSP identified in connection with a transient GRB.",

It consists of an ensemble of non-interacting vortices, with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well-defined packets of each vortex sign. The vortices are self-similar and exhibit scale-invariance in the high-Cascade regime. In this paper, we develop a simplified 2D dynamical model that captures the essential features of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of the vorticity, Omega, is modeled by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Dissipation of enstrophy arises primarily through two distinct processes: direct viscosity, which leads to local smoothing of the vorticity field, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from near-core vortical zones to outer regions. We demonstrate that these two processes lead to a scaling solution with time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, in agreement with the dynamical model. We then show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is controlled by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions. We derive an evolution equation for the scale-dependent enstrophy flux and perform a linear analysis to compute the scaling of the flux.

In this context, we anticipate finding kinematic signatures indicative of major or modified minor mergers associated with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify three such cases. Our spatially resolved color data indicate that both the SDGs and their GCs exhibit intermediate to slow stellar velocities, with the velocities increasing with distance from the center of the galaxies. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more concentrated than that of the host galaxies, and the GC systems have truncation radii (the average projected distance within which half of the GCs are located) and density profiles consistent with predictions from both major and minor merger scenarios. We conclude that either a significant major merger or a purely minor merger has likely occurred within the truncation radii of at least five of the studied galaxies.",

The angular size of the shockwave is 0.5 milli-arcseconds, and the blast wave is radiating at a rate of 10^53 ergs per second. These findings have significantly enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of the supernova shockwave and the interactions between the ejecta and the shockwave at the moment of the explosion. Supernova 1987A is classified as a Type II supernova. Early spectra revealed differences in the hydrogen and helium nuclei. As the ejecta expanded, the spectra evolved to show features from stripped nucleons. (In Type II supernovae, the core does not collapse into a neutron star.) Eventually, the spectral features became more uniform, indicating the evolution of the ejecta. Supernova 1987A was remarkable because it occurred within 50 parsecs of the Sun and was one of the closest supernovae observed in modern times. This proximity allowed for detailed studies of shockwave propagation and genuine emissions. The blast wave reached the vicinity of Earth in under 20,000 years, which is the time it took for the light from the explosion to reach us.

Industrialization emerges within a system where diseconomies are prevalent, yet centralization occurs when innovations lead to enhancements in efficiency. Increasing returns can promote centralization, as exemplified by the Industrial Revolution, which was characterized by innovative advancements in machinery and factory production, despite the presence of diverse components. At the same time, emerging differentiated platforms contributed to increasing returns in various sectors, including transportation, logistics, and management. These components of increasing returns are influenced by granular heterogeneities; for instance, in the transportation sector, shorter platforms and extensive road networks have led to increased returns. Such heterogeneities evolve alongside innovations, as improvements in technology and production processes enhance overall efficiency. These interactions can result in varying outcomes. When applying these concepts to historical contexts, it is evident that the Industrial Revolution began in Europe, marked by significant advancements in technology and production methods, which transformed the landscape of machinery and factory operations. Conversely, emerging economies often experience growth through innovations that may be specific to their context but have broader applicability. While these economies may experience increasing returns, they can also lead to systemic challenges. This dynamic helps explain the difficulties faced by established economic sectors.

Using either parametric (e.g., accretion disk spectrum from Cambridge Accretion Code) or non-parametric (e.g., cubic spline) models for the disc emission, one can independently estimate the apparent radius of the emission region as a function of the gravitational potential of the black hole. We demonstrate that, for a given black hole mass and distance, the estimated Eddington ratios and the temperature of the MBB continuum are very sensitive to the assumed spectral shape. Using a spherical model (e.g., relativistic disk inverse Compton scattering) and assuming a high-spin black hole ($a$=0.95) with a mass of 1.4 M⊙ for the object ESO243-49 HLX, we show that the estimated Eddington ratio would be decreased by a factor of two if the spectrum is a MBB rather than a disk+BB spectrum, or by a factor of five if the spectrum is a disk+BB spectrum with an apparent temperature of kT = 0.15 keV instead of 0.6 keV. We also show that for the same black hole mass and spectrum, the estimated temperature of the MBB continuum is very different if the spectrum is a MBB with kT = 0.15 keV instead of a disk+BB spectrum with kT = 0.6 keV. These differences have implications on how ULXs with the same near-infrared emission are separated into those whose appearance is dominated by a high-spin black hole or by an advection-dominated accretion flow, respectively.

By employing either parametric models (such as the accretion disk spectrum from the Cambridge Accretion Code) or non-parametric models (like cubic splines) for the emitted radiation, we can independently estimate the characteristics of the emission region as a function of the black hole's properties. Our findings indicate that, for a given black hole mass and distance, the Eddington ratios and the parameters of the MBB continuum are highly sensitive to the assumed spectral shape. For instance, using a spherical model (e.g., relativistic disk inverse Compton scattering) and assuming a high-spin black hole (with a spin parameter of $a = 0.95$) and a mass of 1.4 solar masses for the object ESO243-49 HLX, we demonstrate that the estimated Eddington ratio would be halved if the spectrum is modeled as an MBB instead of a disk plus blackbody spectrum. Furthermore, it would decrease by a factor of five if the disk plus blackbody spectrum has an apparent temperature of kT = 0.15 keV instead of 0.6 keV. We also illustrate that for the same black hole mass and spectrum, the characteristics of the MBB continuum differ significantly between a spectrum with kT = 0.15 keV and one with kT = 0.6 keV. These variations have important implications for distinguishing ULXs with similar near-infrared emissions, particularly in determining whether their emissions are dominated by a scenario involving a stellar-mass black hole or by an advection-dominated accretion flow. We discuss the consequences for the interpretation of ULX spectra and propose observational tests that could help differentiate between various models of ULX continuum emission.",

The 21-cm emission and absorption signals provide insights into the neutral state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and are influenced by the density field and the dynamics of structure formation. Early signs of cosmic reionization are observable as distinct features in the large-scale 21-cm signals. Correlated Random Walks (CRWs) offer a statistical method to extract small-scale information from these large-scale signals. In this context, we examine the effects of differential bias and non-linear dynamics on CRW statistics. We analyzed CRW signals from N-body simulations of cosmic reionization and found that the CRW signal is maximized for significant bias at the large-scale level. By applying the CRW framework to observations from the Global Epoch of Reionization Array (GLOBE), we achieved a measurement of the differential bias with an uncertainty of up to 3.7% (1 sigma). Additionally, we demonstrate that the large-scale bias does not affect the intrinsic bias (calculated from N-body simulations) and that observations at higher scales can further constrain this bias.",

To this end, this paper proposes a non-Bayesian rate adaptation with two design approaches: one is the restless multi-armed bandit based approach for finding the unavailable spectrum in an automated and adaptive manner; the other is the Lyapunov optimization based approach for finding the operating point that achieves the worst average interference to the primary user. Specifically, the former adopts a large number of discrete channel states to approximate the dynamic and continuous interference levels, while the latter adapts the transmitting rate from a static to a dynamic mode according to the observation of the interference, and gradually converges to the operating point that achieves the worst average interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve near-optimal performance, in terms of both effective spectrum utilization and average interference to the primary user.",

To prevent interference with primary spectrum users, cognitive radio systems must implement strategies to manage their transmission rates based on the interference levels experienced by these primary users, which can be unpredictable and variable. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Oliver-Bayesian rate optimization framework with two distinct approaches: the first is a restless multi-armed bandit algorithm designed to automatically and adaptively identify available spectrum; the second is a Lyapunov optimization technique aimed at determining the optimal operating point that minimizes average interference to the primary user.

The component at 66.5 K is located in a spiral arm of the Milky Way and is identified as an anomalous Extremely Red Object.

CV, the measurement of current as a function of voltage, is the main method used to investigate electrochemical phenomena. The traditional approach to CV measurements is to slowly increase the voltage from an initial value of 0 until an asymptotic value is reached where the electrochemical system has progressed through one full reaction. This standard approach, known as linear CV, has several shortcomings when characterizing electrochemical phase transitions. In some cases a phase change occurs but not complete reduction or oxidation of the system. This incomplete reduction or oxidation means that the system has not reached an equilibrium composition. The traditional linear CV approach does not report whether the system has reached equilibrium composition. Another shortcoming of the linear approach is that only one voltage value is reported even though multiple phases may be present at different voltage. This work develops a new approach to CV measurement, called E-C FORC, which tracks the voltage path the system takes as it progresses through multiple phases and reaches equilibrium. Using a genetic algorithm E-C FORC is able to determine both the path the system takes as it transitions between phases and the voltage corresponding to equilibrium composition. The technique is demonstrated using ferricyanide as a model electrochemical system. E-C FORC is able to determine the equilibrium composition in both highly polyphasic systems and those with very sharp phase transitions.

        "rewrite_text": "This modification introduces a novel cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique for characterizing electrochemical systems and predicting equilibrium states. CV, which measures current as a function of voltage, is the primary method for investigating electrochemical properties. Traditionally, CV involves incrementally increasing the voltage from an initial value of 0 until an asymptotic value is reached, indicating that the electrochemical system has undergone a complete cycle. This standard approach, often referred to as linear CV, has limitations when it comes to characterizing complex electrochemical systems. In some cases, the system may exhibit changes in current without achieving complete reduction or oxidation, indicating that equilibrium has not been attained. Furthermore, traditional CV methods do not provide information on whether the system has reached an equilibrium state. Another drawback is that only a single voltage value is reported, despite the fact that different phases may occur at varying voltages. \n\nTo address these issues, we have developed a new CV measurement technique called E-C FORC, which tracks the voltage trajectory of the system as it transitions through different phases and approaches equilibrium. This innovative method allows for the simultaneous monitoring of both the path taken by the system and the voltage values associated with equilibrium states. The technique utilizes ferricyanide as a model electrochemical system. E-C FORC is designed to determine equilibrium characteristics in both multi-phase systems and those with sharp phase transitions. Additionally, E-C FORC can accommodate varying voltage requirements, enabling the differentiation of transitions.

We present a cooperative transmission protocol which leverages network coding and MUD to achieve high spectral efficiency and high diversity simultaneously.

Spectral efficiency pertains to the amount of information transmitted per platform, while diversity refers to the resilience of the system in the presence of fading. Traditionally, achieving high spectral efficiency has been pursued without necessarily enhancing diversity. However, modern networks require both improved spectral efficiency and diversity. In this context, we demonstrate that a multiuser hybrid method (MUD) can achieve both high spectral efficiency and significant diversity. We propose a cooperative transmission strategy that utilizes network coding and MUD to simultaneously enhance both spectral efficiency and diversity. Our analysis employs the concept of degrees of freedom (DoF) and presents a network coding framework for the symmetric case. Through simulations, we illustrate that the spectral efficiency and diversity attained by our proposed method significantly surpass those achieved by Network Coding with Max-Ratio Combining (MRC) and Network Coding with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC).

        "original_text": "Spherically symmetric plasmas are an important and interesting general relativistic plasma system, which arise in, for example, collapsing stars, laboratory nuclear fusion experiments, and the early universe. The simplest spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system contains two independent functions of radial coordinate only. However, these can be reduced further to a single quadrature, allowing exact solutions to be obtained in several special cases. In general, the presence of the Maxwell field contributes one additional conserved charge, the masshair  of the solution. For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime. The resulting space-times describe either black holes with a gravitational mass, a scalar field hair, or naked singularities, depending on the choice of equations of state. In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by relating the system to a theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to a non-linear scalar field. We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties. In particular, we show how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair. Our approach has some similarity to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of some strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this respect, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above may be interpreted as a phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theory, with the black hole forming when the gauge theory approaches a large-$N$ limit in which gravity is strongly interacting, and the naked singularity forming when the gauge theory undergoes a large-$N$ transition to a low-energy weakly coupled plasma. This paper provides a rare example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system.

In this context, the presence of the Maxwell field introduces a conserved charge, which corresponds to the mass of the solution.

The results indicate that these solutions can either exhibit a hair-like structure, a scalar field hair, or lead to naked singularities, depending on the chosen equations of state. \n\nIn this work, we present a systematic approach to derive analytic solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric configuration.

Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs).

We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns.

Over time, VCS 0413-647 has exhibited significant variability across all wavelengths. This paper details the findings from an extensive multi-wavelength observing campaign conducted in 2017. Optical and near-infrared data were collected using the Keck II telescope and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), while X-ray and gamma-ray observations were made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Large Array. Radio observations were performed using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the phased VLA, and the Molonglo Observatory. Our milliarcsecond-scale radio imaging study of VCS 0413-647 revealed a complex structure with an angular separation of 0.15 mas (approximately 8.6 light-years at the source's redshift of z = 0.0812) between two distinct blobs. This structure, along with variations in total flux density, polarization, and other characteristics, supports the observed variability across all wavelengths. We interpret this variability as a result of a Doppler factor, θD, influenced by the superluminal motion of the blobs at approximately 0.15c.",

Such studies are typically performed at high redshifts, using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from young stars. Because the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type of stars and their age, the SFR can be measured by fitting the FUV emission with population synthesis models.

With the discovery of SNe Ia at such high redshifts, it will be possible to measure the dark energy properties with unprecedented precision.

In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation.

In this study, we focus on the spontaneous emergence of magnetic order in the ground states of one-dimensional Heisenberg quantum antiferromagnets, particularly in parameter regimes that are challenging to explore through traditional simulations. The onset of long-range order is indicated by a sharp increase in sublattice magnetization, which approaches a saturated value. This behavior is supported by experimental coupled-cluster calculations, which suggest that long-range order can also emerge in systems lacking true long-range order under certain conditions. These findings open new avenues for experimental investigations of quantum systems and their potential applications.",

Additionally, data was collected in hard X-rays using the Gamma-Ray Burst and Afterglow Spectrometer (GRAB). The 304 and 525.0 nm emissions originate from the upper and partially ionized layers of iron. The loop displayed significant activity during the flares, with asymmetries in the emission lines suggesting that the flaring dynamics could not be adequately explained by a traditional one-dimensional hydrostatic loop model. Instead, a three-dimensional magnetic flux-rope model, incorporating non-thermal effects and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modifications, was proposed to account for the observations. This model successfully explained the intensity asymmetries in the 304 and 525.0 nm lines and provided insights into the overall structure of the loop. The observed heating imbalance between the upper and lower sections of the loop was identified as a key factor influencing its dynamics.

TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems.

TNOs are considered crucial for understanding planetary formation, as their orbital distribution provides insights into the evolutionary history of the Solar System.

In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could form binary systems: fission. We demonstrate that the close approach of two SDOs can lead to the creation of a third SDO due to a significant differential torque.

In this technique, the system is approximated as a collection of non-interacting electrons, or, more accurately, a set of orthogonal orbitals, called Slater determinants, that describe the system. TheHartree-Fock equation, wherein the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals, is then iterated to self-consistency, that is, to a solution in which the orbitals do not change between iterations. Several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have since been developed. The coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert  3  and developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy  4 , is one such generalization. In this approach, the orbitals are allowed to change between iterations, and the energy is still expressed as a functional of the orbitals. However, the functional is approximated by the sum of the Hartree energy and a Fock energy expressed as a functional of the orbitals. Variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT) is a similar generalization, proposed by Edward  5  and developed by Hyberts and Wood  6 . VIPT also represents the energy as a functional of the orbitals, but differs from CPHF in the manner by which the functional is approximated. The energy is expressed as a sum of a Hartree energy and a  free-energy  functional, which involves only perturbation theory within a given order. Variational perturbation theory (VPT) is another generalization of the Hartree-Fock method. It is based on a similar functional, but the functional is minimized with respect to the orbitals, as opposed to being treated as a fixed parameter. All of these generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method share the feature that the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals. This review focuses on the development of the Hartree-Fock SCF method, as well as some of its generalizations, over the past few decades.

The Hartree-Fock method, introduced by Paul Hartree and Robert F. Service, and later refined by Robert Marshak, was the first SCF method and serves as a foundational approach. In this technique, the system is approximated as a collection of orthogonal orbitals, referred to as Slater determinants, which describe the system. The Hartree-Fock equations, where the energy of the system is expressed in terms of these orbitals, are iteratively solved until convergence is achieved, meaning the orbitals remain unchanged between iterations. Since then, several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have emerged. One such generalization is the coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert and later developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy. In this approach, the orbitals are adjusted between iterations, and the energy is expressed as a function of the orbitals. However, the energy is approximated as the sum of the Hartree energy and a Fock contribution expressed in terms of the orbitals. Another similar generalization is the variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT), proposed by Edward and further developed by Hyberts and Wood. VIPT also expresses the energy as a function of the orbitals but differs from CPHF in how the energy is approximated. The energy is represented as a sum of a Hartree term and a first-order perturbation term, which includes only perturbative contributions. Additionally, variational perturbation theory (VPT) is another generalization of the Hartree-Fock method, which minimizes the energy with respect to the orbitals instead of treating them as fixed parameters. All these generalizations share the characteristic of expressing the system's energy as a function of the orbitals.

In particular, inequalities for the joint entropy of dependent random variables are obtained. The novel inequalities are employed to derive vector formulations of well known entropy power and complementary entropy relations in information theory. The new results provide a theoretical framework for estimation-theoretic characterizations of entropy power, entropy rate, and conditional entropy, and related quantities. The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics.

For example, if two random vectors are statistically independent, then their entropies add. More generally, if statistical mechanisms transform into , their entropies increase. The entropy power inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) entropy power inequality are fundamental and well known results in information theory. The former states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the sum of the entropies of its components, while the latter states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the entropy of its mean. Both these inequalities hold for any random vectors. Here we present information-theoretic proofs of the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. Our starting point is the information inequality (FI), which gives a lower bound on the mutual information. Under suitable conditions, we obtain a new family of information inequalities, which imply the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities.

In this context, inequalities related to the joint entropy of dependent random variables have been developed.

The results provide a theoretical foundation for estimation-theoretic characterizations of entropy style, entropy rate, and regulated entropy, while also addressing complex dependencies. \n\nThese inequalities are pertinent to the study of multivariate dependence and have implications in various fields, including information theory and statistics. A notable characteristic of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical transformations. For instance, if two random vectors are statistically independent, their combined entropy is simply the sum of their individual entropies. More broadly, when statistical transformations are applied, the entropies tend to increase. \n\nThe entropy platforms inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) are key results in this area. The EPI states that the entropy of a random variable cannot exceed the sum of the entropies of its components, while the ER asserts that the entropy of a random component cannot be less than the entropy of its distribution. Both inequalities are valid for any random vectors. \n\nIn this work, we present information-theoretic proofs for the entropy platforms and entropy rate inequalities.

Numerical simulations indicate that the empirical distribution of the statistic is well-controlled, and the results are consistent across various scenarios. We also provide a real data example to illustrate the applicability of our proposed method. For further details, you can access the paper on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00965 by Zhenyu Bai and Zheng Liu, June 2023, Version 1.0.\n\nAs a significant stochastic process, fractional Brownian motion (fBm) has found applications in various fields. For instance, it has been observed that complex physical systems, such as earthquakes and turbulent winds, exhibit long-range correlations akin to those of fBm. Consequently, models based on fBm have been utilized in a wide range of disciplines, including financial analysis, economic activity, astrophysics, and geophysics. However, there are scenarios where it is necessary to test the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is either fBm or an alternative process. For example, when analyzing empirical data, one might suspect that the sample path exhibits fBm behavior during certain periods, but displays different behavior during others. Therefore, it is crucial to have a statistical method for determining whether a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm or an alternative model. Such a method should be robust (with accurate Type I error rates) and maintain a power of one. The closest prior work to this study was proposed in a previous paper, where the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm was tested using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Hurst parameter, and the LSEE was employed to analyze the sample path. Under certain regularity conditions, it was shown that the test had valid properties and that its power approached one. However, the regularity conditions were quite restrictive, making it challenging to extend this approach to more general settings. In this work, we propose a method for testing the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm.",

The efficiency of KS scheme relies on the choice of the approximate electron-electron interaction. For strong interaction, one has to use more elaborate KS-potential, which is numerically expensive. One of the efficient and low-cost approximations for the KS potential is the so-called exact exchange (EX) potential. This potential is constructed as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to the electron density. The density obtained from the KS equations with the EX potential as a part of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is very close to the actual one. However, the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS-potential yields a very large gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not correspond to the experimentally observed excitability of the systems. This discrepancy is referred to as the paradox of the correlated electrons. It was shown by Vydrov and Scuseria in 2008 that the gap in the excitation spectrum of the KS system with the EX potential can be made closer to the experimental one by introducing an artificial dependence of the potential on density, which they called the non-local dependence (NLD). In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term. The non-local term appears due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron density. We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into account. We present the KS equations with the new XC potential and prove that the solutions of the equations coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS potential. This solution eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the correlated electron systems described by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential.",

        "rewrite_text": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme is a widely utilized framework in theoretical chemistry and quantum mechanics, particularly for addressing the Schrödinger equation in systems influenced by Coulomb interactions. The effectiveness of the KS scheme hinges on the selection of an appropriate approximation for electron-electron interactions. For certain interactions, it becomes necessary to incorporate a more complex KS potential, which can be computationally demanding. One notable approximation within the KS framework is the so-called exact exchange (EX) method. This approach is recognized as a benchmark for exchange interactions based on electron density. The electron density derived from the KS equations using the EX method closely approximates the true ground state. However, employing the KS framework with the EX method leads to significant discrepancies in the excitation spectrum, which do not align with experimentally observed excitations. This issue is commonly referred to as the paradox of correlated electrons. In 2008, Vydrov and Scuseria demonstrated that modifying the excitation spectrum of the KS system with EX can bring it closer to experimental results by introducing a new density-dependent modification, termed non-local dependence (NLD). In this context, we argue that the NLD in KS calculations arises from the fact that it is derived as a solution to the KS equations with a modified exchange-correlation (XC) potential. The non-local nature stems from the dependence of the Fock operator on electron density. We derive the conditions for the NLD that account for this dependence. We present the KS equations with the modified XC potential and show that the solutions align with those obtained using previous potentials and with the KS framework employing the EX method.

Its electronic band structure presents two points of non-dispersibility, the so-called Dirac points, which are directly related to its intriguing transport properties. Recently, this material has attracted a great deal of attention due to its response to strong magnetic fields, which is reminiscent of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. In particular, the transmission coefficient of charge carriers in graphene rings exposed to a uniform magnetic field exhibits a step-like dependence as a function of the Fermi energy, which is a characteristic signature of the AB effect. Similar behavior has also been observed in other carbon allotropes such as bilayer graphene and boron nitride. Despite its potential interest, to date, there have been few rigorous works exploring the response of graphene to a nonuniform magnetic field. In this paper, we show that a magnetic flux generated by a solenoid with a large radius, compared to the magnetic length, leads to a strongly deformed band structure in graphene, without splitting the Dirac points. Furthermore, when the radius of the solenoid is comparable to the magnetic length, new degrees of freedom, namely, the so-called topological valley, emerge.

        "rewrite_text": "Graphene, a remarkable material composed of a hexagonal lattice, is one of the most intriguing subjects in contemporary research. Its unique properties, particularly the Dirac cones, contribute to its fascinating electronic characteristics. Recently, graphene has garnered significant attention due to its behavior in magnetic fields, which is related to the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. Specifically, the transmission coefficient of charge carriers in graphene rings subjected to a magnetic field shows a dependence reminiscent of the AB effect, influenced by the Fermi energy. Similar phenomena have also been observed in other allotropes, such as bilayer graphene and boron nitride. Despite the growing interest, there has been limited research on graphene's response to nonuniform magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate that a magnetic field generated by a solenoid with a large diameter, when aligned with the magnetic field, leads to a significant deformation of the electronic structure in graphene, without disrupting the Dirac cones. Moreover, when the solenoid's size is comparable to the magnetic field, new degrees of freedom, referred to as topological valleys, emerge. We find that the conductance spectrum differs from the typical AB effect, particularly in the limit of a strong magnetic field. Finally, we relate our findings to a practical device that utilizes the AB effect in graphene.",

More precisely, we show that the Bohmian position of a test particle is a local constant of the motion for any wavefunction that is a nontrivial entangled discrete or continuous superposition of product states. We give an explicit formula for this local de Broglie-Bohm wave in terms of the original wavefunction, and we apply our result to delocalized solutions of the one-dimensional quantum many-body dynamical Yang-Lee model, which includes the 1D Bose gas, the 1D hard-core gas, and the spin 1/2 XX model. We establish this result by first considering a discretized version of the original wavefunction, in which the original wavefunction is a nontrivial entangled superposition of product states. We then show that a similar result holds for the continuous limit of this discretized wavefunction. The proof proceeds by showing that the Bohmian position is a constant of the motion for any wavefunction that is a product state of the original wavefunction and its complex conjugate. We show that the real and imaginary parts of the continuous limit of the discretized wavefunction each have this property, and then prove the result by proving that the real and imaginary parts of the original wavefunction satisfy this property separately.

Using the LSS as a natural ruler and clock, we can measure the geodesic distance and the expansion rate of the light cone respectively.

Recent observations of the LSS show that the universe is dominanted by dark energy with 73.8% of the total energy density4, while the density of matter is only 26.2%. This result is known as the cosmic acceleration. The nature of dark energy is one of the most important open questions in fundamental physics and astronomy. Since the equation of state (EOS) of dark energy strongly correlates with the expansion history of the universe, a precise measurement of dark energy EOS can be achieved by using the LSS as a natural ruler. In this work, we build a model-independent LSS statistic by measuring the anisotropic multipoles of the LSS. By using a cubic-mapping formula to interpolate the LSS in simulations, we measure the multipoles up to the order of 10 in the anisotropic case. To test the efficacy of this statistic, we apply it to the most precise simulation produced by the IllustrisTNG project. We find that the measurement of the first two anisotropic multipoles can break the degeneracy between the EOS and the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN). Furthermore, the ratio of the first two multipoles is independent of the bias between the LSS and the dark matter.

        "rewrite_text": "The Descend-Platforms Sequel Spectrum (LCP) has been introduced as a novel statistical approach to analyze the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe. In the context of standard cosmological requirements, the LSS presents a significant advancement, particularly due to the rapid dynamics of the baryonic field and the propagation speed of sound. By utilizing the LSS as a foundational framework and reference point, we can accurately measure the geodesic distances and the light's expansion rate. This study aims to explore gravitational phenomena in an anisotropic universe through the latest insights derived from the LSS. Recent observations indicate that dark energy dominates the universe's composition, accounting for 73.8% of the total density, while ordinary matter constitutes only 26.2%. This finding is pivotal in understanding cosmic acceleration. The evolution of the equation of state (EOS) is crucial in cosmology and astrophysics. Given that the EOS of dark energy is closely linked to the universe's expansion dynamics, precise measurements of the EOS can be obtained using the LSS as a reference. In this research, we develop a model-independent LSS statistic by analyzing the anisotropic multipoles of the LSS. By employing a cubic-spline interpolation method in simulations, we extend our analysis to multipoles up to the 10th order in the anisotropic measurements. To validate the effectiveness of this statistic, we compare it with the most accurate data produced by the IllustrisTNG project. Our findings suggest that measuring the first two anisotropic multipoles can help resolve the degeneracy between the EOS and the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) framework. Moreover, the measurements of these multipoles are independent of any biases between the LSS and the underlying matter distribution. Consequently, this LSS statistic presents a promising avenue for investigating dark energy and its implications for cosmic evolution.",

However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a viable model for the observed diversity of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

Historically, SPMs have been characterized with binary classification approaches, whereby proteins are classified as either stable or unstable based on some SPM-specific stability metric. While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult.

Recently, a new paradigm for analyzing SPMs has emerged, known as decomposition analysis. This method begins by characterizing the wild-type protein using a residue-level approach, such as molecular mechanics energy decomposition analysis (MM-EDA). For each SPM, it then breaks down the overall stability difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins into contributions from individual residues. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how SPMs impact stability. We applied this approach to the recent CO-BRASS dataset, which includes experimental data on 402 alanine mutations in flavodoxin (a 7.3 kD protein). Each mutation was analyzed in both oxidized and reduced states, revealing that 220 mutations led to significant stability changes. Using the decomposition analysis, we were able to accurately predict whether an SPM would increase or decrease stability, achieving a classification accuracy of 91% on the dataset. Notably, this performance was achieved without relying on any additional features or structural data. \n\nTable 1: Classification performance of our model on the dataset.",

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",

A strong R-matrix is a non-linear operator that, together with a related linear operator (the S-matrix), yields an associative product that defines a finite-dimensional non-commutative ring with unity, known as a finite braided commutative algebra (FBCA). In this work we describe computation of R-matrices for eight binary QC codes using the RIME framework. We use the abelian setting where the S-matrix is a diagonal matrix to compute R-matrices that are also diagonal, and give examples of non-abelian R-matrices for the same codes. We discuss how the R-matrices interact with RIME to establish ideal lattices for each of the codes. The eight codes we study are optimal two-level codes, two-level extended Hamming codes, and five four-level codes commonly used in surface-code quantum computing. Our computed R-matrices have many nice properties, including compatibility with the abelian setting and simple structure when viewed as a lattice over the real numbers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. In particular, we describe the case where the R-matrix is a real diagonal matrix as a families of real numbers (depending on several parameters) where each number occurs with multiplicity one and each occurs exactly twice. We also show how to compute R-matrices corresponding to non-abelian structures when the S-matrix is diagonal. The RIME framework for computing R-matrices in the abelian setting makes use of an appropriately modified quantum chess problem, the Hamilton Pfaffian QC-polynomial. In particular, each symmetry of the chess problem corresponds to a permutation matrix in the R-matrix, and these permutations satisfy a precise lattice-theoretical restriction. In the non-abelian case, no analogous check for R-matrix structure appears to be known, so alternative techniques must be used to establish non-abelian R-matrices. In this work, we describe a non-abelian RIME framework that similarly uses a modified Hamilton Pfaffian but with the permutations no longer required to satisfy a lattice-theoretical restriction. Instead, an ad-hoc method for establishing non-abelianity is used. Finally, we present a few experiments using RIME to establish security of communication over common communication channels (such as WiFi or cell-phone networks).

        "rewrite_text": "The acceleration of the universe remains an unexplained phenomenon. One of the most discussed explanations is presented in the book \"Meanwhile,\" which describes either a cosmological constant or a dynamically modified form known as quintessence. At first glance, it is challenging to distinguish between these two scenarios using observational data. However, we demonstrate that this distinction becomes clearer if we have additional information about the state of the universe. Our analysis focuses solely on linear cosmological perturbations and assumes a state parameter \\( W = 0 \\). We find that it is possible to differentiate between the two scenarios if \\( W \\) remains constant for more than 50% of the observational period. If the state parameter is not constant, distinguishing between the two scenarios becomes difficult. Similarly, if the state parameter is constant but its value is not significantly different from -1, it is also challenging to make a distinction. However, if the state parameter is constant but varies over time, we can differentiate between the two scenarios, particularly for values of \\( W \\) close to -1. We conclude that it is feasible to distinguish between a cosmological constant and quintessence if the state parameter is constant and significantly deviates from -1. This finding does not confirm whether the universe is governed by a cosmological constant or quintessence, but it provides insights into these two possibilities. Moreover, it is not possible to differentiate between two cosmological constant scenarios if their values are very similar. However, if we assume that the state parameter remains constant, it becomes easier to distinguish between a cosmological constant and quintessence. This discrimination can be tested with current data, but we need to refine our understanding of the state parameter. Future research will require more precise data to determine whether this parameter is indeed constant or not.

We investigate the complexity of this task, demonstrating that for a simple entangled collaborative scenario, it becomes challenging to solve within a specific factor. Our findings suggest that for a basic entangled state, the entangled games are difficult to resolve within a constant factor. Additionally, we show that the entangled game remains complex when the operations are close to a product state.

Initially classified as a spectroscopic binary, which complicated the interpretation of its planetary system, UScoJ1609-2156 is now understood to comprise at least three components. Two of these, USco1609A and B, are M-dwarf stars in a close hierarchical orbit with periods of approximately 1 day and an apsidal alignment that results in a combined orbital duration of about 6 hours. The third component, UScoJ1609-2156C, is a distant companion located at a projected distance of approximately 14.7 arcseconds (around 400 AU) and is the most remote component suitable for observational studies. My research on UScoJ1609-2156 was conducted in collaboration with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP) during an event held in Seattle, Washington, from April 9 to 11, 2020. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the system and its components, discussing the methods used for parameterizing and detecting multi-planet systems. Finally, I will conclude by outlining future research opportunities for studying UScoJ1609-2156C and the broader implications for understanding solar-type systems.",

        "original_text": "Massive galaxies at high redshift (z ~ 2) are thought to build up the massive galaxies observed in the local universe1, 2. In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",

        "rewrite_text": "Significant evidence suggests a rainy redshift (z ~ 2) that pays tribute to the observations of aquatic phenomena in the evolving universe. In this context, we explore the capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength datasets to analyze the physical properties of the most massive galaxies during these critical epochs. We find that the characteristics of galaxies at these redshifts are predominantly quiescent, with some undergoing merging processes, contrasting with previous indications of active star formation in early galaxies. More specifically, we observe a continuous increase in the stellar mass growth rate of galaxies from z = 2 to the present, with indications of a decline in the average star formation rate and size of these galaxies over time. Our findings suggest that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with models that assume a uniform evolution of galaxies over time without considering other factors. We conclude that the distinct growth rates of the most massive galaxies at high redshifts differ from those observed in the present day. While the growth of these galaxies is inefficient, it contributes to the overall development of the stellar populations we observe today. Additionally, this growth is not uniform, as it involves a combination of both minor and major mergers, with each contributing similarly to the overall growth. This process of dry merging is sufficient to account for the observed stellar mass of early galaxies. Furthermore, this scenario naturally explains the correlation between stellar mass and star formation rates: as galaxies grow through merging, the most luminous regions evolve more slowly than the overall mass. These results help clarify long-standing questions regarding the growth of stellar populations. They suggest that early elliptical galaxies primarily grew through major mergers throughout much of their existence, which may explain the observed correlation between stellar mass and star formation rates. Our findings also imply that massive galaxies at different redshifts were not simply downsizing, as previously suggested by observations of some high-redshift galaxies. Instead, we propose that the differences in physical properties and star formation rates between present-day galaxies and those at high redshifts can be attributed to the much longer timescales involved in the merging processes of these galaxies. While the specifics of these differences remain a topic of ongoing research, our results highlight the significance of growth through merging in shaping the evolution of galaxies, particularly in the context of massive galaxies at high redshifts.",
