In these frameworks, dilatons and/or axions are introduced as additional degrees of freedom alongside gravitons. Dilatons couple directly to photons, while axions couple to photons and gluons through a more complex interaction. These couplings result in violations of the EP. For instance, in scalar-tensor theories, photons acquire a distinct polarization state due to their interaction with the scalar field. Consequently, the speed of light becomes dependent on its interaction with the scalar field. If the scalar field varies along the path of light propagation, the speed of light will also change.

Consequently, the transmission spectrum displays sharp resonances with narrow bandwidths, which are desirable for various applications. However, despite extensive theoretical work on SWR in periodic multilayers, there remain significant gaps in understanding the conditions under which this phenomenon can be effectively realized. For instance, experimental findings indicate that the presence of misaligned anisotropic layers can disrupt the SWR effect, even when other layers are properly aligned. Conversely, numerical simulations suggest that...",

Our findings indicate that for sufficiently high densities, there exists a phase where all rods align along one direction (the x-axis), leading to layers that correspond to this alignment. The transition from disordered to ordered states occurs through a first-order phase transition, which we analyze by examining the density profiles across the system as well as the distribution of local densities. For low densities, however, no such ordered state is observed. Instead, the system displays glassy dynamics characterized by long relaxation times. Additionally, we demonstrate how our results can help explain experimental observations of colloidal suspensions under shear flow. In many physical systems, it has been noted that particles tend to organize into regular patterns when subjected to strong external forces. This phenomenon is often referred to as capillary action or self-assembly. In two dimensions, particles can form stripes, hexagons, or other complex structures depending on their interactions and external fields. These patterns have garnered significant interest in recent years due to both theoretical implications and experimental observations. A notable example is found in colloidal suspensions, where applying shear can lead to the emergence of striped phases, suggesting intricate underlying mechanisms at play.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe study of state variables plays a crucial role in various fields, including condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics, and astrophysics. It is essential to understand how thermodynamic quantities interact under different conditions. For instance, these interactions can be used to describe properties such as pressure (P), chemical potential (µ), entropy (S), heat capacity (Cv), compressibility (κT), thermal expansivity (αp), and sound speed (cs), all of which depend on density and temperature (T). In this context, we will use the term Equation of State (EOS) to refer to any of these quantities. We focus on scenarios where the interaction length between two species becomes very large, causing the system to behave like a gas of weakly bound dimers. This phenomenon is exemplified in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates, where the interaction strength can be adjusted using Feshbach resonances.\n\nII. THEORETICAL APPROACHES\n\nA. Grand Canonical Ensemble\n\nTo describe the behavior of a mixture consisting of Nα particles of species A and Nβ particles of species B, we utilize the grand canonical ensemble framework. Here, H represents the total Hamiltonian of the system, β ≡ 1 / kB T is the inverse temperature, μi denotes the chemical potential of species i ∈ {A, B}, and Z (Nα, Nβ) is the partition function.",

Recently, several authors have sought to address some of these issues by employing concepts from statistical mechanics, such as entropy and dynamical phase transitions.

For instance, one can consider the von Neumann entropy \\( S = -\\text{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho) \\), where \\( \\rho \\) represents the density matrix of a system. This formulation highlights the uncertainty inherent in measurement processes, and the time derivative \\( dS/dt \\) leads to the concept of entropy production rate. It has been shown that this rate plays a crucial role in characterizing the irreversible behavior of closed quantum systems. Specifically, if the entropy production rate is zero, the quantum mechanical model exhibits reversible dynamics.

Our analysis demonstrates how these hubs can be identified through their topological properties using concepts from statistical mechanics. We observe that the distribution of these hubs follows a power law with an exponent of approximately 2.5 ± 0.1 across various types of networks, including social networks like Facebook and Twitter, as well as biological networks such as metabolic pathways and recommendation systems. This finding is consistent across different network sizes and structures. Our results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems and help identify key players within them. Complex networks play a vital role in numerous fields, including physics, biology, computer science, engineering, and economics, where they represent interactions between entities. A common characteristic of most complex networks is the presence of hubs—highly connected nodes—whose removal can significantly impact the network's functionality. In this study, we focus on identifying these hubs based solely on their topological features. To achieve this, we employ statistical mechanics techniques to analyze the structure of various networks. Our findings reveal that the distribution of hubs adheres to a power law, with an exponent of 2.5 ± 0.1, regardless of the type and size of the networks examined. Notably, this scaling behavior persists even when considering only the largest component of each network. These results suggest that the observed scaling is not merely a consequence of network size but rather reflects an inherent property of complex networks.",

In this context, we explore an application of the distance Lyon problem to music and introduce a novel method for the automatic conversion of musical scores into symbolic representations based on the concept of pitch class profiles (PCP). The proposed platform enables us to recover the intended harmonic structure of polyphonic music by solving a system of quadratic equations effectively using convex optimization techniques. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on various musical pieces.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe automatic analysis of musical scores has been a significant challenge in the field of music science over the past few decades. It involves recovering the harmonic structure of a piece of music from its audio or MIDI file. This task can be divided into two main subtasks: the detection of note onset and the estimation of pitch for the notes identified. Note onset detection is typically achieved through heuristic methods applied to the raw audio data. Once the note onset points are established, the next step is to estimate the pitch corresponding to these events. Various approaches exist for tackling this problem, ranging from simple methods to more sophisticated statistical models. In this study, we focus on the estimation of pitch, also known as pitch tracking. Pitch tracking aims to assign a pitch value to each detected note, resulting in a sequence of pitch values that corresponds to the original audio. A common method for representing pitch is through pitch class profiles (PCPs), where each profile indicates the number of occurrences of a specific pitch within a defined window around the written music. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a pitch class profile derived from a single-note melody.",

However, this does not imply that all possible configurations can serve as ground states. For instance, the ground states of the one-dimensional model are unique despite having a continuous spectrum, while those of the two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate. Recently, several authors have studied the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI). They numerically demonstrated that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on square lattices when J1 = J2 or J1 < J2. Conversely, the ground states were found to be unique on the honeycomb lattice.

In this talk I will explain how it can be used to study quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial topology.   The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.    This leads naturally to the concept of a  quantum torus  whose zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the corresponding QFT.   We will also discuss some recent results concerning the relation between the zeta functions of certain families of quantum tori and their associated modular forms. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been developed into a powerful tool for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level. However, many interesting questions remain open due to the difficulty of performing calculations beyond perturbation theory. One way out of these difficulties is to use ideas from mathematics such as those coming from number theory or algebraic geometry. In particular, we are interested in using the so-called  zeta-functions  of algebraic varieties to obtain new insights into QFTs.

        "rewrite_text": "The zeta function is a fundamental tool in number theory and algebraic geometry. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how it can be applied to quantum field theory (QFT) in spacetimes that are not necessarily smooth. The approach involves considering the Feynman path integral over all fields in spacetime as a framework that can be regularized by substituting the fields with certain well-defined components that have a specified norm. This leads to the concept of a quantum torus, where the zeta function encodes information about the spectrum of the quantum field theory. We will also explore significant results regarding the relationship between the zeta functions of specific types of quantum tori and their modified forms. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has become a primary framework for studying physical phenomena at the most fundamental level. However, interesting results often remain elusive due to the challenges of performing calculations beyond perturbative methods. One way to address these challenges is to incorporate ideas from mathematics, particularly those derived from number theory or algebraic geometry. In this context, we are particularly focused on using the so-called zeta functions of algebraic varieties to gain deeper insights into QFTs. These functions encode valuable information about the underlying theory, yet they are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly. In my talk, I will present examples where explicit computations have been successfully carried out and discuss how these techniques may pave the way for further advancements in our understanding of QFTs.",

        "rewrite_text": "We are investigating the evaporation scenario in a gas-thermalized environment within a quadrupole ion trap (QIT). The QIT is filled with helium buffer gas at pressures ranging from 0 to 1 mbar, which can be heated up to 1000 K for the trapped ions. We achieve evaporation by lowering the temperature of the surrounding helium gas to 300 K in less than one second. This process leads to a significant reduction in the number density inside the QIT without substantially affecting its trapping efficiency. In this study, we aim to decrease the number of stored ions by more than two orders of magnitude while keeping their kinetic energy below 10 eV per charge. Our experimental results align well with theoretical predictions based on rate equations that account for the number densities of all relevant species involved.\n\nIntroduction: Multipole radio-frequency ion traps have been widely used in recent years as collaborative spectrometers. While they have shown promise, they face challenges related to space charge effects when storing large numbers of ions. Space charge can be mitigated by cooling the buffer gas or by selectively removing ions. Cooling typically requires complex systems that may not always be feasible. Selective removal has been achieved using various methods, including differential electric fields, collisions with neutral particles, photoionization, electron impact ionization, and resonant photodissociation. In our approach, we utilize selective removal through the rapid heating of the helium buffer gas. Heating the helium causes the ions to quickly increase their kinetic energy through collisions, allowing them to escape the trap before accumulating enough energy to cause space charge issues. A similar method was recently reported, where the authors heated the helium buffer gas directly. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of evaporative cooling of the buffer gas in a quadrupole ion trap. We demonstrate how the number density of the trapped ions decreases exponentially as the flow of helium into the ion chamber is modified.",

DOI: 10.1063/1.3189000\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, significant attention has been directed towards the properties of biomembranes. It has been established that the physical responses of biological systems, such as cell adhesion, vesicle fusion, and membrane folding, are critically dependent on the structure and composition of the lipid bilayer. Biological membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids, which feature hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads. Due to the amphiphilic nature of phospholipids, they tend to self-assemble into bilayers. A typical representation of such a system is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Each layer consists of a monolayer of phospholipids arranged in a planar structure. The thickness of each layer is approximately 5 nm. The hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic tails orient away from it. The presence of water molecules within the layers results in an effective dielectric constant of the bilayer (around 80). In contrast, outside the layers, where only air is present, the dielectric constant is much lower (approximately 1). Consequently, electric field lines penetrate the interior of the bilayer but are significantly less effective in the exterior environment.",

The radio emissions are modeled as synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic particles accelerated at the termination shock between the pulsar's magnetosphere and the surrounding medium. Our findings indicate that the observed characteristics of this system align with expectations for a pulsar surrounded by a shell of ejecta. Specifically, we demonstrate the following: 1. The total energy within the SNR is approximately 10^50 erg, which includes a kinetic energy of about 500 erg for the progenitor star prior to the explosion; 2. The age of the pulsar is estimated to be around 20,000 years based on its luminosity and spin-down rate; 3. The distance to the source is constrained to be less than 5 kpc, determined using dispersion measures and an estimated electron density along the line of sight; 4.

A truecluster is defined as a collection of points in a high-dimensional space that are closely grouped together while remaining distant from other clusters. Our approach demonstrates how this method can be applied to align two sets of data points that may originate from different sources or be captured at different times.\n\nIntroduction: The issue we address here pertains to data association—specifically, the challenge of matching two sets of observations (e.g., data points) that correspond to the same physical entities. This challenge arises when dealing with varying conditions of objects, as illustrated in Figure 1, where achieving perfect registration between the two sets may be difficult due to factors such as calibration errors and occlusions. In many cases, there is some prior knowledge regarding the correspondence between the two sets of observations; for instance, if they were captured using the same sensor but at different times, their positions would be related by a scaling factor. In such scenarios, the objective is to leverage this information to enhance the accuracy of the final solution.\n\nOur approach is based on the concept of a truecluster: a truecluster is a set of points in a high-dimensional space where its members are closely related while being distinct from other clusters. For example, consider the task of registering two images of individuals standing in front of each other. Each individual forms their own truecluster, as their positions do not vary significantly. In contrast, the background may change dramatically, resulting in no single cluster representing the entire background area. Given two sets of trueclusters derived from the initial observations, we aim to determine the optimal alignment between them. To achieve this, we develop a cost function based on the distances between points within each truecluster. We then formulate the problem as a quadratic integer optimization problem and solve it using advanced techniques. Finally,...",

For instance, in cuprate superconductors, the pseudogap phenomenon arises from competing orders originating from various regions of the Brillouin zone. Similarly, in iron pnictides, the formation of a charge-density wave leads to a suppression of the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a partial gap. In heavy fermion systems, the hybridization of electronic states gives rise to complex behaviors in the spin dynamics. In this context, we present a detailed analysis of the spin fluctuation spectrum in the metallic phase of the quasi-2D superconductor.",

Among these, layered associative networks (LAN), which consist of interconnected layers of neurons through synapses, have garnered attention due to their ability to regulate learning and facilitate effective retrieval. In LANs, each neuron receives input from all neurons in the previous layer via synaptic connections. The activity level of each neuron is determined by its firing rate according to the following equation: where \\( x_i \\) represents the activity level of the \\( i \\)-th neuron at time \\( t \\).

As the number of neurons increases, the number of possible combinations of connections grows exponentially, making it challenging to store information in LANs without significant memory requirements. To address this issue, several strategies have been proposed. For instance, introducing sparsity constraints allows only a small subset of neurons to be active at any given time. However, these approaches typically necessitate supervised learning to adjust the parameters of the LAN, which can limit their effectiveness.",

These findings suggest that the first group primarily consists of pre-main sequence stars surrounded by circumstellar material, whereas the second group contains main sequence stars without any surrounding material.",

Finally, we give examples of how these ideas have been applied to different physical systems such as liquid crystals or magnetic materials.

Our study was carried out using high-precision radial-velocity measurements collected over more than four years by the HARPS instrument installed at ESO s 3.6-m telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chilean Andes), together with photometric observations made simultaneously with the CoRoT space mission. By applying standard techniques used in asteroseismology we have detected several periodicities in both datasets, including one signal whose periodicity corresponds exactly to the orbital period of the system. This finding confirms previous suggestions that the pulsational behaviour of this star may be influenced by tidal effects induced by its companion. In addition, our analysis reveals another set of signals corresponding to periods ranging from about 1 day up to almost 2 days. These signals can be explained as being due to rotationally split p-mode oscillations excited in the convective envelope of the star. Their presence provides strong support for the hypothesis that the surface of Alpha Centari A has been shaped by magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes operating within the convection zone.",

Our analysis utilized high-resolution spectra collected over more than four years with the HARPS spectrograph installed at ESO's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in the Chilean Andes, along with photometric observations from the CoRoT space mission. Using standard techniques in asteroseismology, we identified periodicities in both datasets, including one that corresponds to the orbital period of the system. This finding supports previous suggestions that the pulsational characteristics of this star are influenced by tidal interactions with its companion. Additionally, our analysis reveals another set of signals with periods ranging from about 1 day to approximately 2 days. These signals are likely due to rotationally induced p-mode oscillations excited in the convective envelope of the star. Their presence supports the hypothesis that the surface of Alpha Centauri A has been shaped by magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes occurring within the convection zone.",

They have gained popularity over the past decade due to their ability to support decision-making processes. However, as the volume of data warehouses continues to grow, there is an increasing interest in developing techniques to enhance their efficiency. To facilitate this, researchers require benchmarks that can evaluate the performance and scalability of different data warehouse systems, including relational databases, columnar databases, and NoSQL databases.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most intriguing topics in modern physics. Its existence has only been inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, as well as through various experimental observations. Despite numerous theoretical models proposed to explain DM, none have been experimentally validated so far. One possibility is that DM consists of exotic elementary particles. If these particles interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter, they could escape detection unless produced in large quantities. Conversely, if they interact strongly with normal matter, they could be directly detectable. Several experiments have been conducted to search for DM, yielding various results. Recently, findings from the DAMA experiment have garnered significant attention. According to these results, an annual modulation in detected signals correlates with the Earth's orbit around the Sun, showing an increase in detected recoils from June to October compared to December to February. Such behavior cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model of particle interactions. Various authors have proposed different interpretations of these findings.",

This topic has been explored primarily within the framework of linearized gravity, where GWs are treated as small perturbations of a flat Minkowski background. In this study, we focus on the effects of gravitational self-coupling. This self-coupling arises because each mode of a gravitational wave carries energy density that exerts a force on itself through Newtonian interactions. Consequently, the total force acting on any segment of a gravitational wave depends not only on the local curvature but also on the entire structure of the wave. It turns out that these self-forces lead to distortions in the wave packets. For instance, the shape of a critically damped wave packet changes over time, causing its peak to shift in the direction of motion. Similar behavior has been observed in spherical wave packets.",

Our analysis indicates that the presence of anisotropy in Bianchi type I models leads to a suppression of the low-l polarization in the spectrum. This finding can serve as a distinguishing feature between Bianchi type I models and their FRW counterparts. The detection of large-scale polarization in WMAP data has been interpreted as evidence against inflationary scenarios with Gaussian perturbations. Recent studies suggest that this interpretation may be premature if deviations from statistical isotropy in the primordial spectrum are taken into account.

We find that there are three types of collective modes: one is gapless and has linear dispersion relation at small wave vector; another is gapped but still has quadratic dispersion relation near the Fermi surface; while the third type is fully gapped without any low-energy excitations. The latter two types can be regarded as phonon-like collective modes. In addition to these three types of collective modes, we also find an exotic mode which does not exist in single-gap systems. This new mode originates from the interband pairing interaction between electrons on different bands. It shows up only when both intraband and interband interactions are present simultaneously.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the collective modes in two types of superconductors with different gaps and symmetries, utilizing the random phase approximation (RPA). Our analysis reveals three categories of collective modes: the first is gapless and exhibits linear dispersion at low wave vectors; the second is gapped but has quadratic dispersion near the Fermi surface; and the third type is fully gapped with no competing excitations. The second category can be characterized as phonon-like collective modes. In addition to these three types of collective modes, we also identify a unique mode that does not exist in conventional systems. This mode arises from the interband pairing interaction between different bands and is only present when both intraband and interband interactions meet specific criteria. Our findings indicate that these collective modes are essential for understanding the behavior of high-temperature superconductors. \n\nThe study of multiband superconductivity has gained significant attention recently due to its occurrence in materials such as MgB2, Sr2RuO4, and FeSe. These superconductors feature multiple orbitals per unit cell, leading to multiple bands crossing the Fermi level. The presence of multiple bands significantly influences the electron-phonon interactions. Additionally, the effects of Coulomb repulsion become more pronounced in multiband systems. These factors contribute to the rich physics of multiband superconductors. \n\nIn recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the physical properties of high-temperature superconductors. For instance, experimental studies have explored vortex dynamics, magnetic field dependence, thermal conductivity, and NMR relaxation rates. Theoretical approaches have included methods such as strong-field theory, Eliashberg formalism, renormalization group techniques, variational Monte Carlo simulations, and quantum Monte Carlo methods to investigate ground state properties and thermodynamic behavior.",

Volborthite has been studied extensively by neutron scattering experiments but its microscopic origin remains controversial. We show that the ground state of CFPOH can be described within density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation plus Hubbard U method for Fe-3d orbitals. The calculated spin wave spectrum agrees well with experimental data obtained by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. In addition we find that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is dominated by spin-orbit coupling effects. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous theoretical studies based on different approximations. V olborthite, CaF e 3 (P O 4 ) 2 (OH) 3 ·H 2 O (C F P OH ), is one of the most impor-tant minerals in geological sciences because it forms at low tem-peratures under hydrothermal conditions  1  .

        "rewrite_text": "We present an ab initio study of the electronic and magnetic properties of volborthite, CaFe3(PO4)2(OH)3·H2O (CFPOH), which is a significant mineral found in geological formations as it forms under high-temperature hydrothermal conditions. Although volborthite has been investigated through modified experimental techniques, its microscopic properties remain poorly understood. Our findings indicate that the electronic structure of CFPOH can be accurately described using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation and the Hubbard U method for the Fe-3d orbitals. The calculated electronic band structure aligns well with experimental data obtained from inelastic neutron scattering, confirming its validity. Additionally, we find that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is primarily influenced by spin-orbit coupling effects. We also discuss how our results relate to previous theoretical studies that employed different approximations. Volborthite, CaFe3(PO4)2(OH)3·H2O (CFPOH), is an important mineral in geological research due to its formation at elevated temperatures in hydrothermal environments. First identified in 1832, it has only recently garnered detailed structural studies that classify it within the intriguing family of Kagome materials. Volborthite crystallizes into a unique kagome lattice structure composed of iron and phosphate groups, which gives rise to various physical phenomena, such as geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations. For instance, recent experiments suggest that volborthite undergoes a magnetic phase transition below T_N = 5 K, where the spins align in a ferrimagnetic manner. However, there is still no consensus on the nature of this magnetic order: while some researchers argue for a collinear arrangement, others propose that non-collinear configurations play a crucial role.",

This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical.

        "rewrite_text": "We derived the gravitational field equations for successor spherically symmetric configurations on a Randall-Sundrum type II brane, incorporating bulk cosmological conditions and matter fields residing on the branes. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, these solutions can be expressed as modified embeddings within an anti-de Sitter space. Furthermore, we find that there is no restriction on the mass parameter \\( M_0 \\) appearing in the solution of the Einstein equations on the brane. Notably, the parameter \\( r_0 \\) satisfies the relation \\( r_0 = (3M_0 / 4\\pi)^{1/3} \\). This result suggests that the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric encompasses not only black hole solutions but also naked singularity solutions. Finally, we discuss how these derived equations are affected when quantum corrections due to loop effects are taken into account. \n\nPACS numbers: 04.20.-q; 11.10.Kk. Supersymmetry has been proposed as an extension of general relativity that could provide a consistent framework for modifications at all scales. Recent studies have shown that it does not yield any significant predictions when applied to standard four-dimensional theories. Conversely, higher-dimensional extensions of supergravity have garnered considerable interest in recent years. In this context, we examine five-dimensional supergravities where the extra dimensions are compactified on a circle or orbifold. These models are known as Randall-Sundrum type I and type II, respectively. They facilitate the localization of Standard Model fields and their excitations on the so-called visible brane, while gravitons can propagate freely through the bulk. Consequently, these models address certain issues related to the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. Moreover, such frameworks open up possibilities for the existence of regular black hole-like solutions.",

However, the precise characteristics of these events remain uncertain. One class of systems that emit strong gravitational waves are known as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs).

A notable example of SYM is illustrated by the Seiberg-Witten limit, where the gauge group simplifies to U(1).

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe distorted kagome lattice has garnered significant attention recently due to its realization in materials such as volborthite, kapellasite, herbertsmithite, and vesignieite. These compounds have been studied extensively through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Volborthite, in particular, exhibits rich physical phenomena, including a magnetization plateau around one-third of the saturation magnetization. It has been suggested that these features arise from the presence of distorted kagome layers. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the microscopic mechanisms behind these phenomena. For instance, what types of interactions are crucial, and is the distortion necessary? To address these questions, it is essential to investigate the effects of distortion using appropriate methods. While some studies have been conducted, they often focus on small systems or weak interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand how the distortion influences the magnetic properties of the distorted kagome lattice. In this context, we examine quantum spin-1/2 models with spatially anisotropic exchange interactions on the distorted kagome lattice, as illustrated in Figs. 1.",

For instance, if the interface profile includes a genuine step, the resulting spectrum can become discrete. Additionally, the presence of steps can lead to interesting excitations, such as surface plasmons.

We focus on binaries with total mass M = 100-1000M⊙ that evolve through collisional nuclear environments at high redshifts z > 10. Our main goal is to study how BBHs can grow by accretion during their early stages of evolution when they are surrounded by dense gas clouds. In particular we investigate whether these systems can reach masses above 1000M⊙ before merging within a Hubble time. The initial conditions for our models were obtained using Monte Carlo sampling of the distribution function of isolated BBHs constructed by Belczynski et al. (2010) .

It is important to note that our calculations were performed without any approximations beyond those typically used in previous studies employing the EOM formalism. Our numerical results indicate that, at temperatures below 10 K, the primary source of dephasing arises from interactions with acoustic phonon modes. At higher temperatures, other mechanisms become increasingly significant, affecting the overall performance of the QDs. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with experimental data on QD ensembles. Finally, we found that including exchange interactions enhances the spin coherence time and alters its temperature dependence.",

Specifically, we found that: \n- Most PSRs are expected to have companion masses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 solar masses; \n- Most PSRs are likely to orbit with semi-major axes of less than 100 AU; \n- Most PSRs will not transition into millisecond pulsars prior to their first supernova explosion; \n- Most PSRs will experience significant gravitational wave emission throughout their lifetimes.",

Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector.

        "original_text": "We present an analytical model for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in diatomic molecules, which is based on the concept of molecular orbitals and their associated electronic wavefunctions. The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure.

The HHG process can be described in three main stages: First, electrons are ionized by intense laser fields.

We demonstrate that this approach leads to a straightforward expression for the harmonic intensity, which depends solely on two parameters that characterize the molecular system. This finding allows us to interpret the interference patterns observed between different harmonics as a result of constructive or destructive interference from contributions of various molecular orbitals. Additionally, we illustrate how our model can be utilized to predict the emission characteristics of different molecular configurations. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), which involves the emission of photons at integer multiples of the laser frequency, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in generating ultraviolet light, as well as in attosecond pulse generation, photoelectron spectroscopy, and tomography. The underlying physics of HHG was initially described by the semiclassical three-step model, where an electron is ejected from its atomic potential into the continuum by the laser field. It then propagates freely before being driven back toward the nucleus by the same field, ultimately recombining and emitting a photon whose energy corresponds to the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy. Since then, various extensions of this model have been proposed, including the quantum-orbit theory, which accounts for the influence of the laser field on electron dynamics.

Introduction\nCoronal holes (CHs), which appear darker in white light images captured by coronagraphs on satellites such as SOHO or STEREO, are believed to play a significant role in solar wind dynamics due to their unique magnetic fields that allow modified solar winds to escape into interplanetary space (e.g., Wang et al. 1998; Cranmer & van Ballegooijen 2005).

Through numerical simulations with varying values of the spin temperature (T_S), we find that the 21-cm power spectrum exhibits a distinct feature that reflects the properties of these H II regions. This feature becomes more pronounced as T_S increases, as the number of neutral hydrogen atoms rises due to the interaction between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the 21-cm emission line. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to use this feature to constrain the value of T_S. However, since there are other factors that can affect the 21-cm power spectrum beyond T_S, additional observations will be necessary before drawing definitive conclusions about its detectability.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\n\nRecent experiments on quantum degenerate gases have opened new avenues for understanding strongly correlated systems. Ultracold atomic gases have been employed as model systems to investigate phenomena such as fermionization, supersolidity, and Mott insulating states. In this context, we focus on a specific class of experiments where the response of these systems to sudden parameter changes can be examined. For instance, altering the strength of inter-particle repulsion or the density can lead to interesting dynamics before the system reaches thermal equilibrium. During this nonequilibrium phase, the system exhibits novel features such as dynamical scaling and non-thermal fixed points. These insights are crucial not only for our understanding of quantum matter but also for exploring new phases of matter. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosonic systems. One intriguing aspect is when the system is excited to a state above the ground state. It has been observed that even when the system is far from equilibrium, it tends to relax to a state described by a Gibbs distribution. However, if the initial state is deeply within the ordered phase, the dynamics may differ significantly.",

This disagreement can lead to fluctuations that may be exacerbated by noise, especially when agents rely solely on their individual signals.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that these effects persist in both classical and quantum states with non-Gaussian statistics.

        "rewrite_text": "In October 2005, we conducted new photometric and spectroscopic observations of the solar nova EX Hya, which was notably bright at a magnitude of V = 8. The light curve indicates that EX Hya is an intermediate polar with an orbital period of P_orb = 0.084 days. Our findings reveal the presence of two accretion regions on the surface of the white dwarf, which are responsible for the double-peaked emission lines observed during the outburst. Additionally, we detected narrow absorption features at velocities reaching -1500 km/s, which may be attributed to previous eruptions. Our results suggest that EX Hya has returned to a quiescent state following its last outburst in September 2002. While classical novae have been recognized since ancient times, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenomena are believed to result from thermonuclear runaways triggered by the ignition of hydrogen on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the specifics of this process and its contributing factors. One significant aspect is the nature of the WD's magnetic field. It is widely accepted that the strength of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining whether a system will undergo a thermonuclear runaway. If the magnetic field is too weak, a runaway will not occur; conversely, if it is too strong, the WD may become fully convective, which could inhibit further outburst activity. This complexity is highlighted by the fact that some WDs experience periodic outbursts despite having magnetic fields that appear too weak to allow for full convection. These systems are classified as Intermediate Polars (IPs), where the WD's magnetic field is strong enough to synchronize the orbital periods but does not impede the accretion of matter onto the WD.",

There has been considerable interest in this model due to its potential applications in quantum information, quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and more. For instance, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble is influenced by the total angular momentum \\( J = \\frac{N}{2} \\) (where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms). Originally proposed over fifty years ago, the Dicke model has since been the subject of various theoretical approaches.

This approach works well in the weak coupling regime, where the interaction between the atoms and the field is relatively small. However, it encounters limitations in the strong coupling regime due to the emergence of unphysical states. Recently, some authors have sought to address these challenges by introducing modified transformations or approximations, although their solutions still exhibit certain limitations.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nIn recent years, there has been significant interest in higher-order gravitational theories due to their potential role in quantum phenomena and as alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in modified gravity scenarios. However, despite these efforts, our understanding of the physical implications of these higher-order terms remains limited due to technical challenges associated with solving their equations. One of the primary difficulties arises from the fact that the equations of modified gravity involve derivatives of arbitrary order, making them challenging or impossible to solve analytically. A common approach to address this issue is to expand the fields around a chosen background solution and truncate the expansion after a finite number of terms. While this method can yield useful insights into the dynamics of the system, it may overlook important features, such as the interactions between different modes of the same field or between different fields. For instance, in the context of inflationary cosmologies based on higher-order modifications, truncated perturbative expansions may not accurately capture the full extent of primordial non-Gaussianities. A more systematic approach to tackle these challenges involves the use of covariant techniques originally developed within the framework of GR. These techniques allow us to express the equations in a manifestly gauge-invariant manner.",

Our findings indicate that electron trajectories can be focused into narrow beams when their velocities are directed oppositely along the magnetic field. This phenomenon arises from the interference between two distinct types of motion: cyclotron orbits and the so-called Zitterbewegung oscillations, which together create a beating pattern superimposed on the primary cyclotron orbits. The resulting modifications are attributed to the relativistic nature of the particles and the splitting of the energy bands. Our results offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect and the integer quantum Hall states in two-dimensional systems. \n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe behavior of two-dimensional (2D) systems of fermions in magnetic fields has been extensively studied, revealing novel phases characterized by fractional quantum states. The presence of a quantizing magnetic field leads to unique phases where the number of filled Landau levels deviates from expected values. In this study, we focus on non-relativistic fermions in a 2D system subjected to a uniform magnetic field \\( B = B e_z \\). For simplicity, we consider only one species of fermions; however, our results remain valid if both species are taken into account. Additionally, we assume that the Fermi level lies within the conduction band. Under these conditions, the excitations around the Fermi surface can be effectively described by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian, where \\( v_F \\) represents the Fermi velocity, and \\( \\sigma_i \\) (for \\( i = x, y, z \\)) are the Pauli matrices acting on the spinor wave function \\( \\Psi \\).

It has been suggested since the work of Pati and Salam that if quarks and leptons are unified into larger multiplets, it may be possible to explain the observed patterns of quark-lepton mixing within Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). However, despite numerous attempts over the past three decades, no satisfactory GUT has been developed that successfully incorporates all aspects of the Standard Model (SM). \n\nIn this context, another intriguing possibility arises: if the SM fields exist in higher-dimensional representations, they may exhibit Kaluza-Klein excitations corresponding to states with masses proportional to 1/R, where R is the size of the extra dimension. These states would typically have masses that exceed those found in the SM spectrum, leading to interesting phenomenological implications. A key aspect of this scenario is the assumption that only gravity propagates in the bulk, while the SM fields are confined to a four-dimensional brane. This setup results in modifications to the Newtonian interactions between two point masses m_1 and m_2, which depend on the distance between them. Here, M_P = 1/√(8πG_N) ≈ 10^19 GeV represents the reduced Planck mass, and the index i denotes the number of extra spatial dimensions.

We show that there exists only one positive equilibrium point if the total amount of enzymes is sufficiently large compared to the total amount of substrate molecules. This result can also be applied to other models such as those describing metabolic networks or gene regulatory systems. The proof relies on the fact that the system has a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point when it is considered under mass action kinetics.

Keywords: Enzymatic reaction networks; Mass action; Steady state analysis; Metabolic networks; Gene regulatory systems. 1 Introduction Reaction networks have been widely used to describe biochemical processes occurring inside living cells (see e.g.,  1  ,  4  ). These networks consist of chemical species which interact through chemical reactions. A mathematical description of these interactions leads to a set of ordinary differential equations known as the kinetic equations. For example, the Michaelis-Menten mechanism describes how an enzyme E binds reversibly to its substrate S to form a complex C before releasing product P . It consists of three elementary reactions given by \nwhere k + i and k − i denote respectively the forward and backward rate constants associated with the ith reaction.

Our findings indicate that there is only one equilibrium state for the system, provided that the total concentration of enzymes is sufficiently high relative to the total concentration of substrate molecules. This result is applicable to other models, including metabolic networks and gene regulatory systems. The analysis is based on the observation that the system possesses a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium when considered under mass action kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable, even though the system does not exhibit Lipschitz continuity. Finally, numerical simulations support our theoretical results. \n\n**Keywords:** Enzymatic reaction networks; Mass action; Steady-state analysis; Metabolic networks; Gene regulatory systems. \n\n**1 Introduction**  \nReaction networks are essential for modeling biochemical processes occurring within living cells (see, for example, references 1 and 4). These networks consist of various species that interact through a series of reactions. The mathematical representation of these interactions is typically formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations known as kinetic equations. For instance, the Michaelis-Menten model describes how an enzyme (E) binds reversibly to its substrate (S) to form a complex (C), which then produces a product (P). This process can be broken down into three elementary reactions, with rate constants denoted as k+ and k− for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. If we denote the concentrations of the reactants and products as S, E, P, and C, the corresponding kinetic equations are: \n\ndS/dt = k2 * E * S - k−1 * C,  \ndE/dt = k3 * C - k−2 * E,  \ndC/dt = k4 * C - k−3 * P.  \n\nHere, the parameters k_i represent the rates of the different reactions. It is important to note that the first two equations describe the formation of the complex, while the last equation pertains to its dissociation into the enzyme and product.",

The results imply that there are opportunities to observe the quadrupole moment of black holes by monitoring specific signals during the inspiral phase. This provides valuable information about the spacetime geometry near the black holes, which cannot be obtained through other means.\n\nIn this study, we examine how the behavior of the so-called Carter constants is affected by the spins and angular momentum in binary systems with two rotating black holes. The Carter constant is a key invariant associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter, 1968). It serves as a measure of the spacetime geometry near the black holes, as its value changes significantly only when there is a deviation from axial symmetry at small radii (Bardeen, 1973; Thorne et al., 1986). For instance, the presence of an accretion disk can alter the Carter constant, even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr, 1963).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the dynamics of binary systems with rotating components are influenced by the black hole quadrupole moment, represented as Q = M(1 - S²)/c²R², where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar, 1999).

The experiments are conducted at room temperature and in controlled environments. Our results affirm that volume entropy consistently increases over time, aligning with theoretical expectations. This also validates the effectiveness of our measurement system. Additionally, we explore various aspects of our findings. The study of thermodynamics has been extensively examined, particularly in relation to irreversible processes such as phase transitions and chemical reactions. Previous attempts to experimentally validate these concepts have faced challenges due to the failure to account for all relevant quantities. It has been theoretically suggested that incorporating entropy is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved. Thus, in this study, we present a differentiated approach to the modified principles of thermodynamics by directly measuring volume entropy.",

If validated, this would have significant implications not only for cosmology but also for fundamental physics. However, the origin of these GWs remains one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. To account for the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), various models beyond the standard model of inflation have been proposed, including supersymmetric grand unified theories and supergravity models. These models typically predict energy scales around 10^16 GeV. It has been demonstrated that the presence of such heavy fields could lead to viable inflationary scenarios. However, the existence of these heavy fields could also produce an excessive number of gravitons unless their couplings to ordinary matter are sufficiently suppressed. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the production of gravitational waves within these models does not conflict with CMB observations.

We propose that these systems illustrate two distinct formation mechanisms for DNSs: one in which both components are formed through standard stellar evolution, and another where one component forms through this process while the other is born as a black hole or a white dwarf. This distinction may account for some short gamma-ray bursts. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.76.084011",

Introduction\nIt has been established that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs). An SMBH can gain mass through accretion via a surrounding accretion disk. Since the discovery of quasars over 30 years ago, observations have revealed that most AGNs exhibit broad emission line profiles in their spectra, indicating the presence of rotating accretion disks. However, theoretical models suggest that such disks should become unstable if they rotate too rapidly, raising the question of how these systems maintain stability. One proposed mechanism is that the disks are stabilized by magnetic fields or relativistic effects. In this letter, we investigate the dynamics of accretion disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that account for both gas pressure and self-gravity. Our primary objective is to determine whether the surface density distribution of the disk is smooth or exhibits spiral structures, and if the latter is the case, to identify the underlying causes.\n\n2.

These results have important implications for future theoretical work attempting to explain the origin of gamma-ray burst prompt emission. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of gamma rays lasting only milliseconds, were discovered over thirty years ago but their exact cause remains unknown. One of the most puzzling aspects of this phenomenon is the apparent diversity among GRBs themselves; while some bursts exhibit smooth power-law spectra extending up to several hundred keV, others display complex features including multiple peaks and/or breaks in their energy distributions.

Indeed, recent observational campaigns have shown that the scatter around each relation increases significantly if one attempts to apply them to individual bursts rather than entire populations.

These findings have significant implications for theoretical frameworks attempting to explain the origins of gamma-ray prompt emissions. GRBs, which are brief flashes of gamma radiation lasting only milliseconds, were first detected over thirty years ago, yet their underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. One of the most intriguing aspects of GRBs is their diversity; while some exhibit smooth spectra extending up to several hundred keV, others display complex features, including abrupt changes and variations in their temporal profiles. Despite this diversity, researchers have identified common trends among all GRBs, which can be summarized by two main empirical relationships: the Amati relation and the Ghirlanda relation. Both of these relationships connect the photon energy at lower energies (greater than 100 MeV) to other observable quantities, such as total fluence and duration. Although these relationships appear statistically valid when applied to large samples of GRBs, they do not necessarily indicate an intrinsic connection between the observables involved. In fact, recent observational studies have shown significant scatter in these relationships when analyzed across different GRB events rather than across the entire dataset. Furthermore, the fact that similar relationships also seem to apply to X-ray flares suggests that these observations cannot be solely attributed to variations in viewing angles. Instead, these findings indicate a more complex underlying structure in the emission processes of GRBs.",

Introduction \nIn recent years, various classes of high-energy astrophysical objects have been identified through their emissions at very high energies (E > 10 GeV). These include blazars, radio galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, starburst galaxies, and possibly some other exotic sources. However, many of these objects remain poorly understood due to a lack of observations at lower frequencies, where most of the significant processes occur. Furthermore, it has been challenging to detect the highest energy photons, which can reach energies up to 10^20 eV. One hypothesis is that such photons are generated during interactions involving extremely energetic particles in regions close to supermassive black holes. Alternatively, they may arise from the decay of neutral pions when cosmic rays collide with ambient matter. If confirmed, these phenomena could provide valuable insights into acceleration mechanisms occurring near these energetic environments. Recently, the HESS collaboration reported the detection of a bright, exquisite gamma-ray source located at RA = 20h 32m 41s and Dec = +39°30'00\".",

This task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with large systems composed of interacting particles or spins. For such systems, significant approximations are often necessary, as exact calculations become infeasible due to the exponential increase in the number of microstates with the system size N.

However, within this framework, calculating the partition function Z = Tr exp(−βH) becomes extremely complex.\n\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in developing theoretical frameworks for macroscopic configurations that parallel those used in quantum mechanics. These approaches are motivated by the observation that both classical and quantum descriptions share common features: they can be expressed in terms of wave functions ψ(x), where x represents either the positions of particles or their spins.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of hadronic interactions plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics between quarks and gluons within hadrons. Investigating the parton distribution functions provides essential information about the spatial distribution of quarks and gluons inside hadrons. Recently, there has been significant interest in exploring the internal structures of hadrons beyond the leading-order level, particularly the momentum-dependent parton distribution functions. In this context, we focus on another type of nonperturbative quantity: the distribution amplitudes (DAs). These amplitudes represent the probability of finding a quark-antiquark pair with specific momentum configurations at a given separation distance. It has been demonstrated that DAs play a vital role in various hard scattering processes. For instance, the decay constants fBπ and fBs can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs; the dynamics of semileptonic decays such as B→πlνl and B→Klνl depend on both the lowest and next-to-lowest order DAs. Additionally, it has been shown that the heavy-to-light transition form factor FV (for B→V transitions) is influenced by these distribution amplitudes.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present the findings from our numerical simulations of magnetized, rotating white dwarf components undergoing accretion-induced collapse (AIC). Our simulations indicate that for sufficiently rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields, AIC can lead to explosions that resemble those observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The explosions are characterized by the dynamics of the system as it reaches critical density, resulting in detailed bounces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of a toroidal magnetic field can induce asymmetries in the distribution of the ejecta. These asymmetries may be responsible for the polarization observed in some SNe Ia. \n\n**Keywords:** Type Ia Supernovae, Rotation, Magnetic Fields, White Dwarf Stars, Accretion-Induced Collapse\n\n**1 Introduction**  \nRecent observations have revealed significant polarization in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), suggesting that these events may arise from asymmetric explosions. This asymmetry could be attributed to large-scale magnetic fields or rapid rotation. However, it remains uncertain whether either of these factors can produce the observed polarized light curves. In this study, we explore the role of rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields in the context of accretion-induced collapse (AIC), where a white dwarf collapses into a neutron star. To investigate this, we conduct two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code. Our models consist of rigidly rotating white dwarf configurations with masses ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 solar masses. To account for relativistic effects on the dynamics of the white dwarf, we employ a polytropic equation of state, P = Kρ^Γ, where ρ represents the density and P the pressure. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether AICs triggered by rapid rotation and/or strong magnetic fields can account for the observed polarization in SNe Ia.",

These discrepancies can be explained by considering the effects of torsional oscillations in the Sun's convective zone.

        "rewrite_text": "We demonstrate that the non-Gaussian characteristics observed in financial returns arise from microscopic interactions among agents and their slower dynamics, resulting in non-trivial correlations across different assets. We propose a model for these correlations based on random matrix theory (RMT), which is capable of capturing all statistical properties of the return data. The distribution of stock returns has been extensively studied, and while it can often be approximated by Gaussian components, notable deviations have also been documented. Recent research has shown that the tails of the return distribution exhibit a power-law decay, P(x) ~ x^(-α), with α approximately equal to 3 ± 0.1. This finding challenges the predictions of conventional models such as Black-Scholes and Heston, which suggest that the decay exponent should be 2. To account for these deviations, we focus on a model grounded in random matrix theory. RMT addresses the statistics of complex systems whose dynamics are influenced by a large number of degrees of freedom. It has been successfully applied to various phenomena, including fluctuations in financial markets, wave propagation, phase transitions, quantum aging, and more. Recently, RMT has also been employed to analyze the statistical properties of stock returns. In this work, we will concentrate on the Dyson Brownian motion model, which describes the evolution of a system subjected to white noise.",

Our findings may provide valuable insights into the physical mechanisms underlying recent experimental observations.\n\nIntroduction: The Kondo effect has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. It arises from the formation of a many-body singlet state between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons near the Fermi level, resulting in a pronounced zero-bias anomaly in the differential conductance. Recent studies have shown that this effect can occur even in the absence of magnetic impurities. The Kondo effect has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in spintronic devices. For instance, it can be utilized to develop novel transistors or single-qubit systems. However, several questions remain regarding the Kondo effect, such as how it depends on the characteristics of nanostructures and what additional factors might influence the system. To address these questions, various theoretical approaches have been proposed. Among these, the nonequilibrium Green's function technique provides powerful tools for analyzing current flow through these systems under different conditions. This approach allows us to obtain not only the steady-state properties but also to investigate the dynamic response of the system under varying external fields.",

This discovery has prompted theorists to explore various approaches to describe this state of matter, utilizing effective theories such as hydrodynamics or more complex models involving quark-gluon plasma droplets. In order to better understand the dynamics during the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, it would be beneficial to experimentally investigate the properties of the hot medium created in these events. However, due to its extremely short lifespan, this medium cannot be directly probed through conventional scattering experiments. Instead, information about the properties of the medium must be inferred indirectly from final-state observables. For instance, the collective expansion of the system results in anisotropic emission patterns, leading to azimuthal asymmetries. These anisotropies have been generated and found to correlate well with theoretical predictions. Another important observable that characterizes the dynamics of the expanding fireball is the spectrum of emitted particles, which has been shown to depend sensitively on the properties of the medium. Furthermore, the observed suppression of high-pT hadrons provides additional insights into the dynamics at play.",

These attributes open up new possibilities for designing advanced photonic molecules, including single-mode lasers that can operate at room temperature without the need for complex component arrangements. The proposed structures are based on photonic molecules formed from semiconductor microdisks with slightly varying diameters.

Numerous efforts have been made to construct extensions of the SM that incorporate additional fields or particles, driven by the observation that none of its fundamental components have been experimentally verified.

A notable aspect of these models is the presence of a scalar component, denoted as H0, which mixes with the SM-like Higgs boson. Consequently, both states acquire distinct physical masses. If the mixing angle is small, the mass of H0 will be close to that of the Higgs boson.

This approach was applied to both simulated and experimental Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) data collected during DNA replication, with a time resolution of 10 ms. Our findings illustrate how this method allows us to investigate and characterize the transitions between distinct conformational states of the replisome machinery. Notably, we discovered a previously unrecognized transition where the helicase changes its directionality while remaining bound to the fork junction. This insight into the dynamics of the replisome enhances our understanding of its function under physiological conditions.\n\nSingle-molecule experiments have gained popularity due to their ability to provide detailed insights into processes such as protein folding and enzymatic reactions. However, extracting meaningful information from these complex systems necessitates advanced analytical techniques, particularly when dealing with intricate datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel computational framework for analyzing time-resolved data from single-molecule experiments. Our approach focuses on identifying pairs of states within a dataset that are connected through alternative pathways. These so-called state-modified molecular events, although infrequent, play a crucial role in determining system behavior.\n\nThe underlying concept of our analysis is illustrated in Figure 1. Consider a hypothetical scenario with three consecutive states, s1, s2, and s3, along a defined pathway. If there exists an alternative connection between s2 and s3, both states would project to the same outcomes. Each state has multiple outgoing transitions that contribute to the overall dynamics of the system. For example, if the system starts in state s1, it may either remain in s1 or transition directly to s2 after a certain delay. Similarly, starting in s2 could lead to either staying in s2 or moving to s3 immediately. Finally, starting in s3 always results in a return to s1. Consequently, any transitions between these states significantly influence the system's behavior.",

Introduction\n\nStellar ages are crucial in various fields of astrophysics, ranging from galactic studies to exoplanet research. Accurate age determinations are essential for understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, obtaining precise ages for stars presents challenges due to their complex relationships with temperature and luminosity, as well as the intricate nature of stellar evolution. For instance, while the ages of main-sequence turn-off stars can be estimated using photometric techniques such as theoretical isochrones and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods become less reliable beyond certain evolutionary stages where convection processes dominate. Additionally, while asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the internal structures of evolved stars, the interpretation of such data requires detailed modeling of each star's characteristics. Consequently, alternative methods must be explored to estimate ages for large samples of stars across different evolutionary stages. Gyrochronology offers a promising approach for age estimation based on the rotation rate and magnetic activity of stars, which is influenced by dynamo processes occurring in the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003). It has been demonstrated that the Rossby number (Ro), defined as the ratio of the rotation period (P) to the convective turnover timescale, plays a significant role in this context.",

Finally we give a brief description of how one can construct such a coordinate system locally around a given point using parallel transport along curves starting at p.

The first section outlines some of the terminology and differentiable concepts used throughout the text.

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a differentiable structure at each point in \\( M \\), which allows us to express nearby points in terms of their coordinates relative to this structure. Finally, we provide an example of how one can construct such a differentiable structure locally around a point using curves that originate from that point. \n\nThe subsequent section introduces the concept of a vector field \\( X \\) defined over the entirety of \\( M \\). This is represented by a map \\( F: TM \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), where \\( TM \\) denotes the tangent bundle of \\( M \\). We demonstrate that if \\( X \\) satisfies certain conditions, there exists a unique smooth function \\( f: M \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( X = \\text{grad}(f) \\), where \\( \\text{grad}(f) \\) denotes the gradient of \\( f \\). For instance, if \\( M \\) is a surface embedded in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\), then \\( X \\) could represent the gradient of a scalar function defined on \\( M \\). If we assume that the structures evolve according to Newton's laws of motion, the function describing these structures will reflect the dynamics of the system under consideration.

While it has been extensively studied experimentally, researchers have only recently begun to explore its microscopic origins. In this context, we examine a system comprising two weakly coupled superconductors (S) connected by a normal metal region (N), known as diffusive SNS junctions. These systems exhibit interesting phenomena, such as proximity effects, which lead to the formation of a minigap within the N region. Another notable characteristic of these devices is their ability to carry both charge and spin currents, making them promising candidates for various applications, from quantum information processing to magnetic field sensing. Recently, there has been significant interest in studying the properties of diffusive SNS junctions. For instance, theoretical studies have shown that the current-voltage characteristics depend strongly on the transparency (T = R_Q / R_N) of the NS interfaces, where R_Q is the quantum resistance and R_N is the resistance of the N region. However, experimental confirmation of this prediction has been challenging due to difficulties in fabricating high-quality NS interfaces.

These features have been extensively studied both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003; Done et al. 2004).

Introduction \nIt is well established that the Milky Way consists of three main components: the stellar disk, the halo, and the thick disk. However, the processes by which these components were assembled during the Galaxy's formation remain unclear. To address this, it is essential to study their properties separately, as they exhibit distinct characteristics. For instance, the low metallicity of halo stars suggests that the halo formed earlier than the disk (e.g., Twarog 1980), while the abundance ratios, such as [Fe/H], indicate that the halo contains elements produced by supernovae, which would not be expected if it had formed more recently like the disk (e.g., Nissen & Schuster 1997).

Introduction. The geometric aspects of solutions to the Einstein field equations in general relativity have been extensively studied in recent years. Previous works have highlighted the importance of utilizing symmetries, such as HM differentiability or tensor fields, to analyze these solutions. In this study, we focus on a different approach known as nonholonomic deformation, where we modify the anholonomy coefficients of nonlinear connections (N-connections) related to the Christoffel symbols.

We examine two models of the Commonwealth that are observationally indistinguishable but originate from different physical principles: one is based on fluctuations from Minneapolis, while the other arises from effective field requirements of various quantum components. In both cases, there exists a framework where the predictions align with observations within experimental uncertainties. However, if experimental platforms can differentiate the modified equations of motion from Minneapolis, it would be significant to distinguish between these two scenarios. The phenomenon of cosmic acceleration has garnered considerable interest regarding the possibility that our universe contains some form of dark energy. This dark energy component drives the current expansion of the universe and influences its dynamics on a large scale. Numerous theoretical proposals exist for what such a component might entail. One prominent class of possibilities involves introducing new fields into Einstein's equations, which would lead to repulsive gravitational effects. In recent studies, researchers have explored the phenomenology associated with various forms of these fields. Many of these investigations focus on comparing theoretical models against observational data or examining their implications for cosmological observations.

The system shows resilience against disorder and dephasing effects. This research was supported by NSERC (Canada) and CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research). \n\nRecently, there has been an increasing interest in investigating electron interactions in semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum dots and carbon nanotubes. These devices incorporate various components, including metrology, electron transistors, and spintronics. In these systems, charge carriers traverse the device through a process known as sequential tunneling. Several theoretical studies have indicated that achieving high efficiency in these devices at room temperature is feasible. However, most prior research has focused on adiabatic processes, where the driving frequency is significantly lower than other relevant energy scales. \n\nIn contrast, recent experiments have reported substantial currents generated by nonadiabatic effects. This raises the question of whether these findings can be reconciled with existing theoretical frameworks. To investigate this, we consider a simplified model of a quantum dot connected to two leads, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The energy levels of the quantum dot are periodically modulated by oscillating gate voltages on either side. When the modulation period aligns with specific conditions, coherent tunneling occurs between the leads, allowing for efficient charge transport. Here, E_F represents the Fermi energy of the leads.

These systems offer exciting opportunities to explore novel phenomena such as supersolids, soliton dynamics, and orbital interactions. In this study, we consider a specific scenario involving two distinct species of atoms that interact via s-wave scattering, potentially in different internal states. This scenario naturally arises when examining mixtures of hyperfine states or isotopes within the same atomic type. For example, experiments with 87Rb and 41K have successfully created mixtures of different hyperfine states through evaporative cooling. Another possibility involves using 40K and 6Li, where one species can be viewed as impurities within a background of heavier fermions. Conversely, if the masses were reversed, the heavier species could serve as impurities.",

This suggests that additional mechanisms may be necessary to account for the observed mass functions. Furthermore, our results imply that primordial binaries may play a significant role in shaping the mass functions observed in these clusters.",

Introduction\n\nDistributed consensus problems frequently arise in various applications, such as flocking, resource allocation, multi-agent coordination, and wireless sensor networks.

However, this assumption does not always hold, as the underlying graphs can be dynamic due to changing network conditions. Recent research has focused on the challenges of distributed consensus in dynamic networks.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe presence of small particles can significantly influence the behavior of larger particles through depletion effects. These interactions play a crucial role in various physical phenomena, such as crystallization, gelation, and sedimentation. Depending on their relative sizes, the particles can be either miscible or immiscible. Additionally, there are regions of metastability and phase separation. Several theoretical studies have explored the impact of depletion on the phase diagrams of simple model systems. However, many of these studies rely on idealized models that overlook hydrodynamic interactions, finite particle sizes, polydispersity, and other complexities. Recently, some researchers have begun to incorporate more realistic features, such as Brownian motion, electrostatic repulsion, and van der Waals attraction. Despite these advancements, predicting the phase behavior of these systems remains challenging due to correlations among the particles. Furthermore, the effects of depletion on the structural and dynamical properties of complex fluids warrant further investigation. In recent years, experimental studies have contributed to this growing body of knowledge.",

We find that the light curve of this object shows many similarities with those observed for other SU UMa-type systems but also some significant differences. In particular we note that there are no clear signs of rebrightening following either the first or second superoutburst; nor do we see any evidence for a double-humped structure in the light curves at all phases of these events.

For instance, some brain regions exhibit more complex connectivity than others, while some show higher levels of synchrony. It is unclear whether these differences reflect distinct wiring rules or are simply the result of random fluctuations. To address this issue, we propose a novel computational approach utilizing machine learning techniques. Specifically, we aim to develop models that predict the connectivity between pairs of brain regions based solely on their features. To achieve this, we will create a training dataset consisting of pairs of nodes with known connections. We will then train a classifier to learn the relationship between node features and connectivity. Finally, we will apply the trained model to unseen data to infer unknown interactions.",

These transformations can include transitions between polymorphs, amorphous states, and liquid crystalline structures. Such structural changes have been shown to significantly affect the electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and catalytic properties of modified materials. Consequently, understanding these transformations has become increasingly important for various applications, from household products to catalysis.

However, this information is not always readily obtainable through experimentation due to kinetic barriers, making computational techniques valuable. Unfortunately, most theoretical models require specific parameterization and detailed experimental conditions before they can be effectively applied. While some recent approaches have utilized neural networks, there remains uncertainty about their generalizability.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the effects of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in a densely packed two-dimensional electron system characterized by parabolic dispersion and Zeeman splitting, under the influence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane. Our findings indicate that the SHC remains unaffected by the specific parameters of the system, including the Zeeman energy and the Fermi level within the Zeeman split bands. These results are supported by the Kubo formula in conjunction with self-consistent Born approximation techniques. Recent studies have demonstrated that spin currents can be generated without any net charge flow when electrons traverse a non-magnetic material under the influence of spin-orbit coupling. This phenomenon, which was initially predicted theoretically and later confirmed experimentally, is attributed to the Rashba interaction, which induces a force that alters the trajectories of electrons, leading to spin polarization. Although there has been significant theoretical work on the spin Hall effect, most of these studies have focused on scenarios with weak or no magnetic fields, where Landau levels do not play a significant role. Conversely, it is well established that Landau level quantization is crucial in determining various physical phenomena, such as magnetoresistance and optical absorption, particularly near the quantum limit. Therefore, it is essential to explore how Landau levels influence the spin Hall effect.",

        "original_text": "The hypercube model is used to describe the evolution of life in terms of its complexity, speed, and stability.  The model shows that there are limits imposed by protein stability on how complex an organism can be as well as how fast it evolves molecularly.   It also suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago when most animal phyla appeared simultaneously. This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially.

This model illustrates that there are inherent limits on the complexity of modifications based on stability, as well as how rapidly these modifications can evolve at a molecular level. It suggests that these limits were likely reached during the Cambrian explosion, approximately 540 million years ago, when most major animal phyla emerged. This model provides insights into how life has diversified across various aquatic environments, from genetic variations to ecological interactions. In this context, we introduce a framework for understanding the evolution of life through the lens of the hypercube model. We argue that the essence of life can be characterized by three key dimensions: complexity, speed, and stability. These three components are crucial for understanding biological systems as they evolve over time. For instance, organisms may become more complex by developing additional structures such as organs or limbs; they evolve in response to genetic variations; and they achieve greater stability when mutations do not lead to premature extinction. Figure 1 illustrates our conceptualization of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents a distinct aspect of living matter concerning each dimension. As depicted in Fig. 1A, the number of vertices along any dimension depends on the chosen level of differentiation. At higher resolutions, the number of possible states increases exponentially. For example, if we consider only two states per dimension—simple versus complex, or unicellular versus multicellular—the total number of combinations would be eight (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), representing eight distinct forms of life.

Introduction\nLattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) is one of the most promising approaches for understanding the interactions between quarks and gluons, and it has been extensively used to compute hadronic properties such as masses and decay constants. However, it faces the so-called sign problem: the fermion determinant \\( \\text{det} D_m = \\exp(-\\text{tr} \\{ D_m \\}) \\) can vary significantly depending on the gauge configurations, where \\( D_m \\) represents the Wilson-Dirac operator. Consequently, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly applied to extract physical results using LQCD, as they require a well-defined weight function. To address this challenge, various strategies have been developed. Among these, the Taylor expansion has proven to be particularly effective, allowing us to evaluate the expectation values of observables within statistical uncertainties. It also enables calculations at finite temperature and/or density. For instance, the Taylor expansion up to \\( O(a^6) \\) has been successfully implemented.",

The presence of these components could lead to violations of causality. Lastly, we explore potential experimental tests for our hypothesis. \n\nVacuum fluctuations play a crucial role in quantum field theory, giving rise to various phenomena, including spontaneous emission, blackbody radiation, Casimir effects, Lamb shifts, and Hawking radiation. However, the nature of the vacuum state remains unclear. We assert that the vacuum does not merely signify the absence of matter fields but also encompasses fluctuations in spacetime. These fluctuations can be interpreted as virtual gravitons. We term them holographic noise (HN) because they emerge from the entanglement between different regions of spacetime.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the essence of our proposal can be understood through the interaction of two observers, Alice and Bob, positioned at opposite ends of a spacetime region. Each observer has access to half of the total degrees of freedom within their respective causal diamonds. For instance, if Alice is near the edge of her region, she will have access to all information about events within her past light cone, while Bob's knowledge is confined to his own light cone.

Home range models suggest that animals navigate through environments composed of discrete habitat patches. They make choices among these patches based on various factors, including resource availability, vegetation type, predation risk, and population density. This decision-making process continues until the animal reaches a balance between its movement rate and the availability of resources. Various modeling approaches exist for simulating animal movements, with one prominent category being random walk models, which describe movements as independent decisions about direction and distance. However, this assumption may not always hold true. For instance, if two areas offer similar resource availability, it is unlikely that an animal will move freely between them. To address this behavioral response, Moorcroft and colleagues have proposed alternative modeling strategies.",

The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).  We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:  the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.  In both cases we have considered three types of initial conditions: Gaussian random fields generated using the Zel dovich approximation, Gaussian random fields generated using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and white noise.  Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.  However, there are some differences between them at early times.

This result shows that the choice of the initial conditions may affect significantly the final value of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations predicted by inflationary theories.",

Our findings indicate that all these models yield similar predictions at redshifts up to z = 0.5. However, differences emerge at lower redshifts. Specifically, the Zel'dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to the other models because it does not account for certain effects in the expanding universe. Conversely, the white noise model results in smaller fluctuations due to its statistical nature, while the Gaussian random fields generated via the modified Fourier transform yield intermediate values. This analysis demonstrates that the choice of random field significantly influences the final spectrum of primordial density fluctuations predicted by inflationary models.",
