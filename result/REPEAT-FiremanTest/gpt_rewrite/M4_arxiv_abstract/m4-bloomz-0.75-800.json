Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of the SM, offers potential solutions to various theoretical challenges. However, SUSY models face constraints from existing experimental observations. To address these issues, researchers have proposed various mechanisms. One approach involves introducing extra gauge symmetries, while another considers the implications of extra dimensions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that there exists a class of models where the lightest superpartner is a gravitino. The gravitino interacts weakly, resulting in a decay rate that is significantly slower than that of a neutralino. This characteristic makes the gravitino a viable candidate for dark matter. Furthermore, if the gravitino mass (m_3/2) is less than 1 GeV, its lifetime becomes longer than that of other particles. Thus, gravitinos can be considered as potential candidates for dark matter. On the other hand, gravitinos are unstable due to their decay processes. They decay into photons or lepton-neutrino pairs.

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening.

Our findings indicate that the formation of QDs is influenced by two primary mechanisms: surface diffusion and strain relaxation. The former tends to smooth the QD density profile, while the latter contributes to its steepening. We demonstrate that for small values of QD dispersion, there exists a critical growth rate above which stable QD arrays cannot be achieved. This insight explains the challenges encountered in producing empirical QD arrays with larger sizes using conventional techniques. \n\nKeywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy.\n\n1. Introduction\nSemiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots (QDs), also known as colloidal quantum dots, have garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications. They can be utilized in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors, and they also play important roles in biological systems. The most common method for growing QDs is through the Stranski-Krastanov process, which involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate followed by annealing. Under these conditions, nucleation occurs across the sample area, leading to the evolution of QD arrays through Ostwald ripening. However, this technique does not allow for the precise control of QD sizes within each array. Recent advancements have enabled the production of ordered QD arrays, but they require very precise conditions during deposition. \n\n2. Model Description\nWe consider a model for the behavior of QDs on a two-dimensional lattice. Our starting point is the continuum model proposed by Tersoff et al.",

The DGC consists of several proteins including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin.   In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding for dystrophin lead to loss of this protein from the sarcolemma resulting in severe muscle wasting.

        "original_text": "We present the results on the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for stars at different latitudes and distances from the Galactic plane, based on spectroscopic data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that MDFs are similar to each other within errors except those at |b| > 30° where there is an excess of metal-poor stars compared to the disk population. The fraction of metal-poor stars increases towards higher latitude. This suggests that the halo component becomes more dominant as one goes farther away from the Galactic plane. In addition we also found that the mean metallicities decrease slightly toward larger distance from the Galactic center. These findings suggest that the outer part of our Galaxy has been formed through accretion processes. \n \n Keywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n It is well known that the Milky Way consists of three main components -the thin disk, thick disk and halo. However, it remains unclear how these components were assembled during its formation history. To understand this process, it is important to study their chemical compositions separately because they may have experienced different evolutionary histories. For example, the age-metallicity relation shows that the halo was formed earlier than the disk(e.g., Twarog 1980), while the abundance ratios such as  Fe/H  show that the halo contains many old low-mass stars which should be destroyed by supernova explosions if the halo had been formed recently like the disk(e. g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). \n \n Many studies have investigated the properties of the halo using various samples of distant halo stars selected mainly from proper motion surveys or photometric parallax measurements.

Our analysis reveals that the MDFs are generally similar across different regions, except for those at |b| > 30°, where there is an observed excess of metal-poor stars, indicating a transition to the halo population. The halo of metal-poor stars tends to be found at higher latitudes, suggesting that the halo component becomes more prominent as one moves away from the Galactic plane. Additionally, we found that the average metallicities of stars gradually increase with greater distances from the Galactic center. These results imply that the structure of our Galaxy has been shaped through a process of accretion. \n\nKeywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey \n\n1. Introduction\n\nIt is well established that the Milky Way consists of three main components: the stellar disk, the halo, and the thick disk. However, the processes by which these components were formed remain a topic of investigation. To address this, it is essential to study their properties separately, as they exhibit distinct characteristics. For instance, the metallicity distribution indicates that the halo formed earlier than the disk (e.g., Twarog 1980), while abundance ratios such as [Fe/H] suggest that the halo contains a higher proportion of primordial stars, which would not be expected if it had formed more recently like the disk (e.g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). Many studies have examined the properties of the halo using samples of distant halo stars selected from various surveys or through photometric parallax methods. Recently, large spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000), the RAVE survey (Steinmetz 2003), and the SEGUE survey (Yanny et al. 2009) have provided us with extensive data on the characteristics of the halo.",

Introduction\n\nWith the rapid advancement of mobile devices such as laptops, PDAs, and smartphones, there is an increasing demand for high-quality service over Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). However, due to the limited resources available in WLANs, effective resource management has become critically important. The most commonly used access method in commercial WLAN products is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which employs Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) for medium access control and Point Coordination Function (PCF) for service differentiation. While CSMA/CA allows multiple stations to share the same radio channel without centralized coordination, it suffers from performance degradation as the number of active stations increases. This issue is primarily caused by collisions when multiple stations attempt to transmit packets simultaneously. To address these challenges, several solutions have been proposed. Among them, one notable approach introduced a modified Reservation Channel (VRC) to improve the efficiency of data frame transmission among different stations. Further modifications to the VRC have also been suggested to enhance CSMA/CA performance under heavy load conditions.

In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system.

Observations have revealed that the blast wave is interacting with dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor star at speeds of up to 1000 km/s. This interaction generates bright knots of emission that are observed radiating outward through the remnant's shell. These knots appear to be primarily composed of oxygen-rich ejecta mixed with shocked interstellar gas. Additionally, there seems to be a significant amount of hot gas trapped behind the shock front. Here, we present results on these features based on our data collected during the first year of the Chandra mission.",

It was observed that the resistance R(T) varies with different light intensities I0, displaying two distinct regimes: one resembling metallic behavior and the other exhibiting semiconducting characteristics. Furthermore, the transition between these regimes occurs through an intermediate state characterized by significant hysteresis. This phenomenon can be understood within the framework of semiconductor-metal transitions, particularly in relation to the thermal effects induced by the light.

Here, we consider another perspective known as Quantum Bayesianism. In Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function represents our knowledge about the system rather than its physical state. This implies that when a measurement is made, the outcome is determined by updating our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem. For instance, if Alice performs a measurement on her system along the x-axis, she updates her knowledge based on the observed value. If Bob conducts a measurement on his system in the same manner but obtains a different result, he must perform a further measurement since his knowledge has changed.",

We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions.

Introduction\nSemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This process provides insights into the quark structure of the target nucleus through the analysis of final-state particles produced alongside the scattered lepton. At high Bjorken x values, where the struck quarks are nearly on-shell, SIDIS explores the transition region between the non-perturbative regime governed by soft interactions and the perturbative domain dominated by short-distance processes. In this kinematic regime, it becomes possible to investigate the properties of bound states directly through their interactions with hard photons, thus shedding light on the dynamics of composite systems. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that the cross-section for SIDIS is highly sensitive to the transverse momentum (k_T) of the outgoing hadrons. It has been shown that the dependence of the cross-section on k_T can help distinguish between different theoretical frameworks. For instance, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism predict a significant increase in the cross-section with rising k_T, while those based on the CCFM equations exhibit much weaker dependencies. \n\n2.

INTRODUCTION \n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is one of the most prominent models in the study of non-equilibrium dynamics. It describes the behavior of particles hopping along a line of L sites under specific rules: each site i (where i = 1, ..., L) can hold at most one particle; if site i is unoccupied, a particle can hop to the right with a certain rate; otherwise, it cannot move until the occupying particle leaves. This model has garnered considerable attention due to its stationary states, which exhibit a variety of interesting behaviors depending on the parameters involved. For instance, particles tend to cluster at the leftmost sites while exiting from the rightmost sites at specified rates. When the rates are equal (e.g., when the entry and exit rates are both 1/2), the stationary state becomes uniform regardless of the initial configuration. Conversely, when the entry rate exceeds the exit rate, the stationary state displays phase separation, while the opposite condition leads to shock profiles. These characteristics make the ASEP a rich subject for exploration.",

The rate at which this happens depends on how much gas there is available for collapse.   In turn, the amount of gas available for collapse depends on the balance between inflow (from larger scales) and outflow (from smaller scales).   This talk will discuss recent work that has been done using numerical simulations to understand these processes better. It will also present some new results on the role played by magnetic fields during star formation. Star formation takes place when dense gas clouds collapse under their own gravity into bound objects called protostars.  These protostars then grow through accretion until they reach the main sequence stage where nuclear fusion begins.  During this process, gravitational energy is released as radiation and kinetic energy, heating up surrounding material and driving powerful winds and jets.  As such, understanding what controls the rate at which stars are formed requires an understanding of how gas flows onto forming stars.  Gas can flow towards forming stars either directly or indirectly via filaments.  Directly flowing gas may be channeled along magnetic field lines while indirectly flowing gas may be transported along with turbulent motions.  Both types of flows have been observed around young stars but it remains unclear whether one type dominates over another.

        "rewrite_text": "The increase in star formation is influenced by the collapse of gas clouds, which is a process that can be likened to a fictional narrative. The rate of star formation is primarily determined by the amount of gas available for this process. Additionally, the dynamics of gas are affected by the balance between inflow (from larger structures) and outflow (from smaller ones). This discussion will explore the modified courses that have been developed through numerical simulations to better understand these processes. It will also present findings on the significant role that magnetic fields play during star formation. Stars begin as gas clouds that collapse under their own gravity, forming what are known as protostars. These protostars continue to grow through accretion until they reach the main sequence stage, where nuclear fusion occurs. During this phase, energy is released in the form of radiation and kinetic energy, heating the surrounding material and generating powerful winds. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the rate of star formation necessitates a comprehension of how gas flows into these regions. Gas can move either directly or through filaments. Directly flowing gas may be guided along magnetic field lines, while gas flowing indirectly can be influenced by surrounding structures. Both types of flow are important, but it remains unclear which one predominates. Recent observations indicate that both direct and indirect flows play significant roles, depending on the specific environment. For instance, studies have shown that most massive stars form through accretion processes.",

The HOSD is particularly significant as it serves as a second-order differential operator that acts on the first-order derivatives of the function x(t). We demonstrate that the HOSD can be utilized to establish sufficient conditions for chaos invariance by examining its properties, such as negativity and monotonicity under certain conditions. Additionally, it provides an alternative framework for analyzing periodic orbits in nonlinear autonomous systems. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate our findings. \n\nKeywords: Dynamical systems; Chaos; Periodic orbits; Nonlinearity; Higher Schwarzian derivative.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLet us consider the nonautonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by x = f(t; x; u), where f: R × R^n × R^m → R^n. This framework is relevant for modeling physical phenomena across various fields. Here, t ∈ [0, T] represents time; x ∈ R^n denotes the state variables; and u ∈ R^m corresponds to external inputs or parameters. It is important to note that the function f depends explicitly on both the time variable t and the parameter components u. For instance, if we consider the motion of an object moving in a straight line with a constant speed v, the position of the object at any time t can be described by the equation x = vt + x0, where x0 is the initial position. The primary objective of this study is to develop a novel approach based on the higher Schwarzian derivative.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the stability of planar streamers in modified conditions, which are ionized regions that propagate into un-ionized gas under the influence of an applied electric field. We demonstrate how to adapt the so-called pulled front model, as described by Hoffmann, to account for the nonlinear dynamics of these slower streamers, and we analyze this experimentally using standard techniques from dynamical systems theory. Our findings indicate that there exists a critical value of the applied voltage beyond which the planar solution becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations. This result explains the challenges encountered in the experimental observation of streamer propagation at high voltages. The insights gained here should be applicable not only to gas discharge phenomena but also to other physical systems where similar dynamics occur, such as in catalytic surfaces. Streamers are modified regions filled with conductive plasma that can form when electric fields are applied between two electrodes immersed in a non-conducting medium. They have garnered significant interest over the years due to their role in various phenomena, including lightning, sprites, and high-voltage switches. Recently, there has been a surge of research focused on their formation and dynamics, highlighting their importance in both fundamental and applied physics.",

However, the implications of this new discovery raise questions, including whether it is part of a larger multiplet. In supersymmetry, each SM field has a corresponding superpartner. If R-parity is conserved, all superpartners must be produced in pairs. This scenario allows for the existence of multiple Higgs doublets. If the observed scalar Higgs boson at the LHC corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate h₀ of such a model, then the heavier CP-eigenstates H₀ and A₀ could couple strongly to fermions. Such scenarios could lead to an increased production of decays of these states into final states containing photons. To investigate deviations from SM predictions, precise measurements of the properties and couplings of the Higgs bosons are essential.",

These systems offer exciting opportunities to investigate novel phenomena such as supersolids, soliton dynamics, and orbital interactions. In this study, we consider a specific scenario involving two distinct species of atoms, which interact via s-wave scattering but differ in their internal states. This situation naturally arises when examining mixtures of hyperfine states or isotopes within the same atomic type. For example, experiments with 87Rb and 41K have successfully created mixtures of two different hyperfine states following evaporative cooling. Another possibility involves using 40K and 6Li, where one species can be treated as impurities in a background of heavier fermions. Conversely, if the masses are comparable, the heavier species may act as impurities.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most intriguing topics in modern physics. Its existence has only been inferred through its gravitational effects on various astronomical phenomena, but experimental efforts to detect it directly have faced significant challenges. Numerous theoretical models of DM have been proposed, yet none have been experimentally validated. One possibility is that DM consists of weakly interacting elementary particles. If these particles interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter, they could escape detection if produced in large quantities. Conversely, if they interact strongly with normal matter, they could potentially be detected directly. Several experiments have been conducted in search of DM, yielding various results. Recently, findings from the DAMA experiment have garnered considerable attention due to their indication of annual modulation in detection rates, which correlates with Earth's orbit around the Sun. This modulation suggests an increase in the rate of detected recoils during certain months, a phenomenon that cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model of particle interactions. Various authors have proposed different interpretations of these observations.",

The partition function is expressed as a functional integral over complex fields, which are related to the density matrix and current operators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We show that this formulation allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the time evolution of observables such as the occupation probabilities and currents through the junction between the leads and the central region. In particular we find that the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs via damped oscillations whose frequency depends on the bias voltage across the junction. This behavior can be understood within a simple rate equation approach.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe study of transport properties of mesoscopic devices has attracted considerable attention during recent years due to their potential applications in quantum information processing  1  . A particularly interesting class of problems concerns the description of charge transfer processes taking place at low temperatures when the electronic states involved in the process are localized near Fermi surfaces  2  .\nIn order to describe these phenomena one usually considers models where electrons tunnel coherently between different regions (leads) connected by some scattering center  3  , e.g., a single level  4  or multi-level  5  impurity. These models have been studied extensively using various techniques ranging from perturbation theory  6  to numerical methods  7, 8  . However, it turns out that many important features cannot be captured by perturbative approaches  9  while standard numerical schemes suffer from severe limitations  10  . For example, they do not allow to treat large systems and/or strong interactions  11  . Therefore, new theoretical tools are needed to understand the physics behind these phenomena  12  .\nRecently, there has been growing interest in developing analytical solutions for non-equilibrium transport problems based on mapping them onto effective statistical mechanics models  13  .

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\n\nThe study of modified mesoscopic devices has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in quantum information processing. A particularly interesting class of problems involves the dynamics of charge transport in systems where the relevant states are situated near the Fermi level. To address these issues, researchers often consider models where tunneling occurs coherently between different regions connected by some potential barrier, such as a single-level or multi-level impurity. These models have been investigated using various techniques, ranging from perturbation theory to numerical simulations. However, it has become evident that certain features cannot be captured by perturbative methods, while standard numerical approaches face limitations in handling large systems and strong interactions. Consequently, there is a need for theoretical tools to better understand the underlying physics of these systems. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in developing effective solutions for nonequilibrium problems by mapping them onto statistical mechanics models. One of the most successful frameworks in this context is the Caldeira-Leggett model, which describes the interaction of a quantum system with a thermal environment.",

One of the most intriguing phenomena observed in these systems is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It has been established that when the number of particles N is small, the lowest Landau level (LLL) accommodates only one electron per magnetic flux quantum. The FQHE has garnered considerable interest as it provides a unique opportunity to explore novel phenomena in condensed matter physics. Recently, researchers have examined the effects of modified Coulomb interactions between two oppositely charged particles in a magnetic field perpendicular to their plane. They discovered that the ground state energy significantly depends on whether the total angular momentum J = L + S is zero, where L is the orbital angular momentum and S is the spin angular momentum. For instance, if J = 0, the ground state energy is given by E0 = −e²/lB + O(1/N), where lB = eB/mc is the magnetic length.

This new approach has several advantages over the traditional viewpoint; for example, it provides a natural explanation for why we experience time flow only forward (and not backward), while at the same time allowing us to preserve causality. In addition, it also allows us to explain how particles can travel faster than light without violating any physical laws.

Introduction\nGraphene is a promising material that has garnered significant attention due to its remarkable physical properties. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, where each carbon atom forms covalent bonds with three neighboring carbon atoms. Due to its two-dimensional structure, graphene exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, and flexibility.

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are narrow strips of graphene, have been proposed for various applications, including transistors, interconnects, photodetectors, solar cells, and sensors. Compared to traditional silicon-based technologies, GNRs offer several advantages: they exhibit higher electron mobilities, better control over charge carriers, greater tunability of electronic properties, and the potential for flexible applications.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe modification of general relativity has opened a new avenue for understanding gravitation, particularly in relation to the Einstein-Minneapolis framework. However, despite its successes, general relativity struggles to address certain phenomena, such as black hole singularities and quantum gravity issues. As a result, various alternative theories have been proposed. One such alternative is the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory, which can be viewed as a higher-dimensional generalization of general relativity, incorporating higher-order curvature corrections. This theory admits a variety of solutions, including black holes, wormholes, and time-dependent spacetimes. Recently, EGB has garnered significant interest due to its crucial role in the study of cosmic expansion.",

INTRODUCTION\nMolecular motors play a crucial role in various biological processes, including muscle contraction, vesicle transport, chromosome segregation, and cell division. These motors convert chemical energy into mechanical work by binding to cytoskeletal filaments, such as microtubules, and moving along them. Kinesins are among the most extensively studied types of molecular motors, as they travel along microtubules toward their plus ends, while myosins move along actin filaments toward their minus ends. Both types of motors have been shown to exhibit discrete stepping behavior. Recent studies have revealed that both kinesins and myosins display stochastic stepping patterns even in the absence of external loads. This randomness is believed to arise from thermal fluctuations or internal noise. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding how these motors respond to external loads. To better understand the functioning of molecular motors, various theoretical approaches have been developed, including kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which provide valuable insights into their behavior.",

This framework allows us to derive a straightforward expression for the energy levels of the helium atom, as well as for the wave functions essential to these states. We demonstrate how this model can elucidate certain experimental results obtained from household spectroscopy experiments conducted at Jefferson Lab. Additionally, we explore the potential extensions of our modified model to other atomic systems, such as muonic atoms or those with a single valence electron. Helium has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. It has been identified that there are two stable isotopes, 3He and 4He, along with various excited states. These states have been investigated using various spectroscopic techniques, including photo-absorption, laser excitation, and Compton scattering. However, despite significant research efforts, there is still no clear explanation for why the ground state of 3He is unbound while that of 4He is bound. To address this discrepancy in helium's properties, we propose a theoretical framework in which the electron is characterized not only by its momentum but also by its position. This new approach enables us to analytically derive the energy spectrum of helium, as well as the corresponding wave functions. Our formalism is inspired by Bohmian mechanics, which describes particle dynamics along trajectories governed by the equations of motion.",

        "original_text": "We propose an improved metric on the space of worldsheet sigma model couplings that is suitable to study gradient renormalization group flows beyond first order in perturbation theory. The new metric has several advantages over previous proposals, including manifestly positive kinetic terms and no need for additional counterterms at higher orders. We show how this metric can be used to compute beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory using only Feynman diagrams with one-loop vacuum bubbles as building blocks. This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties. In addition we find evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the beta function of the string coupling constant.

This refined metric offers several advantages over previous approaches, including clearly defined kinetic terms and the elimination of the need for counterterms at higher orders. We demonstrate how this metric can be utilized to calculate beta functions up to third order in perturbation theory, relying solely on Feynman diagrams with one-loop bubble contributions as legitimate inputs. This approach has allowed us to derive results for the beta functions of the dilaton modified by the Ricci scalar, which align with findings from other studies but were previously inaccessible due to technical challenges. Additionally, we provide evidence for non-trivial structures present in the beta functions of the coupling constants.

A notable aspect of this approach is the potential to derive perturbative corrections to the WSSM directly from the path integral without needing explicit calculations involving gravitons or graviton loops. It has been suggested that the WSSM could also be employed to study the flow of effective couplings under the RG framework. However, due to the infinite degrees of freedom in the WSSM, there is no finite set of parameters where the RG flow can be easily defined. Instead, the RG flow must traverse a complex landscape of all possible actions. To facilitate progress in understanding these trajectories, it would be beneficial to establish a coherent metric on the space of WSSM configurations, allowing for comparisons between different couplings. Such a metric would enable us to determine whether two configurations are closely related or significantly different within the broader context of all possible WSSMs.",

We examine two distinct models for the system: (i) a local interaction that connects each site individually, and (ii) a global interaction that modifies all sites simultaneously. In both scenarios, we find that there are conditions under which the system can be transformed into highly entangled states, even when it begins in an unentangled or only weakly entangled state. This phenomenon occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise that influences the system's local interactions. The effects of local interactions are more pronounced than those of global interactions, as the former are essential for maintaining entanglement over longer timescales. Additionally, we demonstrate that these findings remain valid even when the environmental interactions exhibit some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum information processing requires the manipulation of quantum states over extensive distances. However, due to the unavoidable influence of the surrounding environment, such operations cannot be executed perfectly. In this study, we investigate whether certain types of environments can enhance the performance of quantum devices.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the wetting behavior of a system consisting of a liquid in contact with an attractive wall, utilizing a straightforward model that allows for precise calculations. The system is characterized by a fine balance between a strong repulsive force and a short-range attractive force that decays exponentially at larger distances. We demonstrate how to accurately differentiate the density profile near the wall, particularly as the interface transitions between the liquid and gas phases. Our findings indicate that true equilibrium is not achieved in the system as it approaches complete wetting by the liquid; instead, the interface becomes rough when the temperature falls below a critical value, T*. This roughness arises due to the exponential decay of the interaction potential, which leads to fluctuations in the number of particles adsorbed onto the wall. These fluctuations are responsible for the non-analytic behavior observed in both the density profile and the interface characteristics.\n\nIntroduction: Wetting occurs whenever two phases are in contact with one another. For instance, water droplets form on surfaces due to capillary forces, while oil spreads over water. The behavior of these phases can change significantly if one of them has a different dimensionality than the other. This phenomenon can lead to new wetting scenarios, such as those seen in systems where a thin film coexists with its vapor or in altered geometries. In this study, we consider a simple model to explore the wetting characteristics of fluids in contact with surfaces. Our results indicate that even though the interactions diminish rapidly with distance from the wall, they still give rise to complex behaviors. Specifically, we show that the presence of a wall induces fluctuations in the number of particles adsorbed on it. Consequently, the interface that separates the liquid phase (which contains all the particles) from the gas phase (which contains none) becomes rough when the temperature drops below the critical threshold, T*. Below this temperature, the average distance between the particles significantly decreases, resulting in a fractal structure.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe behavior of superfluid helium has been studied extensively since its discovery over fifty years ago. One of the most notable characteristics of superfluids is their ability to flow without dissipation or friction, which has led to various applications, including superconductors. Recently, ultracold atomic gases have been explored in optical lattices as a new avenue for investigating quantum fluids. These systems exhibit diverse phases, including Mott insulators, supersolids, and topological states. Additionally, they allow for continuous tuning of system parameters and provide direct insights into fundamental physical properties. This makes them ideal candidates for investigating phenomena predicted by theoretical models.\n\nIn particular, bosonic gases in optical lattices can form Bose-Einstein condensates, which behave similarly to superfluids. Recent experiments have demonstrated superflow and vortex formation in these systems. However, unlike traditional superfluids, the condensates in optical lattices also interact strongly with one another. Therefore, understanding how interatomic interactions affect collective excitations is crucial. In this study, we focus on 1D Bose-Einstein condensates confined by a varying potential. By solving the relevant equations, we aim to shed light on these interactions.",

For instance, while observational techniques allow us to measure the total mass of a galaxy cluster, it is challenging to determine how much of this mass is concentrated in galaxies versus the diffuse gas surrounding them. Additionally, although we can estimate the total gravitational influence of a galaxy cluster, it remains unclear how this mass is distributed among various components. Finally, while we recognize that a significant amount of hot gas exists within these clusters, it is uncertain whether this gas is gravitationally bound to the system. To tackle these questions, we will analyze two distinct datasets from the Chandra Observatory, including a sample studied by Vikhlinin et al.",

They have been extensively studied both theoretically and observationally over time. One significant aspect of their physics involves the behavior of matter as it approaches them, particularly those that can escape from the black hole's grasp. Recent research has revealed fascinating physical phenomena occurring very close to the event horizon. For instance, when considering a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, its trajectory is altered due to the so-called photon sphere. If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, it may fall into the black hole after emitting photons. Another interesting scenario arises when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole, where the dynamics are similarly affected by the presence of the photon sphere. However, unlike the case of a Reissner-Nordström black hole, the Kerr scenario involves not only photons but also gravitons. Much effort has been devoted to studying the dynamics of fields outside these black holes.

These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction.

However, this fact does not necessarily mean that all possible configurations can appear as ground states  2  . For example, the ground states of the one-dimensional chain are unique although its energy spectrum is continuous  3  , while those of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate  4  . \n \n Recently, several authors studied the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest neighbor Ising model (AN-NNI)  5 - 7  . They showed numerically that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on the square lattices if J 1 = J 2 or J 1 < J 2  7   . On the other hand, the ground states were shown to be unique on the honeycomb lattice  8  . These results suggest that the ground states might be nondegenerate even though their exact forms remain unknown so far. \n \n In this Letter, we investigate the ground states of the ANNNI model using Monte Carlo simulations. First, we confirm that the ground states are indeed infinitely degenerate on the squarelattice ANNNI models. Then, we examine whether these ground states are unique or not.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the floating components in the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI). Our findings indicate that there is no distinct phase for J1 = J2; however, a phase transition occurs when J1 > J2, which vanishes at a certain critical value of J1/J2. The transition between the two phases aligns with the universality class of the three-state Potts model, exhibiting a first-order transition. Additionally, we demonstrate that the ground states are degenerate on the square lattice when J1 = J2 or J1 < J2. This suggests that the ground states may be non-degenerate, although they have yet to be explicitly identified.\n\nIntroduction: It has been established since Wannier's work that the ground states of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice are infinitely degenerate. However, this does not imply that all possible configurations can serve as ground states. For instance, the ground states of the one-dimensional model are unique despite having a continuous spectrum, while those of the two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate. Recently, several authors have explored the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI). They numerically demonstrated that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on square lattices when J1 = J2 or J1 < J2. Conversely, the ground states were found to be unique on the honeycomb lattice. These findings imply that the ground states may be non-degenerate, although their specific configurations remain unknown.\n\nIn this letter, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the ground states of the ANNNI model. First, we confirm that the ground states are indeed infinitely degenerate on the square lattice ANNNI models. Next, we explore whether these ground states are unique or not. Finally, we discuss how the nature of the ground states varies with the values of J1/J2.",

This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 50571040. We would like to express our gratitude to Prof. Y. M. Wu for his assistance during this study. \n\nAbstract: In this study, we synthesized two types of polycrystalline composites, La2/3Ca1/3MnO3:Ag and La2/3Ca1/3MnO3:In, using the solid-state reaction method. X-ray powder diffraction analysis confirmed that the samples were free of impurities. Structural parameters such as lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and bond lengths were calculated from the XRD data. The DC magnetization measurements revealed that the Curie temperature (TC), critical current density (JC), and pinning force density (FP) increased with higher concentrations of silver or indium.",

While they have been extensively studied using advanced simulations, obtaining accurate data has proven challenging due to inherent complexities. These challenges arise because interfaces exist in a single dimension, making direct simulation difficult. Instead, boundary conditions must be carefully managed, which can lead to artificial interactions between images of the same interface. Consequently, the interfacial properties are highly dependent on the system's parameters. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding these interfacial phenomena.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) successfully explains most experimental data available today, but its validity has only been tested up to energies around 1 TeV. At higher energies, the behavior of particles may deviate from the predictions of the SM. To address such scenarios, one often considers extensions of the SM or models based on effective theories. Effective field theories provide a systematic approach to incorporate corrections due to new physics at energy scales beyond those currently explored. They allow us to calculate observables using perturbative techniques when the dynamics cannot be adequately described by standard quantum mechanics. This methodology is particularly useful in situations where there is no fundamental description of the physical phenomena under investigation. One notable example of an effective theory is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interactions among quarks and gluons. QCD predicts the behavior of hadrons composed of these particles. However, since the interactions within a hadron are much smaller than the energy scales typically considered in QCD, the dynamics can often be studied separately from the underlying theory. For instance, the production of heavy mesons and heavy flavors in high-energy collisions can be calculated using perturbative methods. Conversely, the interactions among partons can also be analyzed within this framework.",

Over the past decade, evolutionary game theory has been employed to model interactions among different species or individuals competing for resources. A common approach in these models is to consider a population of adaptive agents who choose among various strategies, followed by the application of mathematical tools to analyze the system's gradual behavior. In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate more complex models, including spatial structures and heterogeneous environments. However, much of the existing research has primarily focused on two-agent games, with less attention given to multi-agent systems. In this study, we present results that demonstrate that simple multi-agent systems exhibit richer dynamical behaviors than previously recognized.",

This interest arises from the observation that many complex physical systems exhibit behaviors characterized by features such as aging, intermittency, and other non-Markovian traits.

Our findings indicate that the presence of modified thinning results in significant changes in the predicted characteristics of the solid surfaces, as well as in the distribution of normal stress across the contact area, compared to predictions made using Newtonian models. Notably, we observe that the maximum value of the dimensionless pressure significantly varies when considering fluids with modified thinning properties. Additionally, our results suggest that incorporating modified thinning can lead to reductions in the dimensionless tangential stresses at the centerline of the contact region.

Introduction\nA notable characteristic of higher-dimensional theories is their ability to incorporate gravity into the framework of particle physics. This has led to significant interest in studying models that include supersymmetry. One such category of spacetimes is governed by warped product spaces, where the metric is expressed as ds² = e²A(y)(ημνdxμdxν + dy²), with y representing the extra dimension, A(y) being the warp factor, and ημν denoting the Minkowski metric. For instance, in the five-dimensional case, this reduces to the Randall-Sundrum model. Previous studies have shown that the presence of a nontrivial warp factor can influence various physical phenomena in the bulk, including modifications to standard dispersion relations, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and fermion localization. It has been established that the effects of the warp factor are significantly influenced by its behavior near the boundary of the extra dimension. If the warp factor decreases rapidly at infinity, all physical observables will align with those derived from conventional flat-space techniques. Conversely, if the warp factor does not vanish sufficiently, novel phenomena may arise.",

Recently, there has been a growing interest in miniaturizing these systems into lab-on-a-chip platforms, where functionalities such as sample preparation, differentiation, drug delivery, and bioassays can be integrated into a single device. Magnetic separators have gained attention due to their simplicity, low cost, portability, and compatibility with other microfabricated components. For instance, research groups have demonstrated the use of magnetic separation for biological samples within microchannels or on planar surfaces. Despite these advancements, current approaches face several limitations. Firstly, they often rely on batch processing, which restricts throughput and necessitates large input volumes. Secondly, existing methods typically address only the separation of two distinct cell types, while more complex mixtures cannot be effectively processed. Thirdly, the fabrication of multi-functional platforms remains challenging, hindering the integration of various functionalities. Lastly, most studies have been conducted under static conditions, which may not reflect optimal performance in dynamic environments.",

This represents the most precise measurement of this observable to date. \n\nIntroduction: Single transverse spin asymmetries have been studied in various processes involving polarized protons or neutrons, such as pion production, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan lepton pair production, prompt photon production, and direct photon production. These measurements provide insights into the internal structure of nucleons. They can also be used to test factorization theorems that connect hard scattering cross sections to partonic distributions within the proton. Additionally, these observables are crucial for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. For instance, recent studies suggest that large transverse spin asymmetries may arise from the interference of amplitudes with different helicities of quarks interacting with longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy collisions. Such effects challenge parity conservation and open avenues for new physics. However, there has only been one previous measurement of transverse spin asymmetries in hadronic dijet production at lower energies, specifically at RHIC, where the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision was √(sNN) = 200 GeV, significantly lower than our current study.",

        "rewrite_text": "We develop a hierarchical framework for understanding the reduced dynamics of premier quantum systems through a series of coupled equations, which we refer to as the Hierarchy of Density Tensors (HDT). The HDT is derived by applying the Nakajima-Zwanzig formalism to the von Neumann equations governing the total system. We demonstrate that this approach allows for the extraction of all pertinent information regarding the environment's influence on the decoherence process across arbitrary timescales. Specifically, it provides access to the spectral properties that characterize the decay of off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, as well as the stationary states achieved in the long-time limit. As a case study, we apply our formalism to investigate the dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model with Ohmic dissipation. Our findings are validated against numerical simulations conducted using the Quantum Monte Carlo Wavefunction method.\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nUnderstanding how macroscopic systems behave under the influence of their environments has been a central theme in quantum mechanics since its inception. This issue becomes particularly complex when addressing intricate many-body systems, such as those found in condensed matter physics or biological contexts, where the number of degrees of freedom can be exceedingly large. A theoretical approach to tackle these challenges involves studying the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the system of interest, conditioned on specific measurement outcomes over the relevant degrees of freedom. Recent efforts have focused on developing methods to derive the dynamics of the reduced density matrix. Among these, the Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) presents a promising alternative due to its ability to incorporate non-Markovian effects. However, despite its success in providing accurate predictions for short-time evolutions, the HDM has struggled to correctly capture the asymptotic behavior of the system. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced formulation of the HDM, termed the Hierarchy of Density Tensors.",

        "original_text": "We present an analysis of the ages derived by applying the gyrochronological method to a sample of open clusters with known ages (from literature) in order to assess its reliability as well as possible systematics associated with it. We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually.

Introduction\nStellar ages are crucial in various fields of astrophysics, from galactic studies to exoplanet research. Accurate age determinations are essential for understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, obtaining precise ages for stars can be challenging due to the complexities associated with their brightness and luminosity. For instance, while the ages of main-sequence turn-off stars can be estimated using photometric techniques such as theoretical isochrones and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods become less effective for stars in later evolutionary stages where convection plays a significant role. Additionally, although asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the internal structures of evolved stars, the interpretation of this data requires detailed modeling of each star individually. Consequently, alternative methods must be explored to estimate ages for large samples of stars across different evolutionary stages. Gyrochronology offers another approach for estimating stellar ages based on the rotation rate and magnetic activity of stars, which is influenced by dynamo processes occurring in the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003). It has been demonstrated that the Rossby number (Ro), defined as the ratio of the rotation period (P) to the convective turnover timescale, plays a significant role in this method.",

The Carter constant is a crucial invariant for geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter, 1968) and serves as a measure of the spacetime geometry near these objects, as its value can change significantly only when there is a deviation from axisymmetry at small radii (Bardeen, 1973; Thorne et al., 1986).

We also explore potential applications of our proposal and its implications for future developments. Spintronics has emerged as one of the most promising fields for information technology systems. One of the key challenges in this area is finding effective ways to control the flow of charge carriers without compromising their spin properties. To address this issue, research groups have recently explored the manipulation of magnetic textures, such as vortex states, skyrmions, and domain walls. Domain walls are particularly appealing because they can be controlled both electrically and thermally, making them excellent candidates for spintronic devices. However, despite significant progress in understanding the dynamics of domain walls, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the specific mechanisms that govern their behavior.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS \n\nThere has been significant interest in studying the intricate properties of the so-called Eden model. In its original formulation, it describes the growth of a cluster on a two-dimensional substrate, starting from a single site. This model has often been linked to various critical principles, as well as to shape transformations. We introduce a new generalization of the Eden model: instead of growing just one cluster, we consider the simultaneous growth of multiple habitats. Consequently, some sites may become trapped among others, leading to complex patterns of growth.",

To address this issue, numerous extensions of the SM have been proposed over the years.

Recently, they have been applied to various optimization problems, including image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. However, most solutions have focused on optimizing a single objective. In many real-world scenarios, there are multiple objectives to consider. For instance, in motion planning, it is essential to find optimal paths while minimizing computational costs; in autonomous driving, trajectories must be optimized under both kinematic and dynamic constraints; in healthcare, models should account for disease prediction as well as treatment recommendations; and in computational biology, optimization must address both protein folding and drug discovery simultaneously. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop methods capable of handling multi-objective optimization problems.

However, despite these developments, there remain persistent questions regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics that remain unanswered. Recently, researchers have sought to address some of these issues using concepts derived from statistical mechanics, such as entropy and information theory. These ideas were initially proposed within the context of classical thermodynamics but have recently been extended to the domain of quantum mechanics. For instance, one can consider the von Neumann entropy, defined as S = -Tr(ρ ln ρ), where ρ represents the density matrix of a system. This formulation captures the uncertainty inherent in measurement processes, and its time derivative, dS/dt, leads to the concept of the entropy production rate. It has been shown that this rate plays a crucial role in characterizing the irreversible behavior of closed quantum systems. Specifically, if the entropy production rate is zero, the quantum mechanical model exhibits reversible dynamics. Conversely, when the entropy production rate is positive, the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS The recent discovery of Majorana fermions has sparked experimental interest in the study of non-abelian anyons in condensed matter systems. One promising candidate for realizing such anyons is semiconductor nanowires, where they can emerge as zero-energy modes or as excitations bound to vortex cores. To experimentally realize these proposals, it is essential to understand the effects of interactions, electron-electron correlations, and various sources of decoherence on the stability of Majorana edge modes. Several theoretical studies have recently addressed these issues, focusing on the interplay of different physical mechanisms that influence the behavior of Majoranas in realistic experimental setups. A key concern is the role of interactions in determining the ground state of the system. Previous work has shown that repulsive interactions tend to favor the formation of a singlet state over a triplet state. Conversely, attractive interactions lead to the opposite scenario, promoting the emergence of a triplet state over a singlet state. These preferences have been established through theoretical analysis.",

Follow-up observations confirmed this event as a remarkable record holder among GRBs. Its photon count rate peaked at 2 x 10^4 photons s^-1 in the 15-150 keV range.

Our results provide insights into how different requirements can be managed within complex networks.

Ultimately, these factors determine whether a system will reach equilibrium. In this study, we focus on a specific type of non-equilibrium modified thermal percolation. Thermal percolation occurs when particles are incorporated into a network, allowing them to diffuse until they encounter one another. When two particles meet, their energies combine irreversibly, resulting in a cascade-like spread of particle density. As more particles come together, the size of the clusters increases. Eventually, these clusters merge to form a single, large cluster that spans the entire system. At this point, all particles have combined into one cohesive cluster. Recent studies have shown that the transition from a disconnected to a connected cluster is a critical transition. For instance, in random resistor networks, the transition temperature depends solely on the average resistance. However, if the resistance distribution is broad, the transition becomes first-order.",

It has been demonstrated that quantum entangled states serve as valuable resources for applications such as quantum teleportation, superdense coding, remote state preparation, and quantum key distribution. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring quantum entanglement in many-body systems.

These systems offer unique opportunities to investigate novel physical phenomena that do not occur in three-dimensional bulk materials. For instance, theoretical predictions and experimental observations have shown that carbon nanotubes exhibit unusual behavior even when their diameter is comparable to or smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another intriguing aspect of low-dimensional systems is that the requirements for various phases can change due to strong correlation effects. One of the key challenges in this field is understanding the intricate phase diagrams of these systems. It is important to note that the phase behavior is influenced not only by the filling factor but also by the specific material properties. Therefore, if we can manipulate the characteristics of these low-dimensional systems, we can anticipate the emergence of novel phases.

Our findings demonstrate that this method achieves O(n log n) time complexity for insertion operations, which represents an improvement over previous results by Chan et al., who established that these operations require at least Ω(n^(2/3)) time under certain conditions. The primary approach of our analysis involves employing amortized analysis techniques to limit the number of adjustments needed for the heap during each operation. This allows us to prove that the total cost across all operations is bounded by O(n log n). Additionally, we present experimental results that confirm our theoretical findings are tight up to constant factors.\n\nThe Fibonacci heap data structure was introduced by Fredman and Tarjan in 1986 as a means to enhance their work on efficient algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs), shortest paths, and other related problems. It consists of a collection of rooted trees, where each node contains two key fields: a pointer to its parent and a rank value. Each node points to its children, and unlike standard binary trees, multiple nodes can share the same key under any given parent node. Each node also maintains a rank counter that indicates how many nodes with keys less than or equal to its own key exist in its subtree; if no such nodes exist, the rank is set to zero. For instance, consider a Fibonacci heap that stores the values 1 through 5:",

Introduction\n\nWith the rapid advancement of wireless communication technology, there is a growing demand for enhanced efficiency and reliable transmission over limited resources.

Introduction\nThe synthesis of light elements in the universe is one of the most challenging problems in modern science. Since the 1960s, it has been established that photons can facilitate nuclear fusion processes leading to the formation of light elements such as deuterium (D), helium-3 (3He), helium-4 (4He), lithium-7 (7Li), and beryllium-9 (9Be). However, it is only recently that we have acquired sufficient knowledge about the physical conditions necessary for the synthesis of these elements. In extreme environments, temperatures (T) and densities (ρ) can reach values as high as 10^12 K and 10^15 g/cm³. These conditions are currently replicated in various experiments involving relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Nevertheless, due to the extremely short timescales involved, such experiments do not allow us to directly observe the conditions of the early universe. Instead, they provide insights into the properties of hot dense matter that may be relevant for understanding the nucleosynthesis processes occurring in supernova explosions. Conversely, the study of primordial environments, such as white dwarfs or metal-poor stars, offers valuable information that can inform our models of the early universe and the synthesis of light elements.",

Previous studies have suggested that quasars can trigger starburst activity in nearby galaxies through ultraviolet (UV) radiation and other interactions (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006). Recently, researchers have investigated the environments of high-redshift quasars using various wavelength surveys, including near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g., Adelberger & Steidel 2005; Venemans et al. 2007), radio continuum emission (e.g., Carilli et al. 2007; Overzier et al. 2008), and X-ray emission (e.g., Brandt et al. 2002; Gilli et al. 2003). However, most previous studies have focused on smaller scales (less than 1 Mpc) due to limitations in angular resolution or telescope sensitivity. On larger scales, some authors have reported evidence for large-scale structures associated with quasars (e.g., Kurk et al. 2000; Pentericci et al. 2007).",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of hadronic structure plays a crucial role in understanding the interactions between quarks and gluons within hadrons. Investigating parton distribution functions provides essential information about the spatial distribution of quarks and gluons inside hadrons. Recently, there has been significant progress in exploring the internal structures of hadrons beyond the leading-order level, particularly concerning the momentum-dependent parton distribution functions. In this context, we focus on another type of nonperturbative function: the distribution amplitudes (DAs). These amplitudes represent the probability of finding a quark-antiquark pair at a specific separation and momentum scale. It has been demonstrated that DAs play a vital role in various hard scattering processes. For instance, the decay constants fBπ and fBs can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs, while the dynamics of semileptonic decays such as B→πlνl and B→Klνl depend on both the lowest-order and next-to-lowest-order DAs.

We show that this setup can be used as a pump for electrons when the driving frequency matches twice the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states of the dot. In particular we find that the pump current exhibits sharp peaks whenever the Fermi level crosses a bound state inside the gap induced by the Coulomb interaction on the dot. The height of these peaks increases with increasing temperature T , which allows us to use our system as a thermometer. Finally, we discuss how our findings are modified if the driving amplitude becomes comparable or larger than the charging energy U . \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been growing interest in using periodically-driven systems as sources of coherent radiation  1  . This idea was first proposed more than twenty years ago  2  but only recently it became possible to realize such devices experimentally  3  .\nOne particularly interesting class of periodically-driven systems consists of those whose properties depend strongly on their internal degrees of freedom  4  . These so-called  quantum impurity models  have attracted considerable attention over the past few decades because they provide a simple description of many physical phenomena ranging from single-electron transistors  5  to heavy fermion compounds  6  . Recently, several groups have studied theoretically the possibility of using quantum dots  7, 8  and carbon nanotubes  9  as pumps for electrons  10  . However, most theoretical studies so far focused on non-interacting particles  11  while experiments typically involve strong interactions  12  .

        "rewrite_text": "We explore an adiabatic charge transport scenario in a quantum dot situated between two leads, where one lead is driven by a gate voltage that varies with time, while the other lead is grounded. Our findings indicate that this configuration can function as an electron pump when the energy levels of the dot are tuned to be twice the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states. We demonstrate that the pumping current exhibits sharp peaks whenever the Fermi level intersects a discrete energy level within the dot, influenced by Coulomb interactions. The intensity of these peaks increases with rising temperatures, leading us to propose that our system could serve as a thermometer. Additionally, we discuss how our results may change if the amplitude of the oscillations becomes comparable to or exceeds the charging energy. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing periodically-driven systems for various applications. This concept was first introduced over two decades ago but has only recently been realized in experimental settings. A significant class of these periodically-driven systems is characterized by their strong dependence on internal degrees of freedom. Quantum impurity models, in particular, have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to provide a simplified understanding of complex physical phenomena, ranging from quantum dot transistors to heavy fermion systems. Recent theoretical studies have investigated the potential of using quantum dots and carbon nanotubes for various applications. However, most theoretical work has focused on weakly interacting systems, while experimental studies often involve strong interactions. Thus, it is essential to explore systems that extend beyond the weak coupling regime. The goal of this work is to examine the effects of electron correlations on the performance of a quantum dot-based electron pump. To achieve this, we couple a quantum dot to two leads via tunneling. One lead is driven out of equilibrium by applying a periodic gate voltage, while the other serves as a reference electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 1.",

Our findings indicate that such systems can exhibit anomalously high values for their Young's moduli and Poisson ratios. The behavior of these materials is linked to the presence of phonon modes with periodicity along the film's normal direction. These results have significant implications for the development of novel materials with tailored elastic properties. Recently, there has been increasing interest in understanding how modifications at the nanoscale affect the physical behavior of materials. This issue naturally arises when considering nanowires embedded within bulk materials, and more generally, whenever a system is confined to components that are much smaller than its overall dimensions. For instance, this scenario is relevant during crystal growth when defects can be introduced into the structure by impurities, or when studying colloidal suspensions. In this context, we investigate a thin film with a periodic microstructure, whose thickness varies between two values, L and d (see Fig. 1). Here, L represents the dimensions of the unit cell, while d denotes the spacing between adjacent layers; both dimensions are significantly smaller than the in-plane dimensions of the sample. Such structures are found in various materials, including graphite, transition metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride. They also play a crucial role in various technological applications, ranging from photovoltaics to optoelectronics.

A particularly interesting application of these concepts involves examining non-conformal theories using their dual descriptions in terms of supergravity. To analyze such models, it is essential to solve the equations of the relevant supergravity or gauged supergravity theories. This task becomes more manageable when focusing on specific classes of solutions that preserve certain supersymmetries, as only a limited combination of fields is then involved. For instance, configurations that preserve all but one of the supersymmetries (BPS states) will depend on just five scalar fields.

INTRODUCTION** \n\nThe Dicke model describes the interaction of identical two-level systems with a single mode of electromagnetic radiation. There has been considerable interest in this model due to its relevance in quantum information theory, quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and more. For instance, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble is dependent on the total angular momentum \\( J = \\frac{N}{2} \\) (where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms). The Dicke model was originally proposed over fifty years ago. Since then, various theoretical approaches have been developed to analyze it. Among these, the Holstein-Primakoff transformation is one of the most effective, mapping the problem onto a spin-\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) system. This approach works well in the weak coupling regime, where the interaction between the atoms and the field is relatively small. However, it encounters limitations in the strong coupling limit due to the emergence of unphysical states. Recently, some authors have attempted to address this issue by introducing modified transformations or approximations, although their solutions still exhibit certain limitations.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nRecent experiments with quantum degenerate gases have opened new avenues for understanding strongly correlated systems. Ultracold atomic gases serve as model systems to explore phenomena such as fermionization, supersolidity, and Mott insulating states. In this context, we examine a specific class of experiments where the response of these systems to sudden parameter changes can be investigated. For instance, altering the strength of inter-particle repulsion or the density can lead to interesting dynamics before the system reaches thermal equilibrium. During this nonequilibrium phase, the system exhibits novel features such as dynamical scaling and non-thermal fixed points. These insights are crucial not only for our understanding of quantum matter but also for exploring new phases of matter. Recently, there has been significant interest in studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosonic systems. One intriguing aspect is when the system is driven to an excited state above the ground state. It has been shown that even when the system is far from equilibrium, it relaxes to a state described by a Gibbs distribution. However, if the initial state is deeply within the ordered phase, the dynamics may differ significantly.",

An edge e = (u, v) links vertex u ∈ V to vertex v ∈ V. If no such edge exists, then e is not included in E. A path P is defined as a sequence of distinct vertices v1, v2, …, vn such that vi−1vi ∈ E for i = 2, 3, …, n. A cycle C is a path where the first and last vertices are the same. A connected component is a subgraph H of G where any vertex in H can be connected to any other vertex in H by a path within H, but cannot connect to vertices outside of H. A clique K is a complete subgraph of G, meaning every pair of distinct vertices in K is adjacent. A k-clique is a clique consisting of k vertices. A vertex cover S is a subset of V such that every edge in G has at least one endpoint in S.",

Our findings indicate that the evolution is characterized by a chordal Schramm–Loewner process if the underlying graph is loop-free and has no multiple edges; otherwise, it is represented by a different type of Schramm–Loewner evolution. These results are derived using techniques from conformal field theory. We also demonstrate that the partition function of these models can be expressed as a correlation function of certain conformal fields within a specific conformal field framework. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the distribution of geometric features, such as winding around vertices, in the presence of interfaces. \n\nThe Schramm–Loewner Evolutions (SLE) were introduced by Schramm in 2000, who established that they represent a scaling limit of interfaces in critical statistical mechanics systems. Since then, SLEs have been extensively studied both theoretically and numerically, as evidenced by numerous works (e.g., KSS02, SS04a, SS04b, RS05, Sch06, CS07, KS08, KSV09, KM10, MS11, MZ12, BMS13, BS14, LW15, GKS16, GM17, GK18, HJ19, HK20, JPS20).

A compactly differentiable continuous function \\( S^{n-1} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) with harmonic components will be referred to as a harmonic function of degree \\( m \\). If the function has no zeros, it is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a constant. It follows that every spherical harmonic of degree \\( m \\) satisfies the following properties: (1) \\( |H(x)| \\leq 1 \\); (2) \\( H(-x) = (-1)^m H(x) \\) for \\( x \\in S^{n-1} \\); (3) Spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis.\n\nDefinition 1: A convex body \\( K \\in K_n \\) is said to be harmonic if there exists a non-negative integer \\( m \\) such that its surface area \\( \\sigma_K \\) satisfies...",

Introduction\nMining large volumes of streaming data has become increasingly important in recent years due to its relevance across various platforms, including online networks, social media analytics, regulatory compliance, and intrusion detection. However, the continuous nature of streaming data presents significant challenges, as traditional batch-processing methods are not suitable for real-time analysis. For instance, to detect anomalies in a continuous stream of tweets, one must continuously monitor all incoming messages and identify those that deviate significantly from normal behavior. To tackle these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques for analyzing streaming data. An emerging area within data mining focuses on discovering patterns from streaming data. A common task in this context is identifying frequent patterns in data. Another area of research involves identifying correlations between different attributes. These analyses are often conducted in conjunction with various regression and classification problems.",

In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z.

Additionally, we observe that the trend of red cloud galaxies becomes more pronounced at higher redshifts, reaching up to z ~ 2.5 - 3.0, while it diminishes beyond this range.

The key insight is that we can modify the Feynman-Kac formula to express the subtle projection value of the stress difference at a temperature T = 1 / k (where k is the Boltzmann constant) in terms of the values at zero temperature, but with one additional parameter related to the thermal fluctuations. We then demonstrate how this expression can be effectively derived by relating it to the Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in a periodic domain. This approach allows us to compute the vacuum energy and force within our computational framework, which involves solving the differential wave equation numerically on a structured grid. Our results are compared with those obtained using other methods, including analytic continuation into complex domains and the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA).",

Therefore, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly employed to calculate physical quantities using LQCD because they require positive definite weight functions  4  .\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, several approaches have been developed so far  5  -  8  . Among them, the Taylor expansion approach  9  -  11  seems to be very powerful since it allows us to evaluate the expectation value of any observables accurately within statistical errors.

Introduction\n\nLattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) is one of the most promising approaches for understanding the interactions between quarks and gluons, and it has been extensively used to calculate hadronic properties such as masses and decay constants. However, it faces the so-called sign problem: the fermion determinant \\( \\text{det} D_m = \\exp(-\\text{tr} \\{ D_m \\}) \\) changes sign depending on the gauge configurations, where \\( D_m \\) represents the Wilson-Dirac operator. Consequently, Monte Carlo methods cannot be directly applied to extract physical results using LQCD, as they require positive weights. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed. Among these, the Taylor expansion has proven to be particularly effective, allowing us to evaluate the expectation values of observables within statistical fluctuations. It also enables calculations at non-zero temperature and/or density. For instance, the Taylor expansion up to \\( O(a^6) \\) has been successfully implemented.",

In this talk I will discuss some recent results about lattice models that provide an alternative approach to studying these theories. The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms. Recently we developed new Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the worm algorithm that allow us to simulate large systems at very high temperatures where conventional Monte Carlo methods fail because they suffer from critical slowing down. We used our new method to calculate the free energies of several different supersymmetric lattice models including the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the N = 1 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory coupled to matter fields in various representations.",

        "original_text": "We consider the problem of designing distributed consensus algorithms in sensor networks where links are randomly generated and can be lost or added over time. We propose an algorithm that is robust to link failures, but requires only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm achieves global convergence under mild conditions on network topology. In particular, we show that if each node has at least one neighbor whose degree is greater than its own then our algorithm converges almost surely (a.s.) to the correct value. Our results also hold when there exists a small number of Byzantine nodes which may deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed behavior. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords: Sensor Networks; Distributed Consensus; Local Information Exchange; Robustness Analysis. 1 Introduction Distributed consensus problems arise naturally in many applications such as flocking  1  , formation control  2  , multi-agent coordination  3  , wireless sensor networks  4  , etc.. A typical example is the average-consensus problem: given a set of n agents connected by communication links, each agent holds some initial data xi(0) ∈ Rm, i = 1, ..., n; it aims to compute the average x̄=1/n∑in=1xi(0).

The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*.

The observed relationship between EPC, temperature, and film thickness suggests that phonon dynamics play a crucial role in determining the characteristics of EPC in these modified materials. Manganese oxides have been extensively studied due to their diverse physical properties, such as colossal magnetoresistance, metal-insulator transitions, and charge ordering. Among these, La1-xSrxMnO3 has garnered considerable attention due to its intriguing properties. In this compound, manganese ions occupy two distinct sites: Mn3+ in a tetrahedral configuration and Mn4+ in an octahedral configuration. It has been observed that the magnetic ground state transitions from a ferromagnetic insulator to an antiferromagnetic insulator as the value of x increases. These transitions have been attributed to the interplay between double exchange and superexchange interactions. However, there are still some unresolved questions regarding the nature of the insulating states in these materials, particularly concerning the mechanisms responsible for their insulating behavior.",

The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. A pre-procedural CT scan was obtained without intravenous contrast medium injection. Using OsiriX MD software, two urologists delineated the kidney contour and identified all visible calices. Subsequently, they projected their findings onto the live fluoroscopic images during the procedure. They were asked to perform punctures into each calyx that could be visualized on fluoroscopy. After successful puncture, stone removal was attempted through the sheath inserted via the needle. Successful puncture was defined as reaching at least one calix. Overall success rate was 88%. No complications occurred related to the use of the US puncture tract projections. This technique may help urologists to achieve safe and efficient percutaneous renal access even if only few calices are clearly seen on fluoroscopy.",

        "original_text": "The quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects on the dynamics and decoherence of semiconductor-based qubit systems are investigated in this work. The QED effect is described by an effective interaction between the qubit system and its environment, which consists of vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field as well as thermal photons at finite temperature. We show that the QED effect can be treated perturbatively for typical experimental parameters. In particular, we find that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free space modes increases with increasing number N of electrons involved in the qubit state. This leads to faster relaxation times T 1 , but also to stronger pure dephasing rates T 2 . For realistic values of N = 10 − 100, however, these effects remain small compared to other sources of relaxation such as phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Quantum information processing has attracted considerable attention over recent years due to its potential applications in various fields ranging from communication technology  1  to metrology  2  .

A key challenge in data compression is predicting the optimal file size while maintaining the quality of uncompressed data. This challenge is commonly referred to as rate-distortion analysis. The rate-distortion function characterizes the relationship between the average codeword length and the distortion level achieved by any optimal coding scheme. The most widely used approach to address rate-constrained optimization problems is Lagrangian optimization, which transforms constrained optimization into unconstrained problems by introducing Lagrange multipliers. However, solving these problems typically requires iterative methods, which can be computationally intensive. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various techniques. Nevertheless, these methods often experience reduced efficiency when applied to large-scale problems.",

It has been established that if one only considers classical fields, it becomes impossible to construct a consistent model based on this idea due to the emergence of ultraviolet divergences. This issue was addressed by Snyder, who proposed a novel type of coordinate transformation leading to a deformed Poincaré algebra. In order to explore physical models with these modifications, researchers have examined scenarios where the commutator between two spatial coordinates, \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\), is proportional to \\(i\\theta_{ij}\\), depending on certain parameters. Such deformations result in alterations to the standard dispersion relations and affect the propagation characteristics of matter fields. For instance, recent studies suggest that introducing a minimal length scale could provide insights into the black hole information paradox. Additionally, it is possible to choose the deformation parameters such that their effects diminish rapidly with increasing distance. Consequently, the impact of noncommutativity is expected to be negligible outside a localized region around the origin, indicating that the noncommutativity of modified models primarily influences local phenomena while leaving global properties unchanged.",

Recent experiments have demonstrated how delicate quantum systems can evolve from their ground states while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external parameters. In this context, we examine scenarios where the system is quenched across a phase transition. For instance, if the system is initially confined in a harmonic trap, it will expand freely once the confining potential is removed. Alternatively, the system could start in its ground state before undergoing a rapid change in another parameter, such as a magnetic field. In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will significantly depend on whether the system was initially close to equilibrium or not. If it was not, the system will relax into a metastable state, the properties of which cannot be inferred from those of the equilibrium state.",

        "rewrite_text": "The authors present an experimental method for determining the requirements for two photons hitting pixels in a detector, as well as its spatial characteristics. This method focuses on measuring correlations between pairs of photons emitted from a source with a specific angular distribution. It is applicable for characterizing various types of photon detectors, such as CCD cameras and photomultipliers, without needing detailed knowledge of their internal workings. This information can then be utilized to assess the performance of imaging systems like telescopes. The results pertain to silicon strip detectors and demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/aa5e20.\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**  \nIn many applications, accurately determining the position where a photon strikes a detector is crucial. This information is particularly important when designing advanced instruments such as telescopes. To evaluate the spatial characteristics of a detector, we need a reliable reference against which we can compare our measured data. One effective way to obtain this reference is to position a known source that emits photons at specific angles relative to the detector. If the detector lacks intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will originate from a small area around the point of incidence on the detector's surface. By adjusting the detector over different measurement angles, we can analyze the distribution of detected photons and determine the response function R(θ) of the detector. Understanding this response function allows us to assess the spatial resolution of the detector. However, if there is more than one pixel per detection area, the analysis becomes more complex, as multiple pixels may register a single photon. To address this issue, we introduce a concept of joint probabilities P_ij, which represent the likelihood that the i-th and j-th pixels detect a photon simultaneously. By applying this concept alongside the response function, we can enhance our understanding of the detector's performance.",

        "original_text": "The observed smallness of the vacuum energy density is one of the most puzzling problems in physics today, and it has been suggested that this problem may be solved by considering quantum gravity effects on the vacuum fluctuations.  In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately. This result suggests that our approach provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem. The observed smallness of the cosmological constant poses one of the greatest challenges facing modern theoretical physics  1  . It is generally believed that quantum gravity will play an important role in understanding why the vacuum energy density associated with quantum fluctuations of all fields is so much smaller than what would naively be expected  2  .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to address this issue within the framework of loop quantum gravity  3  -  8  , but none of them seem to provide a satisfactory answer  9  .

        "rewrite_text": "The remarkable smallness of the cosmological constant is one of the most perplexing issues in contemporary cosmology. It has been suggested that this problem cannot be resolved by merely examining quantum fluctuations in the vacuum. In this paper, we demonstrate how such a phenomenon can naturally emerge within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We propose a model in which the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques, while matter fields are treated classically. The effective Hamiltonian includes terms that explicitly depend on the cosmological constant and its derivatives. These terms introduce corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. By applying these modified equations to observational data, we find that the small value of the modified cosmological constant aligns well with observations if the parameters are appropriately chosen. This outcome suggests that our model provides a viable solution to the cosmological constant problem. The observed smallness of the cosmological constant presents one of the significant challenges in modern theoretical physics. It is widely believed that quantum gravity will play a crucial role in explaining why the vacuum energy density, influenced by quantum fluctuations of all fields, is much smaller than one would naively expect. In recent years, there have been attempts to tackle this issue within the context of loop quantum gravity; however, none have provided a satisfactory resolution. Furthermore, the results from previous studies do not consistently agree with one another or with current observational constraints. Here, we present a framework based on ideas recently discussed in the literature. Our approach begins with the observation that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, derived from the canonical formulation of general relativity, leads to modifications of the Schrödinger equation when applied to states of macroscopic systems. As demonstrated in prior work, these modifications can be interpreted as arising from the presence of additional degrees of freedom associated with the gravitational field itself.",
