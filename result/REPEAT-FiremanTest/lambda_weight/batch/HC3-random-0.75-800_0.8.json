These writings were then collected and stored over history , and they provide a history of God s interactions with people in the past . This means that the Bible is a historical document that told the tale of God s role with people , rather than a direct line of communication from God to us today .

The wind inside the runners pushes back up against the road , and this allows to keep the automobile from sinking down too far into the road . Air is a very good substance for this because it is good to compress and expand easily . When a wheel rolls over a bump in the road , the atmosphere inside the wheel can compress a bit bit to absorb some of the impact . This allows to make the journey more comfortable for the people inside the drive . There are some hard parts that could likely be used to make tires , but they would not work as good as air . For e , a tire making of hard rubber would be very hard and would not be could to absorb shocks as good as a tire filled with air . It would also be far heavier , which would make the automobile use more fuel to move ."}]}}

I d be happy to assist you realize how to properly estimate the subnet mask of a network . First , let s begin with the basics . A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets. It works by split the IP account of a device into two parts : the network part and the host part . The subnet mask depends which part of the IP number belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host . Now , let s think you want to create subnets for a network with the IP number spectrum 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . To do this , you require to decide how several subnets you want to create and how several services you get on each subnet . For n , let s think you get to create 4 subnets , each with 16 hosts . To approximate the subnet mask , you would do the following : Write down the number of subnets and hosts in binary shape . In this way , you use 4 subnets , so you would write 100 in binary . You write 16 instances , so you would write 10000 in binary . Add the two binary numbers together. In this use , the sum is 100010000 . Convert the binary number to decimal shape . To do this , you would multiply each number by the respective power of 2 and add the results . In this use , the decimal result of the binary number is 320 . Write down the IP location list in dot - decimal notation . In this use , the IP address spectrum is 192 . 168 . 1 . 0 to 192 . 168 . 1 . 255 . Add the subnet mask to the IP name . To do this , you would mix the subnet mask ( 320 ) with the IP name using dot - decimal notation . The resulting IP number might be 192 . 168 . 1 . 320 . This is the simple technique for calculating the subnet mask of a network . I hope this helps to justify the notion ! Let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification ."}]}}

P2P loan structures , such as Lending Club , connect borrowers and lenders immediately , and the network functions as a facilitator by handling the underwriting , servicing , and collection of the debt . Here s how the P2P loan program typically functions : Borrowers application for a loan on the P2P loan site by submitting information about their creditworthiness , income , and the purpose of the loan . The website assesses the borrower s creditworthiness and assigns a risk rating to the loan . Lenders browse the available debt on the portal and identify the ones they plan to invest in model on the borrower s risk rating and other factors , such as the loan amount and effect price . Once the loan is fully funded , the portal disburses the money to the borrower and starts making contributions on behalf of the lenders . The lenders pay periodic pay as the borrower repays the loan , and the P2P loan site collects a charge for its services . P2P loan can be a useful and also profitable way for persons to give money and pay greater returns than they might get from traditional income , such as savings deposits or military bonds . It can also be a useful means of financing for borrowers who could not collect for a loan from a traditional lender . However , it is key for both borrowers and lenders to cautiously examine the risks and likely drawbacks of P2P loan , such as the risk for default or other debt risks ."}]}}

While savings savings can be a good way to set aside money for the later , they do not provide the same grade of monetary protection as life insurance . There are two main types of life insurance : general life insurance and permanent life insurance . Term life insurance is a class of insurance that provides insurance for a specific duration of year , such as 10 , 20 , or 30 decades . If you die during the life of the plan , your beneficiaries will get the death benefit . If you outlive the life of the plan , the program will expire and you will not get any benefit . Term life insurance is generally less cheaper than temporary life insurance , but it does not build money value over history . Permanent life insurance is a class of insurance that provides insurance for your whole life , as length as you retain to pay the premiums . Permanent life insurance policies also have a savings component , which allows you to build money value over later . This money value can be used to pay premiums or can be withdrawn or borrowed against . Permanent life insurance is generally more cost than general life insurance , but it provides lifelong insurance and the ability to build money value . I think this would solve the difference between life insurance and savings savings , as also as the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance . Let me see if you have any other questions ."}]}}

Light is a kind of energy that passes through distance and it is the fastest everything in the universe . It can go at a speed of about 300 , 000 miles per moment , which is really quick ! Now , let s discuss about universe . A galaxy is a massive group of stars , gas , and material that are held together by gravity . There are billions of universe in the universe , and each one is really far back from us . In actually , some universe are so far apart that it takes a far longer for their light to reach us . When we look at a galaxy that is far apart , we are actually saw it as it was a far way earlier . This is because it takes a hard light for the light from that galaxy to reach us . So , if we see a galaxy that is 30 billion light decades apart , it means that it took 30 billion centuries for the light from that galaxy to reach us . But the universe is only about 16 billion centuries old , so how can we see a galaxy that is 30 billion light hours apart ? The answer is that the universe is constantly growing . This means that the distance between universe is getting bigger all the way . As the distance between universe comes bigger , the distance between them also comes bigger . This means that even though the galaxy might not be 30 billion light decades back from us now , it was when the light leaving the galaxy and started traveling towards us .
