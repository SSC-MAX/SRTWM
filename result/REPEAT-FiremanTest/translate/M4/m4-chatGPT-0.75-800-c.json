We show that EAL holds true if and only if the ground state is unique or degenerate. For non-degenerate ground states we prove that there exists an infinite family of pure product states which are arbitrarily close to the ground state but cannot be obtained by local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC). This implies that the amount of distillable entanglement can be strictly smaller than the von Neumann entropy of the ground state. Finally, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this phenomenon may occur even when the ground state is unique. The results presented here provide further insight into the nature of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Entanglement plays a crucial role in various applications ranging from quantum information theory  1  , condensed matter physics  2  , and statistical mechanics  3  . In particular, it has been shown  4  that the ability to create maximally entangled pairs of qubits via LOCC is equivalent to the existence of Bell inequalities  5  .\nIn recent years much attention was devoted to understanding how entanglement behaves under different physical conditions  6  .

        "original_text": "We propose an efficient numerical scheme to solve the nonlinear dynamics of semiconductor microcavity lasers with arbitrary pumping profiles and cavity losses, which is based on the combination of two different truncation schemes. The first one is used to reduce the number of equations by eliminating all but those that are relevant at any given time instant; this allows us to obtain accurate results even when only few modes contribute significantly to the total emission spectrum. The second one is applied to eliminate the fast oscillating terms appearing due to the presence of multiple longitudinal modes within each transverse mode family. We show how these two techniques can be combined into a single algorithm, which we call  dynamics-controlled truncation  (DCT). Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by comparing it against other existing methods. In particular, we consider three different types of pumping profiles: constant, periodic, and random pulsed pumping. \nI. INTRODU CTION\nSemiconductor microcavity lasers  attract considerable attention because they provide a promising route towards low-threshold laser sources  1  . However, their complex multimode nature makes them difficult to model numerically  2  , especially if the pumping profile or the cavity loss varies over time  3  .\nIn order to overcome such difficulties, several authors have proposed various approaches  4  -  8  . For example, in Ref.  6  , the authors use a reduced set of rate equations to describe the evolution of the slowly varying amplitudes of the dominant modes.

        "original_text": "We study the second-order correlation function for an atom interacting with two modes of light, one resonant and another off-resonant to atomic transition frequency. We show that higher order antibunching can be observed when the atom is initially prepared in an excited state or ground state superposition. The effect is more pronounced if the initial state has some population on the excited state. This phenomenon may have applications in quantum information processing. \n \n Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying nonclassical properties of radiation fields generated by atoms  1  . In particular, it was shown that the photon statistics of such systems are governed by the first-order coherence function g (1) (τ)  2  , which describes bunching behavior at short times and anti-bunching at longer times  3  . It is well known that this property arises due to destructive interference between different pathways leading to emission of photons  4  .\nRecently, several authors studied the effects of spontaneous emission on the second-order correlation functions  5  -  8  . They showed that the presence of spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics  6 - 8  . However, these studies were restricted only to the case where the atom interacts with a single mode of field. On the other hand, many experiments involving atoms interacting simultaneously with multiple modes of electromagnetic field have also been performed  9  -  11  .

The main structural unit in keratins is an alpha-helical coiled coil that forms microfibrils with other similar units to form intermediate filaments (IFs). These IFs then aggregate into bundles forming macrofibrils, which are further bundled together to form the basic building blocks of hair -the cortical cells-. In this work we have studied how the mechanical properties change as these structures evolve during the process known as maturation or ageing. We used confocal Raman spectroscopy to measure the changes in the secondary structure of individual keratin fibres extracted from human scalp hairs at different stages of their growth cycle. Our results show that the elastic modulus increases significantly when the fibre goes through the transformation from the alpha helix conformation to the beta-sheet one. This increase can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between neighbouring strands of the protein backbone.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

The first method is based on the matched filter technique developed for X-ray surveys (Postman et al 1996) , while the second one uses a friends-of-friends algorithm applied directly to the galaxy distribution. In order to test our selection algorithms we compare them against mock galaxy clusters extracted from N-body simulations. Our main results are as follows:  1. Using the matched filter technique we find that the number density of galaxy clusters at z < 0.5 is n(z<0.5) = 3.6 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 h3 Mpc-3 .

We find that neglecting the porosity of the wind leads to an overestimate of the mass loss rate by up to two orders of magnitude compared with our results. This is because the density contrast between the dense clumps and the interclump medium increases as one moves out into the wind, leading to more absorption at large distances than would be expected if the wind were smooth. The effect becomes stronger when the wind velocity decreases or the metallicity increases. \n \n Keywords: Stellar winds, Radiation hydrodynamics, Line-driven winds, Porosity, Clumping \n \n Hot stars lose mass through their stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines (Castor et al., 1975; Abbott & Lucy, 1985) . In order to understand how these winds are structured it is necessary to solve the coupled equations of radiative transfer and fluid dynamics simultaneously. However, this problem has proved extremely difficult to solve numerically due to its multi-scale nature - both spatially and temporally - which requires very high resolution grids to resolve all relevant scales correctly. As such, most previous studies have used simplified treatments of either the radiative transfer or the fluid dynamics, but not both together. For example, some authors assume that the wind consists entirely of optically thin gas (e.g. Friend & Castor, 1983) while others use simple prescriptions for the radial dependence of the optical depth (e.g. Pauldrach et al., 1986) , or even ignore the effects of opacity altogether (e.g. Lamers & Cassinelli, 1999 ) . Other authors make simplifying assumptions about the flow itself, e.g. assuming spherical symmetry (e.g. Puls et al., 1996 ) , steady state (e.g. Owocki et al. , 1988 ) and/or stationarity (e.g. Runacres & Owocki , 2002 ) . \n \n Here we present new calculations for the structure of line-driven winds",

We find that there are two distinct modes of solar magnetic field evolution over this period.

We show how this can be achieved by defining a set of views for each node in the decision tree model being learned. These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent s training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL). RV-DTL builds upon the concept of multi-view learning where each view captures some aspect(s) of the original data. More specifically, our approach defines a set of views for every internal node in the decision tree being built.

INTRODUCTIO N\nIn many applications it is important to know how accurately one can determine the position where a photon hits a detector. For example this information is needed when designing optical instruments like telescopes  1  . In order to measure the spatial resolution of a detector we need to have some reference point against which we compare our measured data  2  .\nOne way to obtain this reference point is to use a light source emitting photons at a well-defined angle relative to the normal direction  3  , see Fig.  1(a) . If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will come from a small area around the center of the detector surface. By scanning the detector over different angles θ, we can find out what fraction of the total number of counts comes from each part of the detector  4  . We call these fractions the response function R(θ) of the detector  5  . Knowing the shape of the response function allows us to calculate the spatial resolution of the detector  6  .

This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical.

The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions.

Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 .

Although CSMA/CA allows multiple stations to share the same radio channel simultaneously without any centralized coordination, it suffers from poor system performance when the traffic load increases  5  .

This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1).

The former is realized for 0 < n < 1 while the latter appears at half-filling with spin degeneracy lifted. In addition to these ordered states we also observe an exotic state where electrons form pairs without any net charge. This paired state can be regarded as a precursor of superconductivity.

Introduction:-In recent years much attention has been paid to the physics of low dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes  1  , semiconductor nanowires  2  , quantum wires  3  etc..

For example, it was predicted theoretically  5  and observed experimentally  6  that carbon nanotubes show metallic behavior even though their diameter is comparable or smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another interesting feature of low dimensional systems is that various kinds of electronic phases may appear due to strong correlation effects  7, 8  .\nOne of the most important issues in this field is how to control the electronic phase diagram of low dimensional systems. It should be noted here that the electronic structure strongly depends not only on the geometry but also on the chemical composition  9  . Therefore, if we could change the chemical composition of low dimensional systems, then we would expect new electronic phases to emerge.

        "original_text": "We present an explicit expression for the irreducible form of the metric variation of the action term in sixth order gravity, which is valid to all orders in perturbation theory. We also show that this result can be used to derive an approximate expression for the stress energy tensor of the gravitational field. The results are applied to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during inflation driven by a scalar field with non-canonical kinetic term. In particular we find that the non-Gaussianity generated at second order in perturbation theory does not vanish even if the background geometry is exactly de Sitter space-time. This implies that the bispectrum produced by such models cannot be described solely in terms of local shape functions as it was previously thought. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest on higher derivative theories of gravity motivated mainly by their possible role in quantum gravity phenomenology (see e.g. ), but also because they provide interesting alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in the context of modified gravity scenarios . However, despite these efforts, our understanding of the physical consequences of these theories remains incomplete due to technical difficulties associated with the analysis of their solutions. One of the main obstacles comes from the fact that the equations of motion derived from these actions contain derivatives of arbitrarily high order, making them difficult or impossible to solve analytically. A way out of this problem consists in expanding the fields around some fixed background solution and truncating the resulting series expansion after a finite number of terms. Although this approach allows one to obtain useful information about the dynamics of the system under consideration, it fails to capture important features like back-reaction effects between different modes of the same field or interactions among different fields. For example, in the case of inflationary cosmologies based on higher derivative gravity, the truncated perturbative expansions do not reproduce correctly the observed level of primordial non-Gaussianities .\nA more systematic method to deal with these problems involves the use of covariant techniques developed originally within the framework of GR. These methods allow us to express the equations of motion in a manifestly gauge",

        "original_text": "We study mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrents flowing through two weakly coupled superconductors with different transparencies and temperatures, using the Usadel equations for quasiclassical Green s functions. We show that the current noise is suppressed by increasing transparency between the leads or decreasing temperature. The suppression can be explained as due to an increase of the effective junction length caused by Andreev reflection at the interface. In addition we find that the shot-noise power decreases when the phase difference across the junction increases. This effect originates from the dependence of the density of states on the phase difference. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments performed on diffusive SNS junctions. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe Josephson effect describes macroscopically coherent transport of Cooper pairs across weak links connecting two superconducting electrodes  1  . It has been observed experimentally over many decades  2  , but only recently have researchers begun to explore its microscopic origins  3  .\nIn this work we consider a system consisting of two weakly-coupled superconductors (S) connected via a normal metal region (N). Such systems are known as diffusive SNS junctures  4  . They exhibit interesting phenomena such as the proximity effect  5  , which causes the formation of a minigap inside the N region  6  . Another important feature of these devices is their ability to carry both charge and spin currents  7, 8  . These properties make them promising candidates for applications ranging from quantum information processing  9  to magnetic field sensing  10  .\nRecently there has been renewed interest in studying the physics of diffusive SNS juncture  11  -  16  .

The proposed DFA scheme is based on the concept that each node can directly vote its local decision with other nodes  decisions and then obtain final global decision by majority voting rule. In order to reduce communication overheads caused by direct voting process, our scheme adopts two novel techniques: 1) only one-hop neighbors are allowed to cast their votes at any time instant; 2) all nodes use different time slots to transmit their votes simultaneously. We also present theoretical analysis to show how much energy consumption will be saved compared with existing schemes.

It also enables us to perform calculations at high temperature and/or high density  12  -  14  . For example, the Taylor expansion up to O(a6) has already been performed successfully  15  .",

This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases.

We consider two different scenarios depending on whether or not there is feedback information available at transmitter side. In both cases, we derive closed-form expressions for average end-to-end distortion as well as its upper bound under Rayleigh flat-fading channels. The results show that when there exists no feedback link between source node and destination node, the optimal power allocation strategy depends only on the instantaneous channel gain. However, if there are some feedback links to provide the knowledge about the current channel state, then it can be shown that the optimal power allocation strategy also depends on the past channel states.

Among them, power control has attracted much attention because it allows us to adjust transmit power according to varying channel conditions so as to maximize the data rates while maintaining acceptable quality-of-service  9  .

In addition, the transmission coefficient increases with increasing stress at low bias voltage but decreases at high bias voltage. This behavior can be explained as follows. At low bias voltage, the increase of transmission coefficient results mainly from the reduction of barrier height due to compressive stress. However, at high bias voltage, the decrease of transmission coefficient comes from two factors: one is the increase of effective mass induced by tensile stress; another is the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction caused by tensile stress.

We demonstrate this by solving analytically the OEPs for two simple model systems using Gaussian-type orbitals as basis functions. The results obtained within both approaches differ significantly. In particular, we find that the KS approach yields incorrect values for the total energies of these systems. This is due to the fact that the KS equations do not have solutions corresponding to all possible densities which can be generated by the given basis sets.

Since then, many theoretical models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon  4–9  , among them the so-called two-fluid model  10  . According to this theory, there exist two different types of charge carriers in these materials, namely electrons and holes  11  . These particles interact via attractive Coulomb forces  12  and form Cooper pairs  13  . When the material undergoes a phase transition below its critical temperature Tc, the Cooper pairs condense into a superfluid state  14  . This leads to macroscopic quantum phenomena such as zero resistance  15  and Meissner effect  16  . \n \n However, it was soon realized that the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory  17  cannot fully account for all experimental observations  18  . For example, the BCS theory predicts that the energy gap between the ground-state and excited states should decrease rapidly near T = 0 K  19  . On the other hand, recent measurements  20  indicate that the energy gap remains almost constant down to very low temperatures  21  . To overcome this problem, several extensions of the original BCS theory were developed  22–24  . Among those theories, one of the most successful ones is the Eliashberg formalism  25  , where the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role  26  . It turns out that",

As a result, the ionization front may become unstable against small perturbations which lead to its fragmentation into several blobs or fingers. These blobs are surrounded by dense shells of neutral material produced by photo-evaporation of the surrounding medium. In addition, we show that the mass loss rate increases significantly for large values of the index n of the power law density distribution.

The CBA is used as a dispersive readout device for the quantronium, and we show that it can be operated at high bandwidths without significant back-action noise or added phase noise. We demonstrate measurement times up to 1 ms per data point while maintaining quantum-limited sensitivity. This allows us to perform measurements over many relaxation cycles of the system, which are necessary to extract information about its dynamics. In addition, we use this technique to study the effect of different environmental conditions on the coherence time of our system. Our results indicate that the CBA has great potential for future experiments studying open quantum systems. Quantum mechanics predicts that macroscopic objects such as atoms will exhibit wave-like behavior when they interact with light fields. However, these predictions have not been experimentally verified because measuring the properties of individual particles requires extremely sensitive detectors. Here, we present a new method for detecting single photons based on a nonlinear optical process known as parametric down-conversion. Using this approach, we detect single photons emitted by a trapped atom interacting with a laser field inside a high-finesse optical cavity. By coupling the output of the cavity into a second cavity containing a nonlinear crystal, we generate pairs of entangled photons whose frequencies differ by twice the frequency of the pump beam. These photon pairs are then detected simultaneously by two silicon avalanche photodiodes operating in Geiger mode.",

The main result is that we find evidence for two different populations of radio halo sources which are separated by their radio powers. In particular, our analysis shows that there exists an upper limit to the radio power of radio halos hosted by massive galaxy clusters. This suggests that the energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the synchrotron emission decreases rapidly beyond this threshold value. Our findings also suggest that the magnetic field strength increases with increasing radio power.
