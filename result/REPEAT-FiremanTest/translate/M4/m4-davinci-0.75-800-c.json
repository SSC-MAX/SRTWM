Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors.

In addition we detect narrow emission features which are likely due to interaction between SN ejecta and this wind.

The main idea behind our proof is to use amortized analysis techniques to bound the number of times we have to update the heap s size during each step of the algorithm. This allows us to prove that the total cost incurred over all steps is bounded by O(n log n). In addition, we also provide experimental evidence showing that our theoretical bounds are tight up to constant factors. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Fibonacci-heap data type was introduced by Fredman and Tarjan  FT86  as part of their work on efficient algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs), shortest paths, and other related problems. It consists of a rooted binary tree with two additional fields associated with every node: its parent pointer and its rank value. Every node stores pointers to its left child and right child nodes; however, unlike ordinary binary trees, there can be more than one node with the same key stored under any given node. Each node maintains a counter called its rank, which indicates how many keys equal to or less than the key of the current node exist below it; if no such key exists then the rank field contains zero. \n \n For example, consider the following Fibonacci-heap storing the values 1 through 5:",

These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio",

We find that the scaling laws observed in incompressible flows are violated when the Mach number becomes large enough to produce shocks. In particular, we show that the energy spectrum exhibits an exponential decay with wavenumber k instead of the power-law behavior E(k) ~ k-5/3 predicted by Kolmogorov s theory.

        "original_text": "We present an analysis of synthetic stellar libraries used to calibrate photometric surveys, such as Gaia and LSST. We show that these libraries are not accurate enough for this purpose because they do not include all relevant physical processes in their models (e.g., convection). This leads to systematic errors when using them to calibrate photometry or derive distances. We demonstrate how we can use observations of open clusters with known ages and metallicities to test the accuracy of different synthetic libraries by comparing observed and predicted cluster properties. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on current synthetic libraries. The next generation of space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented amounts of data about our Galaxy. These new datasets require large efforts to be analyzed properly. One important aspect is the calibration of photometric surveys like Gaia and LSST which will deliver precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky. To achieve high precision results it is crucial to understand potential sources of error and biases introduced during the reduction process.

We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations.

        "original_text": "The question is not new, but it has been recently revived by the publication of two papers in Nature and Science that claim to show that biodiversity loss leads to ecosystem collapse.  The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.   They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.    In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.  We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity s greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1–3. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4–6. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7–10, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11–13. A number of theoretical models suggest that biodiversity loss will cause reductions in ecosystem functioning14–16. For example, Tilman et al. (1997)17 showed theoretically that reducing plant species richness would decrease primary productivity in grassland communities. Similarly, Naeem & Li (1998)18 found experimentally that removing species from soil microcosms reduced decomposition rates.

We find that this leads to an additional term in the action which is proportional to the volume form of S5, but does not affect any other fields or equations of motion. The resulting solution has a non-vanishing dilaton at infinity, corresponding to a deformation of the conformal symmetry group by a scale transformation. This can be interpreted as giving rise to a mass gap for all states except those transforming trivially under the unbroken SO(4) subgroup of SU (4). In particular we show how this mechanism allows one to generate masses for all gauge bosons without breaking supersymmetry. We also discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction: It was shown recently  1  , using the gauged linear sigma model approach  2  , that it is possible to deform the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (MSYM) theory in 4-dimensions such that only the vector multiplets acquire masses while preserving N = 1 supersymmetry.

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect.

The lack of any spectral evolution across this break suggests it was caused by energy injection into the blast wave. We find no evidence for dust extinction along our line-of-sight; however we cannot rule out significant reddening due to host galaxy dust. Our results are consistent with previous claims that achromatic breaks observed in many other bursts may be explained as being due to late-time energy injections rather than jet-break effects. \n \n Keywords: Gamma-ray burst, Afterglow emission, Energy injection, Jet break, Redshift measurement \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how gamma ray bursts (GRBs) produce their broadband electromagnetic radiation. This effort has led to several successful models describing the prompt phase of GRB emission (see e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but less progress on explaining the origin of the afterglow component. A key feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or  jet break  in the light curve around one day postburst (Rhoads 1999) . Such breaks have traditionally been interpreted as marking the time when the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, causing the flux density to drop rapidly.

For example, Chen et al.  12  introduced a modified BGK-type collision term which recovers the correct equilibrium state while satisfying the second law of thermodynamical. Similarly, Yu et al.  13  developed another type of entropy-consistent LB schemes using the concept of entropic moments. More recently, Shan et al.  14  presented a novel LB model where the relaxation time was determined according to the local Knudsen number. Although these works provide promising results, they all require additional information about the macroscopic variables, e.g., pressure and velocity fields. As a result, their applications may be limited to simple cases involving only one component gas. \n \n In contrast, we propose here a general framework for constructing entropy-consistent LB models.

This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry.

We show that this leads to an optimal height for the barchan dunes in agreement with observations. The results are presented below. \nThe authors thank Jens Egeberg Hansen (University of Southern Denmark) for useful discussions. Sand transport occurs when grains are lifted up into the air due to aerodynamic forces exerted by the wind. This process can be described as saltation  1  , where individual particles jump across the surface before being deposited again. Saltating particles transfer momentum to the surrounding fluid through collisions  2  . In turn, these collisions generate turbulence  3  .\nSaltation also causes erosion  4  and deposition  5  . Erosion takes place if the net force acting on a grain is directed away from the ground  6  . Deposition happens if the net force acts towards the ground  7, 8  . These processes lead to the formation of bedforms such as ripples  9  or dunes  10  . Dunes are formed under conditions where the sediment supply exceeds the rate of removal  11  . They occur naturally  12  but they may also form artificially  13  . Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped structures  14  . Their shape has been explained theoretically  15  and observed experimentally  16  .

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes.

We show that in this case it is possible to obtain accurate results using only two parameters instead of three as was previously thought necessary (the third parameter being the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the shell s thickness). The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration. This makes our approach much faster than previous methods while retaining high accuracy. Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth s crust to tectonic stresses and other processes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition. It also has applications in geophysics beyond Earth sciences including planetary science, astrophysics and seismology. \nTheory\n\nIn order to study the deformation of the Earth s crust we need to know how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate boundary interactions like subduction zones and transform faults.

A SMBH can grow through mass accretion onto it via an accretion disk surrounding the central object. Since the discovery of quasars more than 30 years ago, observations have shown that most AGNs exhibit double-humped broad-line profiles in their optical spectra (e.g.,  1; 2 ), indicating that they contain rotating accretion disks  3  . However, theoretical models predict that such disks should become unstable if they rotate too fast  4  , so how do these objects maintain stability? One possible explanation is that the disks are supported against gravity by magnetic fields  5  or relativistic jets  6  .\n \nIn this Letter, we study the properties of accretion disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations including both gas pressure and radiation pressures as well as self-gravity  7–9  . Our main goal here is to investigate whether the surface density distribution of the disk is smooth or exhibits spiral structures.

In this note we discuss possible interpretations of these data within the framework of quantum field theory and string theory. We argue that the most natural interpretation is to assume that the observed effect arises due to new particles coupling to photons via an effective dimension-8 operator.

Our approach is to use a special type of graph called a tree decomposition which allows us to decompose our original problem into smaller problems in such a way that we can efficiently sample from these smaller problems using existing techniques. In particular, we show how to construct a tree decomposition of any input graph G = (V , E) by first constructing a tree decomposition of its line graph L(G). Then, we prove that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm A that solves one of these small subproblems then it also implies the existence of a polynomial time algorithm B that solves all of them simultaneously.

        "original_text": "We report on the absorption spectrum of an isolated single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) in solution, obtained by using a scanning near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and illuminated through one electrode at normal incidence to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. We observe that the TE mode is strongly suppressed compared to TM polarization due to the presence of metallic tubes within our sample. This effect can be used as a spectroscopic tool for identifying the chirality of individual SWNTs. \n \n Single-wall carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit unique electronic properties which depend sensitively on their diameter and chiral angle  1  . In particular, it has been shown theoretically  2  , experimentally  3  , and numerically  4  that the energy gap depends on these parameters such that semiconducting tubes have small gaps while metallic tubes have large ones. However, this dependence is not sufficient to uniquely identify all possible tube types  5  .\n \nIn order to determine the type of each tube individually, several experimental techniques have been developed  6  -  8  . For example, Raman scattering  9  or photoluminescence  10  measurements allow one to distinguish between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the intensity ratio of certain peaks  11  . Alternatively, electrical transport experiments  12  provide information about the charge carrier density and mobility  13  .

Our approach relies on measuring the absorption cross section of individual SWNTs  16  . Since the absorption cross-section depends on the dielectric function  17  , which in turn varies significantly depending on whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting  18  , we expect different values for the absorption cross sections of metallic versus semiconducting tubes. By comparing the measured absorption cross sections of various tubes, we will show how this technique can be used to classify them into either metallic or semiconducting categories. \nExperimental setup\n\nThe samples were prepared following the",
