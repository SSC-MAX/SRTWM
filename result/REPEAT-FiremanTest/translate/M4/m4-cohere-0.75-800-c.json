For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated.

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation.

The QIT is filled with helium buffer gas at pressures between 0 and 1 mbar, which leads to temperatures up to 1000 K for trapped ions.

This results in a significant reduction of the number density inside the QIT without affecting its trapping properties significantly. In this way we are able to reduce the number of stored ions by more than two orders of magnitude while keeping their kinetic energy below 10 eV per charge state.

        "original_text": "The electrostatic interactions between two asymmetrically charged membranes are studied by using the mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that there is an attractive interaction between these membranes, which can be explained as follows. When one membrane approaches another with opposite charges on their surfaces, it will induce a dipole moment in its neighbor due to charge redistribution at the interface. This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases. Finally, our study shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force depends strongly on the surface charge density difference between the two membranes.

We find that, for typical parameters relevant to high-power laser-plasma experiments, SBS is dominated by electrostatic Langmuir wave instabilities rather than ion-acoustic modes. The latter are suppressed due to Landau damping as well as mode conversion into electromagnetic radiation at oblique angles with respect to the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that the effect of ion trapping can be neglected if the density fluctuations associated with the trapped ions are small compared to those caused by the electrons.

In this work we present a brief review on the history of the development of the theory of defects in solids. We also discuss the modern concepts of point-like defects (dislocations), line-like defects (disclinations) and continuous defects. Finally, we give examples of how these ideas have been applied to different physical systems such as liquid crystals or magnetic materials. Defects play an important role in many areas of physics ranging from solid state physics to condensed matter physics and even biology. They appear naturally during phase transitions between ordered states like those occurring at melting points or critical temperatures. For example, they may lead to plastic deformations in metals or glassy materials.

Enhancer activity is often cell-type specific and regulated by the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs).

Here we show that cooperative interactions between two distinct classes of TFs play an important role in regulating enhancer activity during lytic infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a large double-stranded DNA virus.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK .\nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most important mysteries of modern physics  1  -  4  .

There exist many theoretical models describing DM  11  -  13  ; however, none of them has yet been confirmed experimentally  14  . One of the possibilities is that DM consists of new elementary particles  15  -  17  . If they interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter then they would escape detection even if they were produced in large quantities  18  . On the other hand, if they interact strongly enough with normal matter, then they may be detectable directly  19  -  21  . A number of experiments searching for DM particles have been carried out  22  -  26  . Recently, the results obtained by the DAMA collaboration  27  attracted considerable attention  28  -  30  . According to these results, the annual modulation effect  31  -  33  caused by the motion of Earth around Sun  34  -  36  leads to an increase in the rate of nuclear recoils registered by detectors during June-October period  37  compared to December-February period.

The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today.

These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet.

We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with free-slip boundary conditions using a spectral element method to simulate the flow field around the evolving droplet shape. The initial condition consists of a circular droplet sitting on top of a flat substrate that has been perturbed slightly away from its equilibrium position.

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al. (2008) used SDSS DR4 data to investigate the alignments between galaxy spin vectors and their nearest neighbor s position angles. They found no",

The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years  1, 2  .

Finally, it recombines with the parent ion emitting a photon whose energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy lost due to tunneling  9  .

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest on higher derivative theories of gravity motivated mainly by their possible role in quantum gravity phenomenology (see e.g. ), but also because they provide interesting alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in the context of modified gravity scenarios .

The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ).

On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such evolutionary processes, the black holes could acquire large amounts of angular momentum via tidal interactions and/or",

        "original_text": "We study the decoherence of macroscopic quantum superposition states in open systems, and show that it is possible to prepare such states with high fidelity using current experimental techniques.  We consider two different types of macroscopic superposition: coherent spin states (CSS) and Schrödinger cat states (SCS). For CSS we find that the decay rate scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles involved in the state. This scaling law can be understood by considering the effect of spontaneous emission on each particle separately. In contrast for SCS the decay rate scales as $1/sqrt(N)$ which cannot be explained by treating individual particles independently. Instead we argue that this behavior arises due to collective effects between all particles in the system. Finally, we discuss how these results could be tested experimentally. Decoherence of macroscopic superposition states has been studied extensively over recent years  1–3  . It was shown theoretically  4  , and confirmed experimentally  5, 6  , that macroscopic superposition states are extremely fragile against environmental noise  7, 8  . The main reason behind their fragility lies in the fact that they involve many particles, so even small interactions with an environment lead to rapid loss of coherence  9  .\nIn this work we focus on studying the decoherence process of macroscopic superposition in open systems.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of gamma rays lasting only milliseconds, were discovered over thirty years ago but their exact cause remains unknown. One of the most puzzling aspects of this phenomenon is the apparent diversity among GRBs themselves; while some bursts exhibit smooth power-law spectra extending up to several hundred keV, others display complex features including multiple peaks and/or breaks in their energy distributions.

However, only about 10% of all known planetary systems contain such massive objects. Most of these have been discovered through high-precision Doppler spectroscopy or direct imaging methods. In contrast, very few low-mass companions have been found so far because they produce smaller reflex motions and/or lower luminosity than their more massive counterparts. As a result, there exists a large gap in the distribution of masses among known extra-solar planets ranging from several Earth masses down to Neptune-like masses. It is therefore important to search for low-mass companions as well since they can provide valuable information regarding the formation process of planetary systems. \n \n One possible way to detect low-mass companions is to use high-angular resolution observations made with space-based telescopes like HST. Such observations allow us to measure the position angle of the host star relative to its nearby neighbors. If we assume that the observed motion is due solely to gravitational interaction with another body then we can derive the projected separation and position angle of the companion. By combining these results with accurate radial-velocity measurements taken simultaneously, we can obtain the full three-dimensional orbit of the companion which allows us to calculate its mass.",

We find that there are two types of shallow decays with different physical origins.

However, we show that this scenario cannot explain all cases of shallow decays. In particular, it fails to account for those shallow decays occurring at late times when the external shock emission should have faded away completely. For these events, we propose another explanation -the second type of shallow decays-which may arise from the transition between the relativistic fireball phase and non-relativistic ejecta-dominated phase. This new interpretation naturally explains why some shallow decays occur only at late times while others appear both early and late during the afterglow evolution. \n \n Keywords: Afterglow, Energy injection, Fireball model",

        "original_text": "We present an analysis of the ages derived by applying the gyrochronological method to a sample of open clusters with known ages (from literature) in order to assess its reliability as well as possible systematics associated with it. We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories.

We have used HST/WFPC2 images taken through filters F555W and F814W to search for Cepheids among young open clusters located within these galaxies. Our survey has resulted in the discovery of four new Cepheids in NGC 3109 and one in WLM. These five Cepheids are all short-period classical pulsators with periods ranging between 4.5 days and 8.6 days.

Introduction \n \n Open clusters provide an important tool for determining extragalactic distances because they contain many stars at nearly identical ages and chemical compositions. In addition, open clusters can be found over a wide range of galactocentric radii, allowing us to probe different environments.

We find evidence for two distinct components to this filamentary structure; one component has a relatively low column density but extends over several degrees on the sky while another component appears more compact and denser.

We show that for any given initial state, there exists an optimal set of input nodes such that if their states are fixed at 1 or 0, then the resulting system will reach its steady state with minimum number of steps (or equivalently maximum speed). The problem is formulated as finding this optimal set of input nodes by solving a combinatorial optimization problem on graphs. This formulation leads us to develop efficient algorithms based on local search techniques. Our results provide insights into how to design effective control strategies for complex systems modeled by Boolean networks. In addition, we also investigate the effect of noise on the performance of these control strategies.

These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.   They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.    In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.  We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity s greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1–3. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4–6. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7–10, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11–13. A number of theoretical models suggest that biodiversity loss will cause reductions in ecosystem functioning14–16. For example, Tilman et al. (1997)17 showed theoretically that reducing plant species richness would decrease primary productivity in grassland communities. Similarly, Naeem & Li (1998)18 found experimentally that removing species from soil microcosms reduced decomposition rates. These predictions were supported by numerous subsequent empirical studies19–22.",

This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension—simple versus complex, slow versus fast, unstable versus stable—the total number of possible combinations would be four (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), which corresponds to eight types of living matter.

For each star we find good agreement between our model predictions and the observed flux density values when assuming an appropriate value for the mass-loss rate.

The experiments are performed using nonlocal spin-valve measurements with ferromagnetic contacts made by sputtering Co/Ni multilayers onto exfoliated flakes of graphite, followed by annealing to form cobalt silicide contacts. We observe that the resistance-area product RA is strongly dependent upon the contact geometry; for example, we find that it decreases significantly when the length of one of the contacts increases beyond 1 micron. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of disorder scattering near the interface between the metal and the carbon atoms. In addition, we show that the magnitude of the spin signal depends sensitively on the relative orientation of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnets. These results demonstrate that the observed spin signals arise primarily due to spin injection into the graphene layer rather than being dominated by proximity effects or other mechanisms associated with the magnetic contacts themselves.",
