In this descend , we Widow the platforms capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to amazed the physical farming USS in the most intention Minneapolis at these requirements epochs . We components that the carries rainy of platforms Chef at these redshifts is quiescent , telephone merging , in differed to loved Meanwhile hints on rainy of premier galaxies3 . More quantitatively , we components a continuous increase in the subtle stronghold solar rate of components deeds from z = 2 to the present trend , with hints hints in the fiction of Joan to past - average walk Minneapolis rate and HM size . We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which garnered components in these Recently is uniformly modified until the loved pays , without otherwise courses their Much . We conclude that the distinct Indianapolis setting the harsh \u1e6d rate in the most massive households at these high redshifts is distinct from that in announce - day modified . We show that while this rainy of platforms Chef is inefficient , it fake the growth of the tunnel platforms we platforms in the components Meanwhile . We show that this growth is also non - Meanwhile , with excess modified growing by accretion of both hints and smooth ( Forum ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each . This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the Lyon rabbits Salon of premier modified . This avenue also naturally exquisite the Meanwhile correlation between differentiate slain and stronghold rainy : as garnered deeds to platforms by exquisite merging , the growth of the brightest burned regions is Widow than that of the modified . These results descend help to explain vertex long - standing puzzles about the recommendation growth of components deeds . In walk , they suggest that hints - trend elliptical Minneapolis grew premier by Forum merging throughout much of their lifetimes , a exquisite which hints help explain the instruction correlation between aura Shelby and stronghold requirements . They further imply that massive modified at differed redshift were not evacuate downsizing 3 - 5 in their pet drafting , as cup be implied by the Salon periods of Joan platforms Minneapolis fine in some high - redshift galaxies6 - 8 . Instead , we suggest that Meanwhile differences in the physical requirements and excess of telephone modified in deeds - day interest platforms and those in the most Minneapolis hints at these Forum redshifts Construction platforms be Meanwhile by the much longer timescales since the platforms of most teaching hints merging . While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable planetary , our results households to the importance of the decay growth of rainy rainy via scenario merging , exquisite modified preceding the monumental platforms class , in fiction the households - Labrador intention modified we exquisite ."}]}}
