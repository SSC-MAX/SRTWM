        "original_text": "The observed smallness of the vacuum energy density is one of the most puzzling problems in physics today, and it has been suggested that this problem may be solved by considering quantum gravity effects on the vacuum fluctuations.  In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe critical Casimir effect  1  , i.e., the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions, has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically  2  -  4  and experimentally  5  . It was shown  6  that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation  7, 8  or wetting  9  .\nIn particular, the critical Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films  10  where it leads to the appearance of additional forces  11  responsible for the formation of stable droplets  12  . These effects have been observed recently  13  in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps  14  . However, most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate  15  -  17  . This simplification is justified only if the thickness of the film d is much larger than the range of interaction potential between atoms of the fluid and the surface  18  . For example, in case of 4 He films adsorbed on graphite substrates  19  the typical values of these parameters are  20  : r 0 ≈ 3Å, d ≈ 10 − 100 nm. Therefore, taking into account the substrate explicitly is necessary  21  especially close to the wetting transition  22  .",

It relates states that differ only in their charge but have identical masses. In particular it implies that the strong decay widths of charged and neutral pions should be equal. However, this equality has been experimentally tested down to pion momenta as low as 1 MeV/c and deviations up to 20% were found  1  .

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect. Finally, we discuss how our results could be tested observationally using current data on distant supernovae.",

For example, they could provide fuel for active galactic nuclei through gas inflow into the center of the host galaxy (Shlosman et al. 1990 ). On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies. Therefore, theoretical investigations of the dynamical behavior of nuclear bars will help us understand how these objects evolve over time. \n \n 2 Previous Work \n \n Several previous works studied the stability of nuclear bars in elliptical galaxies.

In addition we show how these parameters can be constrained by fitting the full spectrum of an unresolved galaxy. This work was performed within the framework of the ESA Gaia mission. Keywords: Galaxy evolution; Stellar populations; Spectroscopy. 1 Introduction Galaxies are complex systems whose properties depend strongly on their mass, age, chemical composition, star formation history, and environment. These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight. Therefore, accurate measurements of all relevant physical parameters require detailed spectroscopic observations covering large wavelength ranges. Such studies are now possible thanks to new space missions like GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, Hubble Space Telescope, and most importantly, the upcoming European Space Agency s Gaia satellite.

Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2.

More formally, let us consider an interactive protocol between Alice and Bob consisting of two phases:  The first phase consists of a series of rounds during which Alice sends qubits to Bob who performs measurements on them according to his choice of measurement bases. At the end of each round, Bob announces publicly whether he accepts or rejects the received state. If Bob accepts at least half of all states sent by Alice then the second phase begins; otherwise, the protocol ends after the current round. During the second phase, Alice reveals her secrets to Bob if he accepted enough states in the previous phase. Otherwise, both parties abort the protocol. It was shown in  4  that such a proof system exists if and only if there exist one-way functions. However, no explicit construction of such proofs has been known until now.",

The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields.

We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted experiments with two different OODB systems, O2 and ObjectStore. Our experimental results show that our model provides accurate estimations of the response times of both OODB systems under various workloads.

We show that these amplitudes can be obtained by evaluating certain correlation functions on the worldsheet boundary, which are related to tree-level gauge theory amplitudes via holography. The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states. These arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincare transformations; they correspond to corrections to the supergravity action induced by higher derivative terms in the bulk effective field theory. \nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence  1  relates type IIB superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) to conformal field theories living on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been used extensively over recent years as a tool to explore non-perturbative phenomena in quantum gravity  2  . It also provides a novel approach to studying strongly-coupled gauge theories such as QCD  3  .\nIn this talk we will consider the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence -the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N=4 SYM) theory  4  , whose dual description involves type IIA strings moving in AdS 5 × S 5  5  . At weak  t Hooft coupling λ = g 2 Y M N ≪ 1, where g Y M denotes the Yang-Mills coupling constant, perturbative calculations have shown that the two descriptions match exactly  6  . However, it remains unclear how to calculate quantities like scattering amplitudes directly within the gauge theory at large values of λ  7, 8  .

The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today.

The input consists of n points on the plane with integer coordinates bounded by B. We want to find a point that minimizes its distance to all other points. This problem has been studied extensively since it was introduced by Helly in 1930s. In this work we propose a new branch-and-cut algorithm based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. Our MIP model uses O(nB) variables and constraints. Using our proposed cutting planes, we can reduce the number of nodes explored during search significantly. As a result, our algorithm runs faster than existing algorithms when the dimension d = 2 or 3. For example, if the dimension is two, then our algorithm solves instances with up to 1 million points within 10 minutes while previous best known results are limited to 100 thousand points.",

The results are compared to those obtained numerically using exact diagonalization techniques. In particular, it is shown that the AAEI leads to a significant increase of the concurrence between nearest-neighboring spins when compared to the standard XXZ case. Moreover, we find that there exists a critical value of the anisotropy parameter beyond which no entanglement survives. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be tested experimentally.

These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent s training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL).

The decrease occurs because the pressure gradient becomes smaller when moving outward due to the decreasing density.

The method is based on a decomposition into spherical harmonics and can be applied to any function that has been expanded as such.

As examples we apply our technique to calculate correlation functions of CMB temperature fluctuations and to compute power spectra of simulated galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of these methods to higher-dimensional spaces. Wavelets have become popular tools for analyzing various types of data sets ranging from images to time series. In cosmology they were first introduced by Bond & Efstathiou (1987) who showed how they could be used to efficiently calculate angular correlations of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Since then many authors have employed wavelets to study different aspects of large-scale structure formation including the evolution of dark matter haloes (e.g., Colombi et al. (1998) ), gravitational lensing effects (e.g., Jain et al. (2000)), weak gravitational lensing statistics (e.g., Schneider et al. (2002)) , and the clustering properties of galaxies (e.g., Percival et al. (2003)). However, all previous studies focused exclusively on flat space where it was straightforward to define wavelets using translations and dilations of mother wavelets. This situation changes dramatically when considering three-dimensional data sets like those obtained with modern astronomical instruments. Here, the concept of translation becomes ambiguous because there exists no unique way to identify corresponding points at different locations within the sample volume.

        "original_text": "The present work is devoted to the study of photon wave mechanics in terms of position eigenvectors, which are introduced as solutions of the Schrödinger equation for photons with an arbitrary energy spectrum. The concept of position eigenvector allows one to describe the state of a single photon by its position probability density distribution function (PDF). It also enables us to introduce the notion of quantum trajectory describing the evolution of this PDF over time. In particular, we show that the quantum trajectories corresponding to different initial states can be obtained from each other by means of unitary transformations. We demonstrate how these results may be used to analyze various phenomena related to the propagation of light through dispersive media. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our approach to the description of nonclassical effects associated with the emission of entangled pairs of photons. DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/aa5e20\nI.

The proposed model consists of two parts: one for describing the hydrodynamics inside the gasifier; another for representing the thermochemical processes occurring at different locations along the reactor axis. In order to investigate how these interactions affect the system stability, we perform linear analysis on both parts separately as well as their combined effect. It is found that the thermochemical process can be stabilized if the residence time of particles in the reaction zone is sufficiently large. However, this may not always be possible due to practical constraints such as high temperature requirement or limited space available. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using realistic operating conditions to verify our theoretical results.

The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time  1  . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski  2  who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

The exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear; however it has been suggested that pulsations play a key role.  In this work we present new observations of two evolved intermediate-mass stars with very different pulsation properties to investigate how their pulsational behaviour affects mass-loss rates. We find evidence that the star with higher amplitude pulsations loses more material than its less-pulsating counterpart. This suggests that high amplitudes may be required to drive significant mass loss during the AGB stage.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity.

This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields.

For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

The comparison between observations and theory shows that we can exclude one set of frequencies at high confidence level but not the other. This is due to the fact that the frequency differences between ℓ=0 and ℓ=2 modes depend strongly on the inclination angle.

However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio",

The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts.

It is possible that many optically-faint quasars are hosted by less-massive systems such as late-type spirals and/or low-luminosity ellipticals (e.g., Hao et al. 2005). \n \n To understand how supermassive black holes grow over cosmic time, it is important to study both unobscured and obscured active galactic nucleus (AGNs) across a wide range of environments. However, identifying heavily-absorbed AGNs is difficult due to the lack of strong spectral features associated with them. One way to identify absorbed AGNs is through their X-ray properties. For example, Compton-thick AGNs are characterized by very flat X-ray continua and large equivalent widths of iron Kα fluorescence lines (EW>500 eV) (see e.g., Risaliti 2002). Another method is based on the fact that absorbed AGNs tend to exhibit higher X-ray-to-optical flux ratios compared to normal galaxies (e.g..",

The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches.

We use our model to predict the late-time behaviour of these GRB afterglows and compare it with observations made by Swift/XRT.

The DNP effect was studied by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at X-band frequencies using a home-built high-field spectrometer equipped with a commercial microwave bridge operating at 2.5 GHz. We found that the enhancement factor increases strongly when approaching the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature TNI = 35 °C. This finding can be explained by assuming that the molecular mobility decreases rapidly as TNI is approached.
