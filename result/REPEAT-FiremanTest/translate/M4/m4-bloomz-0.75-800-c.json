We show that the QD ordering is determined by two competing mechanisms: surface diffusion and strain relaxation. The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening. In particular we find that for small values of the QD size dispersion there exists a critical value of the growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be formed. This result explains why it has been so difficult to grow ordered QD arrays with large QD sizes using conventional techniques. \n \n Keywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs), also known as colloidal quantum dots, have attracted considerable attention due to their unique optical properties  1  . They can be used in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes  2  , lasers  3  , solar cells  4  , photodetectors  5  , etc., and they may even play important roles in biological systems  6  .\n \nThe most common method for growing QDs is based on the so-called Stranski-Krastanov process  7, 8  . It involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate at high temperatures followed by annealing at lower temperatures. Under these conditions islands nucleate randomly over the entire sample area but then evolve into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening  9  . However, this technique does not allow one to control the position of individual QDs within each array  10  .

The rate at which this happens depends on how much gas there is available for collapse.   In turn, the amount of gas available for collapse depends on the balance between inflow (from larger scales) and outflow (from smaller scales).   This talk will discuss recent work that has been done using numerical simulations to understand these processes better.

Star formation takes place when dense gas clouds collapse under their own gravity into bound objects called protostars.

During this process, gravitational energy is released as radiation and kinetic energy, heating up surrounding material and driving powerful winds and jets.

The main focus is on the development of new algorithms for computing accurate estimates of the power spectrum of signals defined over the surface of the unit sphere using only partial information about these signals. In particular, we consider two classes of methods: those based on the use of spherical harmonic expansions and those based on wavelet transforms. Finally, we briefly describe several open research questions related to the topic discussed here. Spherical data arise naturally in many areas of science including astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, geodesy, and medicine. For example, astronomers routinely collect large amounts of data describing the positions of celestial objects such as stars or galaxies; similarly, weather forecasters gather measurements of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., at various locations around the globe.

In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Strömgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field.

Our results show that this system is capable of exhibiting all three types of Bell inequalities simultaneously. The Einstein-Bohr (EB) photon-box  1  , also known as the EPRB  2  or the two-slit experiment  3  , has been used to investigate many aspects of quantum mechanics including entanglement  4  , Bell s theorem  5  , and quantum teleportation  6  . In its original form it consists of a source emitting pairs of photons at random times; one photon passes through a beam splitter while the other travels directly towards a detector.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  .

The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states.

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone.

        "original_text": "We present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts.

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

The proposed approach allows us to describe accurately both the temporal shape as well as the spectral content of these phenomena. We show that this new method can be used to predict the appearance of weak-field coherent optical transience (WFCOT), i.e., the generation of sub-femtosecond bursts of light with high peak power at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of the pulse. This prediction is confirmed experimentally using a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond oscillator operating at 800 nm central wavelength. Finally we demonstrate how our results are relevant for applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy or attosecond science. \n \n Optical precursors have been observed since the early days of ultrafast optics  1–3  .

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe.

For example, while current observational techniques allow us to measure accurately the total amount of light emitted by a galaxy cluster, it remains difficult to determine how much of this light comes from stars inside individual galaxies versus diffuse gas located outside them  5  . Similarly, although we can estimate fairly well the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster using various methods  6  , it is not clear what fraction of this mass is associated with visible objects like galaxies  7, 8  . Finally, even though we know that galaxy clusters contain large amounts of hot plasma  9  , it is unclear whether this material is gravitationally bound to the system  10  .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we will use two different datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory  11  : the sample of galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et",

If the initial data have compact support we prove that the solution remains uniformly bounded on any finite time interval  0,T . Finally, under some additional assumptions about the initial data, we establish the exponential decay of solutions at infinity. The results obtained here generalize those known previously only for the case when the pressure p(ρ) = ρ γ , where 0 < γ ≤ 1.1.

The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ). For example, the presence of a massive accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter constant even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr 1963). \n \n Previous studies have shown that the orbital evolution of binaries with non-spinning components is affected by the black-hole quadrupole moment Q = M(1 − S2)/c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999) . However, these effects become negligible once the black holes reach their final plunge phase due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence.

        "original_text": "We introduce the notion of an algebra over a monoidal category and show that it is equivalent to the notion of a coalgebra in the dual category, which we call a comonoid.  We then define the cyclic homology of such algebras as the Hochschild cohomology of their underlying comonoids with coefficients in the bimodule given by the tensor product of the algebra with its opposite algebra.  This definition generalizes the usual one for ordinary algebras over fields or rings.   In particular, if the base ring has characteristic zero, this recovers the classical definitions of cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology.  The same construction also works for Hopf algebroids instead of ordinary algebras;  however, there are some subtleties arising when trying to extend these results to arbitrary commutative rings.    Finally, we give several examples illustrating our constructions. Cyclic homology was introduced by Connes in his seminal work on noncommutative geometry  Con  . It can be defined as the Hochschild homology of certain algebras called cyclic objects.

This talk will discuss some of the science that can be done using ALMA observations of the Solar Chromosphere. The Solar Chromosphere is one of the most enigmatic regions of the Sun.

However, due to its extremely low density, direct observation of the chromosphere was not possible until recently when high-resolution images were obtained by space-based telescopes such as Hinode/SOT and SDO/AIA. In addition, ground-based observatories have also made significant progress towards studying the chromosphere through various techniques including spectropolarimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and speckle interferometry. Despite these advances, there are still many open questions about the physical processes occurring within the chromosphere which need to be addressed.

For example, it has been suggested that quasars trigger starburst activities in nearby galaxies via intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation and/or gravitational interactions (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006) . \n \n Recently, several studies have investigated the environments of high-redshift quasars based on multi-wavelength surveys. These include optical/near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g., Adelberger & Steidel 2005; Venemans et al. 2007) , radio continuum emission (e.g., Carilli et al. 2007; Overzier et al. 2008 ) and X-ray emission (e.g,. Brandt et al. 2002; Gilli et al. 2003 ) . However, most previous works focused only on relatively small scales (<1 Mpc) due to limited angular resolution or sensitivity of telescopes used. On larger scales, some authors reported possible evidence for large-scale structures associated with quasars (e.g., Kurk et al. 2000; Pentericci et al",

We find that the IR emission is consistent with being produced by dust heated to temperatures between 100 K and 1000 K; this temperature range corresponds to an observed flux density at 8 microns ranging from 0.1 mJy to 1 Jy. The spectral index of the IR emission does not change significantly during these variations. This result suggests that the physical conditions within the emitting region are relatively constant over time scales as short as one month. These results also suggest that the IR emission may be dominated by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron radiation. \n \n Keywords: black hole physics, infrared astronomy, radio source variability, space telescopes, X-ray astronomy \n \n \n \n Black holes have been predicted to produce intense electromagnetic fields near their event horizons. However, direct observational evidence has remained elusive because of the extreme environment surrounding such objects. One possible way to detect such fields would be through the detection of polarized light emitted close to the horizon. Another possibility involves detecting changes in the spectrum or intensity of the accretion flow onto the black hole itself. Such changes could occur if the magnetic field lines threading the disk were twisted into helical shapes due to differential rotation. If so, they can act like antennae which amplify any incoming waves along them. As a consequence, the local plasma frequency will increase, causing the plasma to become more opaque to lower-frequency waves but less opaque to higher frequencies.

In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z.

We show that in this case it is possible to obtain accurate results using only two parameters instead of three as was previously thought necessary (the third parameter being the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the shell s thickness). The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration. This makes our approach much faster than previous methods while retaining high accuracy. Our method can be used to model the response of the Earth s crust to tectonic stresses and other processes such as volcanic loading and sedimentary deposition. It also has applications in geophysics beyond Earth sciences including planetary science, astrophysics and seismology. \nTheory\n\nIn order to study the deformation of the Earth s crust we need to know how the stress field changes across different regions of the planet. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the stress field evolves during plate boundary interactions like subduction zones and transform faults. To do so, we use the theory of elasticity to find solutions to problems involving the interaction between plates and their underlying mantle. However, solving these problems analytically requires simplifying assumptions about the geometry of the system and the mechanical properties of the materials involved. \n\nOne important simplification made when studying the mechanics of plate boundaries is to assume that they behave as if they were composed of thin elastic shells. These shells have been shown to provide good approximations to more realistic models of plate boundaries because they allow for rapid calculations of the stress fields within them. For example, Figure 1 shows a comparison between the predictions obtained using a simple spherical shell model and those produced by a finite element model of the San Andreas Fault System.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison between the predicted displacements along the San Andreas fault calculated using a spherical shell model (blue line) and a finite element model (red dots).",

In order to measure the spatial resolution of a detector we need to have some reference point against which we compare our measured data  2  .\nOne way to obtain this reference point is to use a light source emitting photons at a well-defined angle relative to the normal direction  3  , see Fig.  1(a) . If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all detected photons will come from a small area around the center of the detector surface. By scanning the detector over different angles θ, we can find out what fraction of the total number of counts comes from each part of the detector  4  . We call these fractions the response function R(θ) of the detector  5  . Knowing the shape of the response function allows us to calculate the spatial resolution of the detector  6  . However, if there is more than one pixel per unit solid angle, the situation becomes complicated because now several pixels could detect a given photon  7, 8  . To solve this problem we introduce here a new concept -the joint probability P ij that i-th and j-th pixels detect a photon simultaneously  9  .
