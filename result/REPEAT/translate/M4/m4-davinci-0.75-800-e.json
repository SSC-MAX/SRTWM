They are also a typical model for studying self-organized criticality. In network research, several platforms have proposed extending the differentiated formulas of contact processes by introducing components such as spatial heterogeneity, aging, memory, and heterogeneity.

However, despite these efforts, precise solutions for contact processes remain elusive.

Among these techniques, the so-called supercritical series expansion provides a method to study the effects of systems approaching the epidemic threshold.

This work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant 14-50-00040. 1 Introduction.\nThe problem of statistical description of the energy levels of complex quantum systems has been studied extensively during last decades (see e.g.,  1  ). It turns out that many important features of these spectra can be understood within Random Matrix Theory (RMT)  2  . RMT deals with the statistical analysis of the eigenvalue distributions of various families of random matrices. One of the most popular models considered in RMT is the so-called Wigner ensemble  3  , where one considers N ×N Hermitian matrices H = H † with independent identically distributed elements h ij having mean zero and variance 1/N . For example, if the probability density function p(h) of each element h ij decays fast enough at |h| → ∞ then it follows from the standard arguments  4  that the empirical measure µ N of the normalized eigenvectors of H converges weakly almost surely to some deterministic probability measure µ on the unit circle T = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} called circular law.

Results indicate that the underwater characteristics of these spectra can be explained within the framework of random matrix theory (RMT). RMT involves the statistical properties of eigenvalues from families of random matrices. One of the most famous models considered in RMT is the so-called Wigner model, which involves N×N Hermitian matrices H = H†, with independent and identically distributed elements \\( H_{ij} \\) having a mean of zero and a variance of \\( 1/N \\). For instance, if the probability density function of each element \\( H_{ij} \\) decays as \\( | \\text{difference} | \\to \\infty \\), then according to standard arguments, the empirical distribution \\( \\mu_N \\) of the normalized eigenvectors weakly converges to a certain deterministic distribution \\( \\mu \\), which is known as the semicircle on the unit circle \\( T = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| = 1 \\} \\). Additionally, under conditions regarding the decay rate, the Stieltjes transform \\( m_N(z) := E \\text{Tr}(H - z^{-1}) \\) converges pointwise to the Stieltjes transform \\( M(z) \\) of \\( \\mu \\). In many studies, the behavior of the spectrum near its edges has been thoroughly investigated, revealing the fluctuation statistical properties of the maximum eigenvalue \\( \\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\).",

These applications include reflectivity, negative refraction, nonlinear responses, and more, making them promising candidates in fields such as optoelectronic devices and photovoltaic technology. Recent studies have shown that periodic multilayer structures composed of anisotropic layers exhibit remarkably significant phenomena in electromagnetic radiation, including slow wave resonance (SWR). This phenomenon occurs when the designed Bloch wave number platform becomes zero under certain conditions. This leads to a maximum effective refractive index, where the slow wave refers to the propagation speed within the medium, while v_ph is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave. Consequently, the simultaneous transmission spectrum exhibits sharp decline characteristics, accompanied by a narrow bandwidth. These features are highly desirable for structures with specific applications.

We show that this system can be mapped onto a spinless fermion model by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ground state energy is calculated exactly within the framework of Bethe ansatz method. It turns out that there exists a critical value of the magnetic field strength beyond which the ground state becomes degenerate. This result agrees well with previous numerical calculations based on exact diagonalization technique. \n \n In addition we calculate the density-density correlation function as well as the momentum distribution function numerically. These results agree very well with those obtained analytically through the use of Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be generalized to higher dimensions. Introduction:-In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the problem of strongly correlated electrons in low dimensional systems such as quantum wires or carbon nanotubes  1-3 . One of the most interesting phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantized Hall effect (FQHE)  4  .

One of the most intriguing phenomena observed experimentally is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Studies have shown that as the number of electrons N increases, the lowest Landau level (LLL) can accommodate only one electron per quantum. FQHE has attracted significant interest as it provides an opportunity to explore fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics. Recently, the authors investigated the modified Coulomb interaction between two platforms with opposite charges under a magnetic field B perpendicular to their plane. They found that the difference in ground state energy depends on whether the total angular momentum J = L + S is zero, where L is the orbital angular momentum and S is the spin angular momentum. For instance, if J = 0, the ground state energy is given by E0 = −e² / lB + O(1/N), where lB = eB / mc is the magnetic length. On the other hand, if J = 1/2, the expression for the ground state energy is modified to E0.",

The study of fractional calculus has rapidly developed online due to its widespread applications across various scientific fields (References 1-4). Initially, it was applied to model the fine demands of anomalous Miles (Reference 5). For instance, this approach has been successfully used to model sub-diffusion (Reference 6), super-diffusion (Reference 7), and Lévy flights (Reference 8). In summary, fractional differential equations do not have a universal analytical solution (Reference 9). Therefore, there has been considerable interest in developing numerical methods to approximate these equations (Reference 10). However, when we modify different computational methods, they do not always yield sufficiently accurate results (Reference 11). This issue is particularly pronounced when dealing with strongly nonlinear problems (Reference 12) or considering very large time intervals (Reference 13). To overcome the difficulties associated with the existence of solutions, the authors have proposed various techniques based on special methods (References 14-16).

The majority of these flares are soft, but there is evidence for both hard and very-hard flares as well. In addition to studying individual flares, we examine the spectral properties of all flares combined using time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. Our results indicate that the average spectrum can be described by an absorbed power law model with photon index Γ = 1.6 ± 0.1 and hydrogen column density NH = 2 × 10^22 cm^{-2}. \n \n Using this best-fit model, we calculate the total energy emitted in each flare over its duration.

In fact, this raises the question of whether dark matter is merely a single type of particle—as most theoretical models assume—or whether it is composed of different components. One possibility is that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), such as the neutralinos predicted in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model. To observationally validate these scenarios, astronomers are searching for signatures of dark matter in astrophysical phenomena, such as modified galaxies, compact galaxies, and quasars. A promising approach is to look for gravitational lensing systems where distant objects are modified by the interference of dark matter halos. If dark matter consists of WIMPs, their mass should fall between 10 GeV and 100 TeV. For example, recent studies suggest that the gravitational lensing phenomenon of the Abell 2218 cluster may be entirely composed of WIMPs.",

Due to its parallel computing requirements, LBM has been widely applied in high-performance computing. Recently, LBM has achieved significant success in various flow problems. The fundamental requirement of LBM is to modify the distribution function f(x, t) at each node x on a regular grid using a finite number of discrete velocities ci (i = ciΔt / Δx), where Δx and Δt represent spatial and temporal resolutions, respectively. The behavior of these particles is governed by the following equation: τ represents the relaxation time that controls the rate at which the distribution approaches equilibrium.

Keywords: power allocation; convex optimization; time-varying; multiple access channels (MACs); wireless communication; iterative algorithm.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn wireless priority systems, recent research has shown that the performance of HM users' transmissions depends on how patriotic resources are allocated among different users. For instance, when multiple users share a common wireless resource (such as a channel or different channels), the optimal priority for allocating these resources will depend on various system settings, such as whether users have equal priorities and the types of services they request. Therefore, priority resource allocation strategies should consider all relevant factors to maximize overall performance. Significant research effort has been devoted to studying resource allocation issues in network communications. Among these issues, channel allocation plays a crucial role due to its significant impact on priority efficiency and cooperative ranking. However, most previous studies have assumed that the input alphabet is continuous, while digital modulation schemes use discrete constellations. Consequently, existing methods cannot be directly applied to discrete input scenarios. To address this issue, recent studies have explored the allocation problem for discrete input signals. However, their solutions either require significant computational complexity at the receiver or face limitations in speed.",

Introduction\nSpace-time block coding (STBC), proposed by Alamouti, is widely used in wireless communication due to its simplicity and high data transmission rates. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts dedicated to designing various classes of STBC. The primary goal of these designs is to achieve higher efficiency while maintaining good error performance under different transmission conditions, such as multipath propagation or frequency-selective fading. However, most existing STBC designs focus solely on improving error performance without considering the complexity of implementation. This has prompted us to develop a class of STBC that can be implemented with lower complexity. Recently, some authors have shown that certain component fields of interest, such as Galois fields GF(ṭ), finite rings, quaternions, etc., can also be represented through the requirements of a recovery-exchange ring known as Clifford algebra. These representations enable us to determine Salon breathing constellations, modulation techniques, and advanced systems. Inspired by these facts, we propose a novel STBC construction based on Clifford algebra. Research indicates that the proposed STBC can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) when compared to existing STBCs.",

Introduction\nIn this revised paper, we explore the application of super quantum mechanics (SQM) in a dimer model with modified fermionic boundary conditions. These models were initially introduced by Rokhsar et al. as a solvable model describing a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice. They demonstrated that these models exhibit spontaneous dimerization phenomena at low temperatures. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of parity breaking in supersymmetric systems. The results indicate that supersymmetry is largely dependent on the boundary conditions of the system. As will be clarified later, significant changes in supersymmetry occur when switching between periodic and free fermionic boundary conditions.",

By performing a variational analysis on the metric tensor, we can derive hints for the field equations. This process helps to understand why general relativity does not exhibit ultraviolet divergences in the case of a single loop (i.e., when there is only one graviton loop). It also reveals the physical significance of the cosmological constant in Einstein's field equations. Furthermore, it allows us to dismiss corrections to the effective theory caused by higher-order terms that arise in the expansion of flat spacetime. Finally, we discuss potential issues in applying these techniques to more complex systems, such as superstrings or supergravity. The renormalization method is applied to study effective modifications in quantum gravity systems. We derive the gravitational field equations through a variational approach to the metric tensor.

This prediction aligns closely with platform observations. Furthermore, we believe that the current value of the Hubble constant, H0 = 72 ± 8 km/s/Mpc, is consistent with major measurements. Finally, we discuss some tests of this model using the Jon experiment, such as the SNAP satellite project.\n\nIntroduction: Recently, modified explanations for the expansion of Minneapolis have been proposed. Research has found that if the universe is dominated solely by normal matter, its expansion rate would be lower than expected, indicating the necessity of another component known as dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, the nature of dark energy remains unknown. Many models have been proposed to explain its origin. In this article, we will consider a dark energy model with additional dimensions. According to these components, our four-dimensional universe operates on a three-dimensional surface (3-brane) embedded in five-dimensional space. If dark energy propagates into higher-dimensional space, it may affect the matter residing on the 3-brane. For instance, if a distant dark energy field exists outside the 3-brane but within higher-dimensional space, its gravitational effects will influence us, even though the field itself does not directly interact with us. Thus, the existence of additional dimensions allows the influence of dark energy to extend beyond the predictions of general relativity.",

They have been extensively studied both theoretically and observationally. An important aspect of black hole physics is how objects move in their vicinity, particularly those that can escape the black hole. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that there are interesting physical phenomena present in scenarios close to the event horizon. For instance, if we consider a charged object falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, its worldline will change due to the so-called photon sphere. If the object's charge is sufficiently large, it will fall into the black hole after emitting photons. Another example occurs when a neutral object falls into a Kerr black hole. In this case, the object's trajectory will also change due to the alteration of photon orbits. However, unlike the situation with the Reissner-Nordström black hole, the current field contains not only photons but also gravitons. In recent years, many studies have focused on the dynamics of fields outside the intended field. In this context, the problem of finding the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) has also garnered attention.",

These platforms are explained by the following equation: x² + y² - z² - t² = (payment²)(1 - (v / walking))¹/², where \"difference\" denotes speed and \"v\" represents the compensation of the prioritized object. This necessitates measuring the distances along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and t-axis separately. For example, if you observe someone in the living room facing you, they will have a payment value on the x-axis, but no value in the other three directions, as there are no platforms in those directions. If you see them walking towards you in Lyon, their values in all three directions will be negative, except for the x-axis, because they are experimentally different in that direction. Another example is considering two objects moving side by side along a road. They will move simultaneously at the same speed, thus their velocities will be equal. However, if one object moves north and the other moves south, they will move more slowly relative to each other, even though their speeds are the same.",

This scenario suggests a localization-delocalization transition when the compensation temperature T crosses Tc = 1.

The results are consistent with studies conducted on undisturbed CIMs using Monte Carlo simulations on large lattices.

This occurs when different thermodynamic states coexist in equilibrium or when metastable states are present. A typical example is the treatment of water, where ice and liquid water coexist below 0°C. Earlier research has focused on understanding how interfaces separating different phases evolve under the influence of external factors such as thermal fluctuations, magnetic fields, and mechanical stress. These studies have been extensively explored through experiments on various materials, including ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, superconductors, colloids, granular media, glasses, foams, and biological systems. For instance, it has been found that the dynamics of domains in magnets largely depend on whether they are in an ordered state. Similarly, the critical behavior of glasses and confined materials is closely related to their shear response. On the other hand, while the effects of quenching on interfaces have been the subject of considerable theoretical and numerical investigation in past studies, they remain insufficiently explained. Recently, the emergence of Lyon components in spatial systems has drawn significant attention to interface issues.",

        "translate_text": "We have studied various polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which arise from different perturbations generated through inflationary conditions or other mechanisms. We demonstrate that these modified perturbations can be detected through their imprints on the Stokes parameters Q and U. In certain cases, we found that the correlation between the two Stokes parameters is related to the amplitude of the perturbations on large scales. This provides different perspectives for various inflationary models as well as other scenarios, such as topological defects. The discovery of B-mode polarization in the CMB offers new opportunities to go beyond standard cosmology, including the generation of primordial tensor modes during inflation. However, it remains an open question whether this is primarily due to scalar fluctuations or primordial tensor modes. Tensor modes can also introduce non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation ζ. These non-Gaussianities have been studied through various methods. Research indicates that the bispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation contains information about the spectrum Pζ(k) and the spectral index ns. Recent studies show that the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation contains additional information regarding the scalar-to-tensor ratio, where PT represents the tensor spectrum and PS represents the scalar spectrum.",

In addition to these two YSOs, we also identified other point-like NIR sources within the main area of CB 54. These sources may be massive pre-main-sequence stars or background stars. Our results indicate that this cloud has undergone different stages of star formation during its evolution.

Newton's law of gravitation fails to explain the phenomenon of objects falling towards a unique center (i.e., the Sun). Einstein's theory of relativity addresses this phenomenon by introducing the concept of curved spacetime. However, there are still other physical phenomena, such as the Casimir effect and electromagnetic pressure effects, that require new theories to be introduced in spacetime. In this paper, we propose the introduction of a new spacetime structure to extend classical Euclidean geometry. We demonstrate that gravity can be understood as a macroscopic manifestation of microscopic effects related to quantum fluctuations in spacetime.

These systems provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum phenomena such as superfluidity, supersolidity, and topological insulators, utilizing atomic experimental platforms. In these experiments, energy is applied to a captured atom, which experiences a periodic potential in the direction perpendicular to the surface. This leads to the formation of surface-induced optical lattices (SIL). Atoms in the lattice, under weak coupling with the substrate, experience real effects from their interaction with the surface. Consequently, their behavior resembles that of particles in three-dimensional space. Although some progress has been made in understanding the behavior of atoms captured in SIL, studies on their dynamics remain relatively scarce. Here, we consider the case of an atom excited to state |t⟩ on a certain varying platform E0. If the excitation energy exceeds the depth of the SIL, V0, the atom will escape into the continuous state.

For instance, magnetism in solids is generated due to strong interactions between their magnetic moments. Similarly, liquid helium experiences superfluidity below its critical temperature T_interest = 2.17 K, which is due to the tightly bound bosons of helium-4 behaving like Cooper pairs. These phenomena suggest that understanding collective behavior requires studying large ensembles rather than merely focusing on individual families. However, simulating the macroscopic behavior of complex systems composed of multiple microscopic components is one of the most challenging problems in contemporary computational physics. In fact, while microscopic interactions can be described by quantum mechanics, the macroscopic behavior of large-scale ensembles often necessitates the use of approximate methods that fail to capture the subtle correlations between different parts of the system. Consequently, numerical simulations of large, finely detailed world systems using methods like Monte Carlo become exceedingly complex.",

In this article, we propose a service model that addresses three key components of platform archives: archives are viewed as interconnected elements (e.g., documents, photos); each platform is interconnected with one or more other platforms, involving functions such as publishing, storage, and sharing; these components are organized into a system that reflects their relationships. We explore how individuals can utilize these components to manage their personal archives and discuss its application in various contexts where large amounts of data need to be managed. The rapid growth of digital media has sparked interest in developing systems that enable users to save and share their experimental information across different devices and platforms. However, existing approaches often focus on providing solutions for storing and accessing content rather than addressing broader needs. This issue becomes even more complex when dealing with collections of archives that span multiple platforms. To tackle this problem, we propose a service platform architecture for storing and maintaining archive components.",

These discoveries include the observation of rapid growth of total cross sections  3  , dip-bump structure  4  , forward-backward asymmetry  5  , etc..

This phenomenon occurs because these materials undergo a phase transition, forming a state composed of bosonic quasiparticles (such as Cooper pairs). However, until recently, the microscopic theory of this pairing mechanism has gradually become clearer, particularly in the context of d-wave pairing. Research indicates that a key factor leading to this behavior is the strong electronic state differences present on the Fermi surface, which are closely related to the behavior of collective excitations such as phonons. Therefore, understanding the role of phonons in different lattice structures is crucial for comprehending the interactions between charge carriers.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the role of phonons in various types of superconducting materials.

We demonstrate that cosmic strings can produce additional effects during the expansion phase when magnetic fields are trapped in overly dense regions. Small loops from different platform salons gradually evolve into larger excesses through gravitational corrections. This process is similar to that proposed for electroweak strings formed after expansion. However, our research indicates that the distribution of loops differs from previous studies. Firstly, it includes a greater number of large loops that are comparable to the Hubble scale today. These loops may be detected as random gravitational wave or gamma-ray signals. The existence of cosmic strings has been predicted since the 1980s. They may arise naturally if there are extra dimensions beyond the standard model, or they could be produced under extreme conditions. Cosmic strings can generate observable phenomena such as gravitational lensing effects, anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and primordial gravitational waves. Despite the interest in this area, direct evidence for cosmic strings has yet to be found. One reason for their elusiveness is that they are expected to have very small mass (less than $10^{-16} eV$). Another issue is that cosmic strings are not stable; they disappear through rapid decay. Therefore, any observational results must be indirectly derived from the products of cosmic string decay. To predict observational outcomes, detailed studies of cosmological simulations are required.

Introduction\nPolymer-modified materials have been widely used as coatings for solid modification or as additives in industrial applications, including respiration, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food. A common method for producing these modified platforms is through the polymerization of monomers within small droplets suspended in water, known as emulsions. This process can be achieved through chemical or physical methods, depending on whether the droplets contain the substances necessary to initiate the polymerization reaction. For instance, if the droplets do not contain any required components, they must be treated separately before being added to the main ingredients. Once the treatment is complete, the droplets will begin to polymerize until their degree of modification is comparable to the wavelengths passing through them. At this point, the droplets become optically opaque, and growth continues, ultimately forming large HM micro-micelles. These HM can then be separated from the solution using centrifugation or filtration techniques. Alternatively, different types of emulsifiers can be used to ensure the stability of the droplets throughout the process.

It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, with each carbon atom forming covalent bonds with three neighboring carbon atoms. Due to its two-dimensional nature, graphene exhibits outstanding electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, high transparency, and flexibility. These remarkable properties make graphene a promising candidate for nanoscale electronic devices. Graphene nanoribbons (G-NRs), which are graphene strips of specific widths, have been proposed as a foundation for manufacturing high-performance devices, including transistors, interconnects, photodetectors, and solar cells. Compared to silicon-based materials, GNRs offer several advantages: they have higher electron mobility; they perform better in terms of charge carriers; they provide more quantum degrees of freedom; and they can achieve higher current densities. However, the practical application of GNRs still faces some challenges. For instance, the manufacturing process requires precise control over ribbon width and edge roughness. Additionally, the electrical performance of GNRs is highly sensitive to environmental conditions.",

We employed the same likelihood as in Jarosik et al. (2006), but now also included information about the noise covariance matrix and its uncertainties, which were not considered in the earlier study. The main objective is to investigate whether large-scale polarization correlations can be explained within the standard cosmological model featuring adiabatic expansion and Gaussian primordial fluctuations, or if other theories beyond this simple framework are necessary. We also focus on different predictions recently proposed by some authors, which suggest that such correlations may be due to large-scale experimental lensing effects.

These so-called ghost particles, if they exist, may manifest through experimental signatures. It has been shown on certain platforms that the decay of the SM into ghost particles can lead to deviations from the expected exponential behavior. Such deviations should be observable in experiments. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that ghost particles may play a role in some puzzling features observed in recent cosmic data. Another possibility is that ghost particles couple directly with SM fermions. If this is the case, one could expect decay behaviors similar to those predicted for Kaluza-Klein gravitons coupled to leptons, as referenced in the literature. In other words, the cross-section for dense SM fermions and ghost particles would grow logarithmically with differences. This logarithmic growth has already been found in theories involving processes such as Tacoma + e - → e + e - U, U → eν, and U → μτ. However, in all these processes, only the case of scalar ghost particles has been considered. The results indicate that similar couplings would contribute significantly to the amplitudes, thereby substantially modifying previous predictions.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, space weather has garnered increasing attention due to its significant impact on satellite platforms, communication systems, power grids, and other aspects of daily life (e.g., 1). In this context, solar activity plays a crucial role in the Earth's environment as it carries magnetic flux generated by the solar dynamo and influences the Earth's magnetosphere. The solar wind is released from the Sun as coronal mass ejections. Coronal mass ejections occur when excessive material escapes from the Sun into space during intense activity on the solar surface. Their duration typically lasts for several hours. Consequently, solar wind speed can vary significantly within a 24-hour period. However, most previous studies have primarily focused on average solar wind speed or specific solar activity speeds. Therefore, research on the variations of solar wind speed over shorter time scales is relatively limited.",

Keywords: Wireless Local Area Network, packet arrival time, fairness, throughput improvement.\n\nWith the rapid development of mobile devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants, and smartphones, there is a growing interest in providing high-quality WLAN services. However, due to the disparities in resources within WLANs, resource management has become crucial. The most commonly used access control method in current commercial WLAN products is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which shares the wireless channel through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and provides timed services through Point Coordination Function (PCF). Although CSMA/CA allows different stations to share the same wireless channel without centralized coordination, its system performance is affected as the number of active stations increases. This issue primarily arises from interference between different terminals, leading to potential packet collisions when two stations attempt to send data simultaneously. Several methods have been proposed to address these problems. Among these methods, the authors of a certain literature introduced a simple yet effective approach called the Modified Reservation Channel (VRC) to reduce collisions of data frames between different stations. They also proposed a modified VRC method to further enhance the performance of CSMA/CA under heavy load. However, all these studies assume that the number of active stations is fixed.",

We find that the junction conductance depends strongly on the tilt angle between the molecule backbone and the substrate normal.

Our findings indicate that both tests effectively guide the identification of substructure in most aging galaxy clusters, while also highlighting some differences between them. Specifically, we found that the Dressler & Shectman method tends to overestimate the number of substructures compared to the Voronoi tessellation technique. Furthermore, the identification efficiency can be improved by up to 30% by combining infrared information with X-ray data.

To fully exploit parallelism, systems need to be designed to operate efficiently across multiple processors. However, these systems often require some form of data redistribution during execution. For instance, consider a computation where each processing unit stores a subset of a dataset (e.g., a matrix). If the number of datasets changes at runtime, all processing units need to exchange information about which parts of their stored datasets need to be updated before they can continue execution. This issue becomes even more complex if the structure of the stored datasets varies among different processing units or if there are dependencies between them.",

We find that this leads to an additional term in the action which is proportional to the volume form of S5, but does not affect any other fields or equations of motion. The resulting solution has a non-vanishing dilaton at infinity, corresponding to a deformation of the conformal symmetry group by a scale transformation. This can be interpreted as giving rise to a mass gap for all states except those transforming trivially under the unbroken SO(4) subgroup of SU (4). In particular we show how this mechanism allows one to generate masses for all gauge bosons without breaking supersymmetry. We also discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction: It was shown recently  1  , using the gauged linear sigma model approach  2  , that it is possible to deform the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (MSYM) theory in 4-dimensions such that only the vector multiplets acquire masses while preserving N = 1 supersymmetry.

The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process.

Chemical systems primarily form complex spatial structures, such as stripes or rings, which spontaneously emerge without any external compensation.

The most famous example is the so-called Liesegang phenomenon, where metallic precipitates form when two solutions react with each other. In this process, the solution simultaneously contains cations (e.g., Ag+) and anions (e.g., Cl-). When these two solutions come into contact, they begin to diffuse into each other until they reach a platform where the opposing components neutralize each other. At certain moments after mixing, different components attempt to form solid families that separate the solution. With further growth, they ultimately create concentric rings around a center.

A key issue regarding these proposals is how to protect qubits from the effects of noise. It has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that interactions between qubits with different tunings can lead to phenomena such as decoherence or decay. This problem becomes even more severe when considering large-scale interacting qubit networks. Here, we consider a simple model consisting of two weakly coupled SQUIDs immersed in a phonon environment. Our goal is to study the impact of the interaction term on the reduced density matrix of each SQUID. To this end, we use the Bethe ansatz method to analytically solve the Schrödinger equation associated with our model. As expected, we find that the presence of interactions accelerates decoherence and dissipation. Furthermore, we discover that the decay of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix is linearly related to the temperature T, while their von Neumann entropy exhibits a logarithmic relationship with time t.\n\nModel: The total Hamiltonian \\( H = H_0 + V \\) describes a system formed by \\( N = 2 \\) SQUIDs coupled through a weak tunneling amplitude \\( J \\), immersed in a zero-temperature phonon reservoir.",

This effect challenges parity conservation and offers potential clues to new physical phenomena. However, there has only been one previous measurement of asymmetry in hadron double jet production at high energy. That measurement was conducted at RHIC, with a center-of-mass energy of √sNN = 200 GeV for proton-proton collisions, which is significantly lower than the energy of the current experiment.",

In this study, we consider a delay differential equation (DDE) for a pulse-coupled system. In these models, each node can be described by its own internal dynamics, which evolve continuously over time but only transmit between nodes at discrete moments. The transmission delay may affect certain dynamic characteristics based on the distance between two neurons. This interaction leads to the emergence of delay phenomena in DDEs, influencing the behavior of Loewner systems. Time delay feedback plays a crucial role in biological systems, including active components. For instance, experiments have shown that the presence of delays can lead to unstable activity in neuronal cultures. Additionally, delays also impact the collective behavior of coupled oscillators. Another notable feature of DDE models is their ability to handle non-local interactions. Nonlinear coupling also plays an important role in modeling complex systems. Indeed, preliminary experimental results indicate that synaptic connections between neurons are not simply linear relationships. Furthermore, they exhibit saturation effects.

Research indicates that the photon statistics of such systems are governed by the first-order coherence function g(1)(τ)², which exhibits bunching behavior over short timescales and anti-bunching behavior over longer timescales. It has been pointed out that this characteristic arises from destructive interference between different paths associated with the emission of photons. Recently, the authors investigated the impact of spontaneous emission on second-order temporal correlations. They demonstrated that the presence of spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics. However, these studies were limited to the case of atoms interacting with a single field. On the other hand, there are also experimental studies involving atoms interacting with multiple electromagnetic field modes. For instance, in reference 10, the authors examined the effect of course fluctuations on the fluorescence spectrum of a three-level system and conducted experiments using two laser beams. Furthermore, they found that the intensity of the reduced noise strongly depends on the different coupling platforms between the lasers. Inspired by these experimental results, we consider the issue of second-order temporal correlations for an atom interacting with two principal modes.",

A key feature of most afterglows is the steep change observed in the light curve following an initial burst (Rhoads 1999). This phenomenon is typically explained as a result of synchrotron radiation self-absorption when the relativistic ejecta become optically thick, leading to a rapid decline in luminosity. However, some authors argue that this phenomenon may also be due to continued external energy input to the ejecta after the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al., 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000), while others suggest it may stem from changes in the properties of the emission region (e.g., Racusin et al., 2008). Another explanation involves the phenomenon of interstellar scintillation (Goodman 1997; Goodman & Narayan 2006).",

This systematic error may explain why different observational results are inconsistent within their error margins. Furthermore, it may also impact the true measurement of the cosmological constant. \n\nIntroduction - The components of our universe's expansion differ from theories presented in some literature, naturally leading to discussions about its nature. One possibility is that the differences in the cosmological constant are merely the effects of vacuum energy. Another possibility is that these differences arise from particles such as axions. To observationally validate these ideas, precise measurements of the universe's composition are required. However, this task faces numerous challenges. For instance, although the trend of accelerated expansion is very slight, with the Hubble constant H₀ approximately 100h km/s/Mpc and the value of the cosmological constant around 0.7±0.1, the changes in the distance-redshift relationship due to the age of the universe are significant, making direct measurement difficult. Additionally, the variation of the cosmological constant affects the passage of time, which further increases the uncertainty in distance measurements. Finally, the evolution of the cosmological constant over time complicates the issue. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to directly measure the evolution of the cosmological constant (z), where ρde and ρm represent the densities of dark energy and matter, respectively. If the cosmological constant behaves like perfect vacuum energy, then J(z) ≡ -1. Research indicates that the most...",

The research was conducted within an effective field theory framework, using chiral perturbation theory to describe the interactions between mesons and nucleons up to first-order corrections. We then considered the meson degrees of freedom through an implicit gauge formalism. In our study, we took into account contributions from one-loop diagrams, which involve interactions mediated by the ρ meson at the correction level. Our theoretical model allows us to distinguish between neutral reactions, such as electron-proton reactions, and charged reactions, such as meson production on protons.

        "translate_text": "We studied the generation of magnetic fields and subsequent resonance effects in the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) through numerical simulations and experimental spatial differences. We found that, under most threshold parameters, the magnetic field is amplified to an energy equilibrium state within a few hundred milliseconds. The amplification process can be explained by momentum components through Monte Carlo dynamics. After reaching its maximum value, the magnetic field gradually decays due to adiabatic expansion and Ohmic dissipation. Our results indicate that simultaneous X-ray flares are excess phenomena generated by internal shocks between different regions located within the progenitor star.\n\nKeywords: gamma-ray bursts, magnetic fields, dynamical effects, relativistic blast waves, turbulence\n\n1. Introduction Increasingly, literature on online platforms suggests that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be related to experimental aether (e.g., Woosley & Bloom 2006). If this holds true, it implies that these explosions could occur in environments surrounded by stellar winds or circumstellar material. Such environments can significantly alter the dynamics and characteristics of the explosion and its afterglow components. For instance, Chevalier et al. (2004) pointed out that if the medium lacks an r^-2 power law, the resulting light curve would exhibit a plateau followed by a weak rebrightening phase. This behavior has since been confirmed observationally (e.g., Panaitescu 2005; Kumar & Panaitescu 2008), supporting the scenario that GRBs originate from such progenitors (e.g., Zhang 2007). However, other authors have raised objections to this scenario both theoretically (e.g., Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2005) and observationally (e.g., Lazzati et al. 2009). Notably, while the density of gamma-ray bursts seems to support this trend, there are also cases where interactions with similar environments are not evident.",

Keywords: non-equilibrium entropy, Lattice Boltzmann method, entropy limiter, second law of thermodynamics, shock waves.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn the field of computational fluid dynamics, there is a growing interest in developing dynamics-based components. Compared to traditional Navier-Stokes solvers, these methods are more accurate in capturing complex flow phenomena such as shock waves, turbulence, and interface phenomena. The Lattice Boltzmann method has garnered widespread attention due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it is important to note that most existing LB models do not satisfy the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. This issue becomes more pronounced when dealing with high Mach number situations. To address this challenge, several recent studies have made attempts. For instance, Chen et al. introduced a modified BGK-type term that restores the correct equilibrium state while satisfying the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. Similarly, Yu et al. proposed another entropy-consistent LB scheme utilizing the concept of entropy moments. Recently, Shan et al. introduced a novel LB model where the requirements are determined based on the Knudsen number. Although these studies have yielded positive results, they all require information about macroscopic quantities such as pressure and velocity fields. Therefore, their applicability is often limited to simple single-component gases. Here, we propose a new method for an entropy-consistent LB model. Our strategy relies on adding...",

Here, we report a cell sorting technique based on continuous magnetic migration using microfluidic technology. We separate target cells from red blood cells (RBCs) suspended in a local solution by applying a magnetic field gradient within a microchannel. The results indicate that our method can serve as a simple and effective means for separating different types of cells, achieving high purity and efficiency. This improvement may be significant for the development of diagnostic tools based on microscale blood testing. Magnetic valve technology plays an important role in various fields, including biomedicine, technology, life sciences, and the food industry. However, most existing components require large equipment, making them unsuitable for use outside of laboratory environments. Recently, there has been increasing interest among researchers in miniaturizing these systems into integrated laboratory platforms that can incorporate functions such as sample preparation, cell separation, drug screening, and bioassays. Due to their simplicity, low cost, portability, and compatibility with other microfabricated components, magnetic separators have garnered widespread attention. For instance, research teams have achieved magnetic separation of biological samples within microchannels or on planar surfaces. Despite some progress, existing separation methods still have limitations. First, they primarily rely on batch operations, which restrict throughput and require large input samples. Second, existing studies have only targeted two different types of cells, and the separation efficiency is not ideal for more complex mixtures. Third, the process of fabricating multi-channel platforms is complex, making it difficult to integrate additional functionalities. Finally, most studies have been conducted under static conditions, which limits the optimal performance of the designs.",

We use vector magnetograms obtained by SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI instruments as well as photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms provided by GONG network. The evolution of the coronal magnetic field is studied using potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model. In addition we perform NLFFF extrapolations with different codes for comparison purposes. Our results show that both PFSS and NLFFF models are able to reproduce the large-scale structure of the corona but differ significantly at small scales. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the effect of plasma flows along open field lines. Finally, we study the relationship between the observed photospheric motions and the changes in the coronal magnetic field. Active Region NOAA 11158 was one of the most energetic regions ever recorded. It produced several X-class flares including an X2.2 event on February 16, 2011 , when it crossed the central meridian.

There are various theoretical models to explain dark matter, but none have been experimentally confirmed to date. One possibility is that dark matter consists of an excess of some fundamental particles.

On the other hand, if their interactions with ordinary matter are strong, they can be directly detected. Many experiments are searching for traces of dark matter.

However, there is currently no clear explanation for theories beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as massless neutrinos, lepton number conservation, extra dimensions, and supersymmetry. Many extensions of the SM predict additional contributions in the effective four-fermion interaction Lagrangian, which could lead to observable deviations from SM predictions. For example, recent studies suggest that the refractive index of certain quantum models depends on energy in the form n = 1 + εE / E0, where E0 is some characteristic energy. This would lead to modifications in the oscillation formula, namely sin²θ12 = 1−cos²θ12 + ε/2 + O(ε³), which has significant implications for neutrino propagation.\n\nIn addition to these theoretical motivations, there are experimental indications pointing to phenomena beyond the SM: i) missing solar neutrinos at the Large Hadron Collider; ii) anomalies in LSND and MiniBooNE suggesting short baseline νμ → νe transitions, which are not predicted in the three-flavor neutrino oscillation model; iii) anomalies in the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.",

It involves recovering harmonic structures from an excess of musical demands or MIDI files. This task can be divided into two main sub-tasks: the extraction of note onset times and the estimation of different pitches. The extraction of note onset times is typically achieved through rigorous heuristic processing of the raw data.

There are various methods available for this problem, ranging from simple pause detection to more complex statistical models. In this article, we focus on the intermediate part of the problem—pitch estimation or pitch tracking. The goal of pitch tracking is to assign a pitch value to each detected note, resulting in a sequence of pitch values that corresponds to the original music.

Accurate age estimates are essential for understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise stellar ages is quite challenging due to the complex differences in luminosity and temperature. For instance, while the turn-off age of main-sequence stars can be determined using luminosity measurement techniques, such as theoretical isochrones and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods are not easily extendable when convection requirements become significant. Additionally, although asteroseismic observations can help us understand the fine structure of evolution, analyzing real data for each target requires detailed models and parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative methods to estimate ages for a large and effective sample of stars. Gyrochronology offers another approach for age estimation based on the decay rate of magnetic activity, which is driven by the dynamo effect in the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003).

On one hand, lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) provides us with crucial insights into non-perturbative interactions. However, most current calculations are limited to ground state hadrons. On the other hand, experimental observations of excited states extend beyond the predictions of the quark model, further stimulating exploration into their internal structures. For instance, new scalar particles in the 1.4-1.7 GeV range offer different information regarding their internal structures. Notably, some of these newly discovered resonances cannot be easily accommodated within the traditional quark model. Therefore, a more detailed investigation is warranted. In this study, we will systematically explore the properties, masses, and coupling constants of scalar mesons below 2 GeV using QCD sum rules, with a particular emphasis on the existence of f0(1370).",

Additionally, it was found that adjusting contact parameters through software can refine the densification behavior. Finally, we demonstrate how the microstructure evolves with increasing rainfall under two different contact conditions. Powder compaction has been extensively studied due to its significance in industrial applications, such as the production of tablets or metal parts through hot pressing techniques. However, despite these efforts, many unresolved scenarios remain to explain the mechanisms of densification behavior under platform loads. To understand the phenomena occurring within compacted materials, several literature studies were conducted, revealing important information about microstructural evolution. However, experiments cannot thoroughly explore local interactions under different loads. Therefore, numerical methods based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) have become an alternative choice for studying the mechanical behavior of particle systems. These DEM-based methods allow us to investigate the behavior of particles in large assemblies and provide valuable insights into micro-mechanical responses. For example, modifications by Salon show that the macro stress-strain curves obtained from simultaneous testing can be adjusted when using realistic contact parameters.",

This issue becomes even more complicated when considering modified equations, such as those associated with matter fields.

One important technique is to reconstruct the Schwarzschild solution into another solution via what is known as a non-full transformation. This transformation preserves certain geometric properties of the spacetime while also maintaining physical significance. For instance, if the transformed solution satisfies the Einstein equations, then the original solution must also satisfy them. In this context, we utilize non-full transformations to study solutions to the Einstein equations in order to obtain solutions for static axisymmetric spacetimes: specifically, those that acknowledge at least two independent excess fields in spacetime, whose orbits are experimental curves. Static axisymmetric spacetimes play a significant role in astrophysics as they describe the fine fields of rotating celestial bodies, such as stars and planets.",

        "translate_text": "We studied the behavior of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which incorporated various components of magnetohydrodynamics and resistivity. The initial conditions were constructed as follows. First, we utilized the Grad-Shafranov approach to achieve force balance, allowing us to obtain a distribution of different densities in polar coordinates on the surface of the annular structure. We then assumed that the interior of this annular structure had a uniform temperature of T = 1 MK and a pressure of P = 0.1 dyn cm^-2, leading to the development of a three-dimensional model. Additionally, we assumed there were two platforms on either side of the magnetic field: one representing the solar wind flowing out from the bottom, intended to descend at 2 R_sun (where R_sun denotes the solar radius), and the other representing modified solar wind flowing in from the top, intended to descend at 20 R_sun. Finally, we applied random fluctuations to the magnetic field, ensuring that its kinetic energy was comparable to its thermal energy. \n\nDuring our simulation runs, we observed three distinct stages in the evolution of the CME. In Stage I, the magnetic field platforms intertwined due to the interaction of the Lorentz force with the azimuthal component of the magnetic field. At approximately t ~ 50 minutes, when the height reached about 5 R_sun, the rising modified solar wind caused a rapid expansion of the rope's cross-section due to magnetic reconnection with the surrounding labradoodle field and global circulation. This acceleration continued until t ~ 80 minutes when the rope reached its upper limit. In Stage II, the rope expanded rapidly outward while maintaining its delicate shape. After reaching its maximum size at t ~ 90 minutes, the rope began to contract inward again. As a result, the rope became thinner than before but still retained its twisted shape. Meanwhile, the surrounding open field became more curved in the vertical direction near the tip of the rope. These results indicate that the magnetic flux rope experiences a distortion phenomenon after expanding outward beyond its original shape.",

These experiments involve capturing neutral atoms by forming standing wave patterns in two backward-propagating analogous fields that are very closely tuned, thereby creating a deep periodic platform. Cold atomic gases form Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), where all atoms occupy the same quantum state. These systems have garnered significant interest as they provide a platform for exploring fundamental principles of quantum mechanics while also offering opportunities to study novel physical phenomena. For instance, these systems have recently been used to investigate superfluidity, the Josephson effect, Bloch oscillations, Landau-Zener tunneling, and Anderson localization. However, despite numerous theoretical studies, the range of behaviors exhibited by these systems remains difficult to predict. One reason for the unpredictability of these systems is that their required components are time-dependent. In fact, due to the non-resonant intensity of the laser platform, the amplitude of the payment varies periodically on a timescale comparable to the experimental parameters. Consequently, the differential spectrum of the system becomes non-periodic, complicating the resolution of the Schrödinger equation.",

This approach is based on the elements of integrability techniques, calculating the spectrum of anomalous dimensions, and then using it as input for recursive relations to compute the number of states at each level of the Bethe ansatz. We compare our results with exact answers for small values and achieve numerical consistency. Finally, we discuss how to go beyond the leading HM results by including corrections arising from the entangled interactions between magnons. \n\nIn the realm of networks, there is considerable interest in understanding the properties of quantum fields modified by integrable systems. An important application involves the study of gauge/gravity duality, where the payment tables computed in one field can be transformed into results in another field through the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, the anomalous spectrum of local gauge-invariant operators plays a crucial role in determining physical observables, such as correlation functions or Wilson loops. Notably, certain parts of the anomalous dimension spectrum can be determined using existing methods, allowing us to make precise predictions about the behavior of physical quantities. However, despite some progress, determining the anomalous part of the family spectrum remains a challenge. \n\nThe aim of this research is to develop computational tools to investigate the anomalous dimension spectrum of operators in N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory (SYMT). This will enable us to further validate the AdS/CFT conjecture and consider the possibility of introducing non-perturbative components in strongly coupled gauge theories. Our main finding is that the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in SYMT is described by the Bethe ansatz. Thus, the calculation of the spectrum reduces to solving a set of coupled differential equations, the solutions of which require sophisticated numerical methods.",

The primary focus of research has been on quantum systems described by short-range interaction Hamiltonians, but recent studies have shifted towards other quantum systems. Initial research indicated that when a system is excited, it relaxes to thermal equilibrium after global quenching. However, some studies have shown that this is not generally true for quantum systems, particularly when the system interacts with another reservoir or fictitious entity.

Introduction\nCode division multiple access (CDMA) is widely used in next-generation wireless communication systems due to its efficient spectrum utilization. However, CDMA experiences significant interference among users due to multipath propagation, especially as the number of users increases. To mitigate user interference, multi-user detectors have been proposed. Among these, specific multi-user detectors have garnered attention for their ease of implementation and lower costs. Unfortunately, the performance of these detectors often falls short of optimal multi-user detectors. To enhance their performance, nonlinear multi-user detectors, such as successive interference cancellation or adaptive interference cancellation, have been introduced. These detectors require an accurate understanding of the received signal. Consequently, blind multi-user detectors have been proposed to estimate unknown parameters without any training signals. Although blind multi-user detectors do not require information about the channel state, their performance is generally inferior to that of supervised multi-user detectors. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing multi-user detectors for time-varying channels. As the channel changes over time, detecting transmitted symbols becomes increasingly challenging. Furthermore, if the channel varies rapidly, the difficulty of detection is further exacerbated. Therefore, research on multi-user detectors for rapidly changing channels has become particularly important.",

Studies indicate that the rainfall of TW varies due to different mechanisms, such as: i) intrinsic instability, ii) perturbation-induced instability, or iii) forced oscillations. In many cases, the platforms are uniform during the aging process, meaning all their parameters do not depend on coordinates. However, the aging of certain physical systems exhibits spatial variations. For instance, some fundamental models include heterogeneity in resonant periodic changes. Another factor affecting wave propagation is noise, which can have varying effects depending on whether it is additive or multiplicative.

Therefore, it is crucial to theoretically explain the dependence of the Casimir force on parameters such as plates, scholarships, and velocity.",

This issue becomes even more complex when dealing with intricate many-body systems, such as condensed matter or biological systems, where the number of degrees of freedom involved can be exceedingly large. A theoretical solution is to investigate the simplified dynamics of the system of interest under certain measurement requirements. In recent years, several studies have focused on developing intermediate methods to address the dynamic characteristics of simplified systems. Among these, the so-called Hierarchical Density Matrix (HDM) is considered a promising alternative to other methods, as it can handle non-Markovian corrections. However, despite the HDM demonstrating accurate predictions in short-time evolution, it falls short in describing the asymptotic behavior of the system. To address this issue, we propose a new form of HDM here, referred to as the Density Hierarchical Structure.",

The intermediate type shows some evidence for alignments perpendicularly to the filamentary structure.  These findings can be explained by tidal torques acting on the gas during its infall into the halo potential well, which is more efficient for early-type than for latetype galaxies.  This effect may also explain why we do not see any significant alignment between the shapes of dark matter haloes themselves. Our results suggest that the observed alignments of galaxies could be caused by large-scale gravitational fields rather than being primordial effects. In this work we study how the shape of dark matter halos affects the distribution of satellite galaxies around them. Using N-body simulations, we investigate whether there exists a correlation between the orientation of the major axis of the host halo and the position angle of satellites relative to it.

We propose using Keck/NIRSPEC for near-infrared spectroscopic observations to detect the star formation activity in these galaxies, which have masses between 3 x 10^11 and 5 x 10^11 Msun. Most of our targets exhibit significant starburst activity, primarily reflected in their equivalent width of the OIII emission line and strong Balmer decrement, indicating the presence of modified interstellar medium regions. Through Spitzer/IRAC photometric measurements, we found that most of these systems have colors consistent with the expected evolutionary stars in the phone-infrared spectrum. However, two of our samples are bluer than this trend, suggesting the possible presence of obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) components.",

Experiments have demonstrated how delicate quantum systems evolve in their ground state while remaining in a non-equilibrium state due to sudden changes in parameters. In this context, we consider scenarios where the system is rapidly cooled during intentional transitions. For instance, if the initial shock is applied to a harmonic trap, the atoms will freely expand once the confinement is released. Alternatively, the system can be initialized in its ground state and then rapidly altered in some other platform (e.g., a magnetic field). In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will critically depend on whether the system is approaching equilibrium. If the latter is true, the system will relax into a metastable state whose characteristics cannot be inferred from the requirements of the equilibrium state.",

Introduction Note\nThe properties of liquids and materials of interest require complex components, as these modified Commonwealth stamps exhibit intricate structures and dynamics. Density functional theory is interpreted in statistical mechanics as a promising tool for solving many problems. It allows for the differentiation of equilibrium prompts by minimizing a primary family platform relative to the number density distribution. A class known as the Salon-Density Functional (FMD) was initially proposed by Rosenfeld. In their research, they applied it only to dense fluids with similar characteristics, but recent extensions have been made for more complex soft objects, such as ellipsoids, rods, dumbbells, spheroids, and family spots of HM. However, most of this work has focused on uniaxially symmetric cases, with relatively little research on more general situations. Here, we consider a system of rigid alignment.",

It describes the dynamic behavior of particles along a chain of L positions, following these rules: each position i (i = 1, …, L) can accommodate at most one particle; if position i is unoccupied, a particle jumps to the right at a certain rate; otherwise, it remains stationary. If position i has another particle, that particle cannot move until the first one leaves. Due to its steady state exhibiting a variety of distinct characteristics, ASEP has attracted considerable research interest. In certain scenarios, particles enter the system from the far left and exit from the far right at a specific rate. For instance, when the modification parameter β = 1/2, the steady state is independent of the initial configuration. On the other hand, when the interpretation parameter exceeds β, the steady state exhibits phase separation. Additionally, when the parameter is less than β, shock waves appear in the steady state platform. These features make ASEP a compelling subject for research.",

It is well-known that the presence of an external environment can lead to the loss of entanglement. Therefore, understanding the evolution of entanglement in different environments is essential for both theoretical and experimental research. In previous studies, much work has focused on the entanglement dynamics of quantum systems. However, most prior research has only addressed Markovian processes or specific types of entangled states. Recently, the authors investigated the entanglement dynamics of two Gaussian states. They found that if a system undergoes amplitude damping (or breathing damping), the entanglement decays exponentially; whereas when another system experiences strong dissipation, the decay is slower. Furthermore, they showed that entanglement can periodically revive. These results were primarily based on numerical simulations.

However, obtaining accurate estimates of polarization can be challenging due to instrumental factors such as depolarization or calibration errors. This issue becomes more pronounced when analyzing faint signals with low signal-to-noise ratios. To overcome these difficulties, the authors employed statistical techniques to estimate the intrinsic polarization of the sample. For instance, Hovatta et al. (2012) investigated the distribution of Stokes parameters, using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the values and standard deviations of these parameters. They found that the average polarization levels were higher than those reported by other authors analyzing similar datasets. Similarly, Lister and Homan (2005) studied the polarization of bright quasars using a maximum likelihood method, fitting the Stokes parameters' histograms with Gaussian distributions. Their research indicated the simultaneous presence of both circular and linear polarization components in the polarization of quasars.",

Introduction\nMicrolensing is one of the most promising methods for detecting exoplanets, as it can provide not only signals from the lens but also information about the physical characteristics of the planets, without bias from their mass parameters or detailed features of the host stars. However, since the angular size of Einstein's ring is much smaller than the actual size of the gravitational lens, continuous observations through ground-based telescopes are required. Consequently, many researchers tend to choose the central region of the Milky Way for intensive observations during collective interference periods. As a result, more than 100 exoplanet candidates have been discovered using this method, of which only four planets have been confirmed.\n\nMicrolensing events arise from differences in lensing effects over short time scales. When a background source is close to a foreground lens candidate, the light from the source is bent by the lens's gravity, leading to an amplification of the source's light flux. If a planet is present near the lens, the light curve of the lens will be affected by the perturbation caused by the planet. Since the strength of the perturbation is closely related to the projected distance between the lens and the planet, the presence of the planet can be confirmed by analyzing the characteristics of the lens's light curve.",

Second, we will apply our results to the graviton correction components of the Schwarzschild excess black hole, taking into account the modifications introduced by the presence of additional degrees of freedom. Our study closely follows the explanations in reference 1, where the authors investigated the impact of a massless scalar field on the standard model, particularly the emission rate of Hawking radiation.",

We first pointed out that the interpretation of viscosity is related to household settlement payments, while thermal conductivity is the opposite. In the introduction, we highlighted that transport phenomena, such as viscosity and thermal conductivity, play a crucial role in astrophysics, geophysics, and other fields. These phenomena strongly depend on the microscopic dynamics of the system under rainfall conditions.

Particles of different species do not directly interact; their interactions are modified by the presence of a background medium.

The study of single quantum differences has become more complex as it allows us to explore pseudo-landing scenarios, which in some cases do not yield analytical solutions. The most common experimental setup involves confining bosons or fermions along a spatial platform within a harmonic trap, leading to quasi-one-dimensional behavior. However, it has recently become possible to tightly confine these systems, transforming their landing into one dimension. For instance, experiments using Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have shown that confinement in narrow components can lead to phase transitions of matter. These phase transitions include superfluidity, supersolidity, Luttinger liquids, Tonks-Girardeau gases, and Mott insulators. Therefore, developing theoretical tools to predict the changes in these new phases will be highly beneficial. One of the main challenges in studying strongly coupled quantum systems is determining whether a dark configuration is energetically favorable. If the answer is yes, we refer to this configuration as a metastable state. Conversely, if the answer is no, the configuration is deemed unstable. Instability is often caused by spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

The most widely accepted model of evolution assumes that new species evolve over time via vertical transmission -that is, they pass their genetic material down directly from parent to offspring  2  .\nHowever, there are many cases where we cannot assume that evolution proceeds strictly vertically; instead, some form of horizontal gene transfer (HG T) occurs between two lineages  3  , resulting in what is known as reticulate evolution  4  .

This was achieved through a novel dynamic approach that calculates the minimum number of reticulate events required to explain the input data for each taxon.

However, in certain cases, we cannot explain genetic phenomena solely through vertical transmission; for example, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurs between two lineages, leading to reticulate evolution. For instance, if a virus infects a host cell, its genes will be regulated within the host cell; similarly, if one species hybridizes with another, the offspring will inherit genetic information from both parents. In these cases, the effects of HGT result in a reticulate relationship among descendants rather than a simple linear lineage.",

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies.

These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics.

However, there are several open questions, such as the masses of the fermions in the SM and neutrino oscillations, which cannot be explained within the framework of the SM. To address these issues, extended theories beyond the SM have been proposed. In particular, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) offer a potential solution to the aforementioned problems.

One of the most profound approaches is the target space formulation, where all degrees of freedom can be handled at once without any truncation or fictitious elements. Another approach is the background field method. Recent studies have shown that these two methods yield equivalent results. On the other hand, there is a theory known as the pure spinor formulation.

However, among all known planetary systems, only about 10% contain such planets. Most planets have been discovered through Doppler spectroscopy or imaging techniques. In comparison, only a very small number of low-mass planets have been found, as their brightness is typically lower than that of more easily detectable planets. Consequently, there is a significant disparity in the distribution of exoplanets, ranging from Earth-like planets to Neptune-like planets, particularly among those located farther from Earth. Therefore, the search for these low-mass planets becomes especially important, as they can provide valuable information about the formation of planetary systems. An effective detection method is to use high angular resolution telescopes like HST for observations. Such observations allow us to study the dynamics of the host HM system.

The majority of our sample is comprised of previously uncatalogued sources; however, we recover many known variable sources such as blazars and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our results demonstrate the power of combining large amounts of archival VLA data into one coherent dataset. This work was supported by NSF grant AST-0907860. In this Letter, we present an analysis of all available archived Very Large Array (V LA) observations taken since 1990. These data were collected during various observing programs aimed primarily at studying distant galaxies or nearby star forming regions. However, they contain valuable information about fainter transient phenomena occurring within our Galaxy.

In fact, it was through observations of galaxy clusters that we first discovered evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter  1  .

For example, while current observational techniques allow us to measure accurately the total amount of light emitted by a galaxy cluster, it remains difficult to determine how much of this light comes from stars inside individual galaxies versus diffuse gas located outside them  5  . Similarly, although we can estimate fairly well the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster using various methods  6  , it is not clear what fraction of this mass is associated with visible objects like galaxies  7, 8  . Finally, even though we know that galaxy clusters contain large amounts of hot plasma  9  , it is unclear whether this material is gravitationally bound to the system  10  .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we will use two different datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory  11  : the sample of galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et",

This result suggests that the rainfall in the ICM may be influenced by factors beyond the modified models.\n\nKeywords: galaxy clusters, dark matter halos, gravitational lensing, mass-to-light ratio, X-ray emissions\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe theory of modified gravity has played a significant role in our understanding of cosmology over the past few decades. In fact, it was through the observation of dense galaxy clusters that we first confirmed the existence of non-baryonic matter. Today, galaxy clusters are widely used to study the evolution of the universe and are considered to have significant implications for cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass-to-light ratios of galaxy clusters. However, despite considerable progress, some fundamental questions remain unanswered satisfactorily. For instance, although advanced observational techniques allow us to measure the total mass of galaxy clusters, it remains challenging to determine how much of that mass comes from baryonic matter concentrated within galaxies versus how much comes from diffuse gas located outside the galaxies. Similarly, while we can estimate the total gravitational mass of galaxy clusters using thermal components, the relationship between these components and baryonic matter is still unclear. Furthermore, although we know that the composition of hot gas plays a crucial role in galaxy clusters, it is uncertain whether these gases are gravitationally bound to the system.\n\nTo address these issues, we will utilize two different datasets from the Chandra Observatory: samples of different galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et al.",
