We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

This satellite was found during the Galactic microlensing survey. The initial tracking of the satellite was announced in 2018, and it was subsequently confirmed with comprehensive six-level phase-path information in 2019. It exhibits a highly eccentric orbit around the Milky Way, often straying far from the heart of the spiral galaxy. It may have been captured by the Milky Way's heavy matter halo, and in the future, it could potentially be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy.

However, the computation of Bayesian deformer models is often challenging due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. Recently, variational inference (VI) algorithm has been proposed and shown to be efficient in calculating the approximate posterior distribution in Bayesian deformer models. In this paper, we develop a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) based on VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency. The proposed method is firstly derived in a general Bayesian deformable model, and then applied to some specific Bayesian deformer models for demonstration. Our experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our method is more efficient than the existing VI algorithm and comparable with the state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm in calculating Bayesian deformer models. The primary contributions of this work are two-fold: (1) We propose a SAA-based VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency of Bayesian deformer models. Our method is applicable to a broad range of Bayesian deformer models and shows higher efficiency than existing VI algorithm in some cases; (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on real world datasets.

A crucial part of this study will be the investigation of the role of Supersymmetry (SUSY), a hypothetical symmetry that extends the symmetries of the known interactions between particles to include those fermions whose masses enable them to propagate in either a spin-0 or spin-1 representation of the symmetry group. One of the most popular models that has enjoyed great success in reproducing the observed particle spectrum is the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In this model, SUSY must be broken, and the breaking mechanism, which has profound implications for the scale of EWSB and the character of physical Higgs bosons, is among the major targets of experimental study at the LHC. The MSSM Higgs sector comprises two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons, Hplus and Hminus. A crucial test of this model is the determination of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the observed Higgs bosons. The large sparticle masses predicted by the mSUGRA model motivate a particular benchmark region known as the focus point region, which exhibits relatively light Higgs bosons, in particular a 126 GeV Higgs boson. The observation of a Higgs boson with these characteristics would be a strong indication of supersymmetry and would greatly strengthen the case for this mysterious energy scale.

The GeMn columns were grown by chemical vapor deposition on Ge(100) substrates at 300 °C. The average diameter of the columns is about 30 nm. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging demonstrates that the GeMn columns are formed by accumulation of smaller grains at the end of larger ones. Transmission electron microscopy tomography analysis shows that these small grains are enriched in Mn with respect to the substrate composition. The GeMn composition strongly varies across the columns. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements show that GeMn columns incorporate significant amounts of interstitial Mn atoms, that are probably responsible for the ferromagnetic character of the material. The self-organization process during GeMn column growth allows tailoring of the GeMn composition and structure, which strongly influences the magnetic properties of the material.

In the realm of radio astronomy, phase stability is a prerequisite for achieving the coherence necessary for precise astronomical observations. This coherence is achieved by referencing the output to a clear and stable independent source, such as a hydrogen maser. The stability of the astronomical observation itself is determined by the number of jitters that do not compromise the system's coherence. To characterize the phase stability of the IRAM 30-yard telescope, we employed a phase-referenced wave at 10.5 cm in a dual-source Bracewell discriminator image. This method allowed us to estimate the phase stability between two signals every 20 minutes with a precision of 1.1 millias RMS. We have also demonstrated how to calculate the equivalent closed-loop transition function of the system, which is significant for the control community as this type of observation is also used to measure the stability of aircraft like the Airbus A300 or satellites.

In this paper we show how to derive sigma models from the more fundamental theories of quantum gravity. We use the background independent quantization of 2+1 gravity, Vasiliev theory, to derive sigma models for interfaces in (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. This provides a geometrical interpretation of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity dynamical variables as an (2+1)-dimensional analogue of the relativistic membrane. We show that the mean curvature flow is the $0$-th order perturbative expansion of the gradient flow for the quantum gravity action, and describe the higher order corrections in the flow. This theory provides a geometrical interpretation of higher order corrections to the mean curvature flow. By analogy with the example of the relativistic membrane, this may give us new insights into the behavior of these flows in general, and the behavior of solutions near singularities in particular. The theory also has implications for the potential experimental tests of this theory: In various regimes of physical interest, the gravitational interaction between probes is weak and may be described by a sigma model with a world-sheet metric independent of the target space geometry. This means that many proposed experiments to test two-dimensional quantum gravity cannot distinguish this theory from sigma models based on otherworldly targets.

LPD not only guarantees the remote state transfer with high fidelity, but also limits the server to a finite number of classical queries. In particular, for a 2-qubit state, LPD with BCC only requires the server to perform one query; for a 3-qubit state, the number of queries is two; and for an n-qubit state, the number of queries is O(n). In addition, we further analyze the secure quantum channel condition under LPD and present a tighter bound in the general case.

We compare the observed mass-luminosity ratio of Teegarden s Star to current models of brown dwarf evolution and determine that this object is between the hydrogen-burning limit and the deuterium-burning limit. Future observations of Teegarden s Star will allow for further testing of these models, as well as the models  ability to predict the luminosities of ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion. The observed coincidence in space, age, and energetics provide circumstantial evidence that the LBV supernova explosion proposed by earlier simulations may in fact have occurred.",

By combining our results with previous work of Kevin Hutchinson, we deduce that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of surfaces. Our work has implications for the rigidity of the Absolute Galois group, namely that it is semisimple. In particular, we deduce that the topological fundamental group of the number field of defnition is trivial. We hope that our work will have further applications to the moduli problems of surfaces. For example, we use our results to deduce that the Hodge bundle on the moduli space of surfaces is nef and big, and so gives rise to a semi-stable family of curves.

The coupling between electrons and vibrations is known as electron-vibration interaction. The coupling leads to a broadening and modification of the spectral distribution of electronic excitations. The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Here, we present the first calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant in covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion. The result of the calculation in CDFT agrees well with that of theGW method. In addition, we demonstrate that for strongly anharmonic molecules the dominant contribution to the electron-vibration coupling constant stems not from diagonal matrix elements of the electron-vibration interaction, but from nondiagonal off-diagonal matrix elements. These off-diagonal matrix elements are induced by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface. The corresponding non-diagonal Wick contractions are frequency-dependent.

        "original_text": "On the 150th anniversary of the birth of theoretical physicistClerk Maxwell, a novel form of light-based quantum simulation, known as optical lattices, was recently proposed1,2. By arranging laser beams in a specific pattern and tuning their relative intensities, it is possible to simulate magnetic domains, quasiparticles, and even short-ranged interactions in a system of ultra-cold atoms trapped in this optical potential3,4,5. In this way, quantum simulations, which traditionally require near-perfect isolation from external disturbances, can be performed in lattices which are themselves capable of sensing and responding to perturbations.

Although it has not been observed yet, according to recent hypotheses, the Dalitz plotting analysis may help differentiate between various models of D decay.\n\nIn the experiment, the FOCUS detector, a small cylindrical box of equipment, was utilized. It is located within the complex of Reserve cyclotrons at Fermilab and was employed to perform a Dalitz plotting investigation on the D+ to K- pi+ pi+ decay. The results presented in this note were obtained during the data collection period in 2002.",

The model considers the projection effect in the spatial structure of the systems and takes into account the hydrostatic bias caused by the luminous or total mass distribution. We apply our model to interpret the SZ profiles obtained with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and show that the ACT-derived SZ surface brightness profiles can be well fitted by the self-similar form if certain scaling relations are imposed. We also show that there are systematics in the SZ measurements due to the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beam-smoothing effect and propose an empirical method to reduce these systematics. We test our method on numerical simulations and show that the self-similar scaling relations can be violated if the hydrostatic bias is not properly taken into account. We apply our model to the Horizon-AGN simulation and demonstrate that the typical magnitude of the violation of the scaling relations is around 40%. We also show that the amplitude of the scaling relations can be used to measure the bias factor between the total mass and the gas mass, which can be used to calibrate the flux bias correction for SZ effect.

The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

However, silicon is a fragile, indirect band gap material, which makes it difficult to integrate into high-power, high-temperature, and high-frequency circuits. Graphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, provides an ideal contender for the future electronics. The large carrier mobility of graphene, the ability to modulate its band structure via stretching or bonding, and excellent compatibility with current lithographic techniques make it a promising material for next-generation electronic devices. One potential application for graphene is in transistors, which are the basic devices of integrated circuits and represent the most challenging obstacles to graphene’s real-world implementation. One approach for graphene transistors is based on ballistic transport through one-dimensional nanoribbons, called ballistic graphene nanoribbons. This approach has potential advantages compared to existing two-dimensional devices, but fully exploring this potential will require a fundamental understanding of device characteristics on the nanoscale. Here, we present a full quantum real-space study of ballistic graphene nanoribbon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. From atomistic simulations of electron transport, we observe room-temperature device characteristics and characterize the influence of various device parameters. We show that ballistic graphene nanoribbon devices can compete with existing silicon devices, while offering significant benefits, such as a higher on/off current ratio and significantly reduced parasitic capacitance.

The behavior of these surface flows is greatly influenced by the characteristics of the underlying surface, particularly by the intensity of bottom friction. In the absence of bottom friction, these currents consistently propagate towards the right and eventually transform into undular bores after a certain distance. However, when bottom friction is considered, small currents can propagate both towards the right and left, creating spirals or evolving into undular bores.\n\nThis behavior is explored using numerical and asymptotic techniques, with a strong agreement found between the two methods. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the dispersion relation for undular bores can be derived as an expansion around the KdV system, and a truncation of this expansion has been identified. This truncation is valid when the undular source moves significantly faster than the normal speed of wave propagation.",

        "rewrite_text": "The symmetries present in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and asymptotically flat spacetimes suggest that their conserved coordinates must comply with certain linearly independent differential equations. Specifically, conserved charges in AdS at the third and higher levels must adhere to a system of first-order differential equations with specific conditions, while for asymptotically flat spacetimes in four and higher dimensions, they must fulfill a different class of differential expressions with requirements.\n\nIn this brief communication, we establish several identities linking the conserved fields of these spacetimes that satisfy either first or second-class differential expressions with limits. Our identities appear to be novel and have not been discussed in previous literature. This note extends our previous work, where we explored the three interconnected Anti-de Sitter fields (AdS_3) in (3+1) D and the four interconnected asymptotically flat spacetime in (4+1) D. The primary objective of writing this brief note is to consolidate all these findings into a single document.\n\nPreviously published by G. Chakraborty and S.

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass. We also compare our findings to those of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the peak metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters is broadly consistent with the highest values seen in simulated galaxy cluster cores. However, at present, it is not clear whether observed abundance trends with host spheroid mass can be reconciled with the highest-redshift galaxies in the simulations. Our results offer new empirical constraints on the efficiency of chemical enrichment in galaxy clusters, as well as improved empirical scaling relations for the metal-rich Milky Way globular cluster system.

The resulting difference in propagation speeds leads to a non-zero probability of the system to enter into an excited state of the potential. We call this phenomenon super-Speedup. The probability of super-Speedup is numerically shown to increase with the strength of the surface potential and decrease with the wave packet momentum. Super-Speedup may offer a novel pathway for protecting quantum information from decoherence. An atom in vacuum decays to vacuum, however if the atom is subjected to a surface this can lead to an enhanced probability of the atom to transition to an excited state. We demonstrate this phenomenon, termed super-Speedup, and show that it is due to the difference in propagation speeds of the decaying wave packet and the induced surface potential. We compute the probability of super-Speedup and find that it increases with the strength of the surface potential and decreases with the momentum of the wave packet. Super-Speedup may offer a novel pathway for protecting quantum information from decoherence.",

Super-speedup could potentially offer a new approach to safeguard quantum information from decoherence. During atomic inflation, an atom transitions towards vacuum, and when exposed to a surface, there is an elevated likelihood of it transitioning to an excited state. We verify this behavior, referred to as super-speedup, which is attributed to the variance in propagation speeds between the decaying wave and the generated surface field. We calculate the likelihood of super-speedup and observe that it varies with the surface field's intensity and diminishes with the force of wave propagation.

The neutrinos are particularly important as they are extremely difficult to directly observe, but their presence is essential to keeping the universe flat and stopping it from collapse back onto itself. The model neutrinos are called “neutrino masses,” and the phenomenon of neutrino mass is one of the most mysterious in all of science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detected a significant decrease in the speed of neutrinos moving through space-time, which suggested that neutrinos might have a tiny but non-zero mass. Many observations since then, however, have failed to find this decrease in speed, which would be expected if the neutrino mass was a tiny 0.1eV. On the other hand, various extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos might have a non-zero mass. These include the see-saw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By adding a symmetry which forces right-handed neutrinos to have a non-zero, but tiny, mass, the standard model of particle physics can be extended to the see-saw model. Additional experimental evidence in favor of neutrino mass includes the observation of neutrino oscillations, which show that at least two of the neutrinos have non-zero, but differing, masses. Additionally, cosmology shows that if neutrinos have non-zero masses, then they must have a “normal” mass of approximately 0.05eV or less. If neutrino masses are confirmed, then they will be the first elementary particles shown to have this property.

The molecular cloud is located in the southern celestial hemisphere around 5.5 kiloyears away, which makes it the most remote object for which a spatial mapping of thedistribution of molecular gas has been performed so far. Using the Nobeyama radio observatory, we have mapped the carbon monoxidedistribution in a sample of 25 nearby spiral galaxies and found that barred spiral galaxies have a larger quantityof molecular gas than non-barred spiral galaxies at the same optical luminosity. We propose that the strongerbars, which are associated with bigger bulges, stabilize the potential, and this in turn promotes theformation of more molecular gas. It is now well known that barred spirals are more abundant in the universe than non-barred spirals, which indicates that bars are important mechanisms in the evolution of galaxies. Our finding supports the view that bars promote the evolution of the host galaxies, probably by promoting the transfer of gas to the central region1,2. The gas there forms stable circumnuclear regions and through SF produces new generations of stars, leading to the formation of bigger and bigger bulges. 1 Athanassoula, E.; Parijs, G. *Origin of Bars in Disk Galaxies*.

        "rewrite_text": "The Nobeyama molecular cloud, discovered in 1703 by the Swedish amateur astronomer Georgius Barwick, is a superbionte that today goes by the name of the Nobeyama molecular cloud. This molecular cloud is situated within the southern celestial hemisphere at an approximate distance of 5.5 kiloyears from here. This location makes it the most distant object where a spatial map of the distribution of molecular gas has been conducted. Using the Nobeyama radio telescope, we have mapped out the distribution of carbon monoxide in a sample of 25 small spiral molecules and found that barred spiral galaxies tend to have a greater quantity of molecular gas than un-lined spiral molecules at the same visual luminosity. We propose that stronger bars, which are associated with larger bulges, stabilize the field, thereby encouraging the formation of more molecular gas. It is now widely accepted that spiral galaxies are more abundant in the universe than un-lined spirals, suggesting that bars play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. Our findings support the belief that bars influence the progress of their host galaxies, possibly by promoting the transition of gas to specific regions. This gas forms small circumnuclear regions and through star formation produces different successions of stars, leading to the formation of larger and larger bulges. According to Athanassoula and Parijs's research on the origin of bars in disk galaxies, as well as other studies cited such as Subramaniam et al.'s two-pronged approach to understanding the origin of bars, further evidence suggests that bars are indeed key mechanisms in the progression of galaxies.",

Calculations were performed using the method of rapid adiabaticfollowing, which permits the description of non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a mixed normal-Wigner representation Hamiltonian. The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position. These two structures differ by the orientation of the molecular axis. In the following, we will refer to the 2x2 O2 structure as “bent” and to the 1x2 O2 structure as “linear”. Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments. This excitation could also lead to the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localised on top of the linear structure is initially involved in the dissociation process, in good agreement with available experimental data.

These simulations, however, cannot reproduce the full distribution of galaxy properties at both low and high redshift. It has been suggested that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars may play a role in regulating star formation in their host galaxies. In this paper, we present high resolution, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of a sub-set of galaxies in a single volume of a large, modern simulation, in which a simple model for radio-mode feedback is included. The model is characterized by a constant Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole, which is adjusted so that the AGN contributes a specified amount of radio heating to the interstellar medium. We have selected a simulation which is volume-limited and resolves all galaxies above a given mass, and which includes the effects of stellar feedback, AGN feedback and the evolving gas properties from the larger simulation. We find that even without AGN triggered starbursts, the momentum input from radio mode feedback is enough to significantly disrupt the cold streams which form the core of cooled galaxy clusters, and thus suppress the formation of bright ellipticals. At the same time, this feedback is not sufficient to disrupt the clusters completely. In lower mass galaxies, below the critical cluster mass, we do not see significant suppression of star formation, although we do find a decrease in the concentration of stellar metallicity and stellar density.

First, we calculate the perturbation correction to the equation of state of the ideal hard-sphere fluid. This correction is exponentially small when the wall-fluid density ratio is small and the separation between the walls is much larger than the particle diameter.

The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions.

The process relies on the removal of a thin layer of material from one substrate to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. Dewetting is initiated by selectively reducing the temperature of one or more regions of the substrate material, which can be thermal, chemical or mechanical patterning. One typical dewetting scenario is the removal of a thin layer of material from a bulk semi-conductor to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. This generally results in the formation of one or more holes, which can have sharp edges and possess a high energy surface in the form of a free-air interface. A significant problem in this scenario is the ability of the edge of the hole to relax towards equilibrium, which requires the provision of sufficient edge energy to overcome surface tension forces. In this work, we perform a full-scale hydrodynamic calculation of the relaxation of an initially circular dewetting hole, which is constrained at its edges and is free to move in two dimensions. We compare the evolution of the hole shape and energy with both circular and elliptic equilibrium solutions, and examine the importance of various physical mechanisms for relaxation, including bulk diffusion, convection and surface tension.",

These emerging spacetimes have been demonstrated to emerge in a hierarchical manner from consistent concepts within a higher-level spacetime, which incorporates standard relativity in d dimensions along with a scalar field.\n\nIn this book, we illustrate that for a specific set of interactions between the scalar and gravitational fields, this higher-dimensional colored spacetime exhibits a greater symmetry. This concept emerges in a higher volume as a dual field concept with doubled spacetime components. Specifically, we consider the notion of a scalar field with an anti-simple internal interaction within a d+1 dimensional Minkowski fiber field.

Date: January 30th, 2023 Author: Jose Antonio Burroni Title: Dual Field Theories in (d-1)+1 Emergent Spacetimes Derived from a Unifying Field Theory in d+2 Spacetime. Abstract: As mentioned recently, the idea of an emerging spacetime has been employed to integrate gravity with other physical fields, predominantly quantum mechanics. These emerging spacetimes are seen to arise systematically from higher-level spacetime concepts, utilizing standard relativity in d dimensions combined with a scalar field.\n\nIn this book, we illustrate that for specific interactions between scalar and gravitational fields, this higher-dimensional colored spacetime shows increased symmetry. This results in a higher-volume dual field concept with doubled spacetime components. Specifically, we explore the concept of a scalar field with an anti-simple internal interaction within a d+1 Minkowski fiber field as an example. The related movement equations share equivalence with empty spacetime.\n\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that introducing a differently coupled scalar field enhances system symmetry and creates a system within a d-volume with an (d-1) + 1 dual Minkowski spacetime emergence. This approach offers non-standard solutions depicting black spaces with distinct horizons and determined by black hole charge's extended scale.\n\nMoreover, our traditional solutions pinpoint a smoothly linked smaller region beyond the black hole map. In this area, the previously connected d+1 spacetime is gradually extended, reflected through the construction of a solitonic wave linking the white hole map with this continuous region. By studying solutions encompassing one black hole and a cosmological background, we observe that under specific charge conditions, these horizons converge into a triple-hole configuration.\n\nOur calculations reveal that this dual relativity model's black space entropy aligns with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the tri-horizon solution scenario. Ultimately, our research indicates that universal solutions encompass hot fields of Reissner-Nordström in higher dimensions, where relativity simplifies to five dimensions.\n\nIn conclusion, we present our findings and propose future extensions to further explore these concepts.",

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface. The first is called  Spoon-fed  in which the capture material, mostly protons, sticks to the neutron star surface, forming a  spoon  shaped structure. Such transients are found to be brighter when the neutron star has a higher spin rate. The second is  Indirect  in which the capture material, mostly electrons and protons, forms a  cloud  around the neutron star.

The extended abstract not only presents the main topic, but also provides a contextual background and general observations on the subject. The term \"neutron star\" refers to a celestial object predominantly composed of neutrons, subatomic particles with an atomic number corresponding to the nuclei of individual entities. These stars are exceptionally massive structures, weighing more than the Sun but contained within a volume comparable to or exceeding a cubic kilometer. Their formation is the result of a supernova explosion that condenses approximately 99% of a star's matter into its core, achieving such extreme densities due to the significant weight of neutrons compared to regular molecules. As the fusion process nears the core, the weak force that maintains it weakens, leading to a loss of support once fusion reaches approximately 2-3 solar ages. This results in a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star explosion.\n\nThe majority of neutron stars are found in close binary systems with other neutron sources or, more rarely, black holes. These systems are referred to as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are desirable for research as they offer us a dual perspective to explore neutron star systems. One perspective is the quiescent state, where the neutron star orbits a smaller companion and does not emit X-rays. The other involves transient changes in the neutron star's X-ray emission, known as an outburst, for various reasons. Transitioning between these two states in LMXBs provides valuable insights. For instance, we have recently found that brighter outbursts are associated with an increase in the neutron star's spin cycle. Conversely, when the dwarf source is quiescent but its X-ray emission is slightly brighter than usual, its color rate is observed to be higher when the source is significantly dimmer. These behavioral differences suggest a two-state model for LMXBs' behavior.\n\nIn this model, there are two forms of accretion onto the decay system. The differences between them are explained by different methods of depositing collected material onto the surface of the decaying star.

For each hypothesis, we present the formal framework and show the appropriate range of oscillation parameters for three representative sets of small neutrino mass splittings.\n\nWe explore potential models for sterile neutrino generation that predict distinct changes across the three sterile neutrino generation schemes. Ultimately, we conclude by summarizing the implications of the latest sterile neutrino results in terms of the proposed schemes, with contact information provided for further inquiry: mmaltoni@fnal.gov at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, IL 60510.",

Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space.

Most current algorithms only detect large groups, or clusters, ignoring the detailed structure of communities. Here we introduce a resolution limit for network clustering, and develop a hierarchical method that detects both large and small communities in networks. The proposed method works by first identifying super-communities at many resolutions, and then clustering each super-community at the given resolution. We validate our method on random and real-world networks, and show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

Mucha, and Mihaela Van con, “Network Communities with a High Resolution,” arXiv:1711.09755 (December 13, 2017). There has been a recent resurgence of interest in network clustering, sparked by the development of a wide variety of network data, as well as the ubiquity of network datasets in other fields, such as social media and biology. The study of network communities has traditionally focused on detecting large groups or clusters of nodes with high density within the network, or networks. Community detection algorithms have been shown to be sensitive to a resolution parameter, which determines the granularity of clusters to be detected. Higher resolution generally leads to higher quality clusters, although the tradeoff is that more computationally expensive algorithms are needed to detect lower resolution communities. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical method for community detection that identifies both large and small communities at many resolution levels. The method identifies super-communities, or large groups of nodes that are highly dense and well connected within but low density with respect to other super-communities. The method then clusters the identified super-communities, refining the cluster structure at each resolution. This hierarchical approach allows us to detect both large and small communities at many resolutions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on both synthetic and real-world networks, showing that our method is highly accurate in detecting clusters and outperforms state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.",

The other four, called strange, up, down and bottom, occur in forms called hadrons, which combine to form matter only through the strong force. The strong force binds the quarks within protons and neutrons in hadrons. The binding energy of a hadron is called its mass. Quarks are believed to be particles that behave like tiny magnets and each come in six different  colors  (representations of the symmetry group SU(3) in quantum chromodynamics, or QCD). The six different  colors  of a quark correspond to the six pieces of a mathematical object called an octet. Each octet flavor has a characteristic fraction of charge and mass, which makes it possible to define the names up and down quarks (theCharge is 2/3 and 1/3 their mass). The remaining flavors, strange, up, down and bottom, each have a corresponding named hadron. These six hadron names can be combined to formlarger hadrons. For example, the bottom quark carries a small amount of the bottom hadron s charge, so a bottom hadron is a weakly interacting particle containing a bottom quark. Within the standard model of particle physics, quarks are assumed to be point particles, and the strong force between them is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The current theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), successfully describes many features of hadrons, including their spectra and decays. One important consequence of the QCD is that the up and down quarks will never appear alone but always appear in combinations, called hadrons. This fundamental interaction between quarks is called  confinement . According to the phenomenological quark model, the most fundamental particles in the universe are the up, down and strange quarks and their corresponding hadrons, called hadrons. The strong force that binds the quarks together forms hadrons. Hadronic matter is typical matter, made of hadrons. It is found throughout the universe in planets, stars and galaxies. However, in order to study it, nuclear physicists study particles that are either fragments of hadrons, such as beta particles and pi mesons, or full hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. These nuclei of hydrogen and helium are called ordinary matter. Quarks are also found inside other particles, but their behavior is not well understood. Because they are so much more massive than the quarks that make up ordinary matter, these  sea quarks  are mainly found inside hadrons, which bind them together.

        "rewrite_text": "Quarks are believed to be fundamental particles that interact through the force, known as the strong force. Experimentally, only two of the six quarks - the up and down quarks - exist as solid components within ordinary matter, forming protons and neutrons. The other four quarks - random, up, down, and bottom - exist in the form of hadrons, which mix to create matter exclusively through the strong force. The strong force holds the quarks together within hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. The binding force of a hadron is referred to as its mass. Quarks are considered to be particles that behave like tiny magnets and come in six different \"colors\" (representations of the SU(3) crystal class in quantum chromodynamics or QCD). These six colors of a quark correlate with the pieces of a mathematical puzzle called an octet. Each octet flavor has a distinct charge and weight, which accounts for the naming of the up and down quarks (with charges of 2/3 and 1/3, respectively). The remaining flavors - different, up, down, and bottom - each have distinct named hadrons. These six hadron names can be combined to form even larger hadrons.\n\nFor instance, the bottom quark carries a small portion of the charge of a bottom hadron, making a bottom hadron a weakly embedded molecule containing a bottom quark. In the standard model of particle mechanics, quarks are considered key components, and the interaction between them is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The latest model of strong interactions, QCD, successfully explains numerous features of hadrons, including their spectra and decays. A crucial aspect of QCD is that the up and down quarks rarely exist independently but always in combinations called hadrons. This essential interaction between quarks is known as confinement.\n\nAccording to the phenomenological quark model, the most essential particles in the universe are the up, down, and strange quarks and their corresponding hadrons.

These molecules of hydrogen and helium are referred to as ordinary matter. Quarks can also be found within other molecules, but their behavior is not well understood. Despite their vast size compared to the quarks that make up ordinary matter, true quarks are also found within hadrons, which bind them closely together.\n\nThe proposed theory for the force interaction between them is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density. This provides a mechanism by which the universe can undergo a phase transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of nonequilibrium, or a cooling dominated phase transition.",

However, this model suffers from a key flaw: it treats the universe as a system of events rather than as a system of molecules.

In this model, the photons of the cosmic microwave background emission represent the molecules of boiling water. As the universe cools, these photons have a greater tendency to occupy the lowest-energy states, achieving equilibrium with the cooling universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, these photons no longer maintain equilibrium with quantum fluctuations in the wave, leading them to move away from regions of high density towards regions of lower density.

In this scenario, the universe is like a frozen pond where molecules settle at the bottom but emission signals continue to propagate throughout the universe. As the universe continues to cool in this model, emission currents begin to propagate throughout space while particles settle at the bottom of this pond-like universe, creating regions of both higher and lower densities.

Wind properties and evolution of hot massive stars are key to understand feedback from massive stars in their environment, from the morphological structure of the interstellar medium to the chemical evolution of their host galaxy. Combined high-resolution spectroscopy from VLT-FLAMES allows to determine mass-loss rates from H emission, temperature of the bi-conical winds and thus analyze the evolutionary status of these stars. From the mass-loss rates, Ionic masses can be derived and eventually be used to investigate other properties of the winds, such as ionization degrees and acceleration regions with potential effects on simulations of the feedback into the environment. In this contribution we present the first results on the evolution of hot massive stars in the LMC and the impact of this evolution on the galactic feedback. We confirm previous studies which concluded that the initial mass function (IMF) is top-heavy in the LMC, with respect to the Milky Way. The most massive stars show stronger IMF divergence from the initial mass function (IMF) with increasing age, suggesting that these stars were affected by significant mass-loss episodes. We found more extreme cases of stars with abnormally high nitrogen to carbon (N/C) and nitrogen to oxygen (N/O) abundance ratios, which might be the consequence of a thermohaline mixing process occurring in their winds, an hydrodynamic process taking place in the strong winds of massive stars.",

These materials are composed of quasi-two-dimensional molecules with strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a small spin wavelength and remarkable magnetic properties3,4. Recent neutron scattering experiments5,6 on the quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor α-T-NbSe2 has revealed a low-energy magnetic spectrum that is best characterized as fluctuating antiferromagnetism. This finding was surprising given the observed low temperatures and high transition temperatures for superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, respectively.

Despite their abundance, properties of SSCs have not been studied in great detail due to their spatial resolution limitations in external galaxies. This has recently changed with the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which has allowed the discovery of much fainter SSCs in the centers of nearby galaxies.

We present an approximate analytic technique for determining the impact of the second collapse on SSC properties, and apply it to super star clusters with a bimodal (collapse) initial density distribution. We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles.

        "original_text": "Mechanistic home range analysis (MHRA) is a widely used method for estimating home range size. The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours.

        "original_text": "The astronomical community regularly holds discussions on proposals for new telescopes, and this cycle has now been going on for more than a decade without a new large optical telescope being funded. This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community. Since 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals. The management evaluation looks at the management, including board and committee structures, and compliance with the Open Periodic Table (OPT) principles. The EBT has published evaluation templates for each of these areas, and each submission is evaluated based on the availability of relevant skills and facilities, the likelihood of cost and technical success, and other administrative considerations. Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost. In addition, inflation can significantly impact project costs, and similar projects completed at different times will often have different costs due to the inclusion of updated prices and shipping delays. Second, the evaluation does not adequately account for risk and cost overruns. As a result, the proposal evaluation does not fully represent the true cost of building a telescope, which can be particularly relevant in the case of international projects, where local political or economic factors can lead to",

We expect that the astronomical community will adopt this modern and more appropriate method for later construction projects , and that traditional telescopes will be enlarged to address the growing demands of the astronomical community .

Although there are some improvements to the assessment method in the Proposal Revision 1 . 0 document , there are some details of the proposal assessment that should be reconsidered to help address the actual requirements of different projects and account for danger . First , the cost assessment does not fully include the cost of projects , as it does not include inflation adjustments , enable for useful contingency periods , or reflect changes in the buy value of capital units over cost . These mistakes can lead to an overall overestimation of expense , as projects often require extra effort to perform system or facility construction reviews , detailed construction drawings , or other operations that drive up the cost . In addition , inflation can significantly increase project costs , and similar projects completed at different periods will also have different costs due to the inclusion of updated values and ship delays . Second , the assessment does not fully account for cost and cost overruns . As a result , the proposal assessment does not fully address the true cost of construction a telescope , which can be especially relevant in the instance of international projects , where regional historical or economic circumstances can lead to",
        "rewrite_text": "The astronomic community frequently engages in discussions regarding proposals for novel telescopes, and this pattern has persisted for over a decade without the funding of a modern, large optical telescope. The absence of modern resources is attributed to a flawed approach in proposal evaluation that fails to clearly articulate the cost of new construction projects, inadequately considers the risk of cost escalation, and ultimately neglects the needs of the astronomical community.\n\nWe advocate for a different method that more accurately reflects project expenses and places greater emphasis on the benefits of modern projects. This includes opportunities for international collaboration and enhanced technical capabilities. We anticipate that the astronomical community will adopt this updated and more suitable method for future construction projects, and that existing telescopes will be upgraded to meet the growing demands of the community.\n\nSince 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals encompass a diverse range of costs and technical requirements. The Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has analyzed each proposal using an assessment methodology that has remained largely unchanged since 2005. This methodology encompasses several key areas for review, including cost, technical development, and management.\n\nThe cost component is divided into two primary areas: 1) the initial capital expenditure for the facility, and 2) ongoing operational costs, which include operations and maintenance, repair expenses, and operational expenses. The technical assessment focuses on the concept and expertise of the telescope, evaluating its performance in achieving scientific objectives. The management assessment considers factors such as board and committee structures, and compliance with the Operating Periodic Table (OPT) regulations.\n\nThe EBT has established assessment templates for each of these areas, with each proposal thoroughly analyzed based on the availability of relevant skills and resources, the likelihood of cost and technical performance, and other administrative requirements. While there have been some improvements to the assessment method outlined in Proposal Revision 1.0, there are still aspects of proposal evaluation that require reconsideration to better address actual project needs and mitigate risks.\n\nFirstly, the cost assessment does not fully account for project costs, as it fails to incorporate inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchasing power of capital units over time. These oversights can lead to an overall inflation in estimated expenses as projects often require additional efforts for system or facility construction reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other operations that drive up costs. Additionally, inflation can significantly increase project costs, and similar projects completed at different time periods may have varying costs due to updated values and shipment delays.\n\nSecondly, the evaluation does not adequately consider cost and cost overruns. Consequently, the proposal assessment process does not fully reflect the true cost of constructing a telescope, which can be particularly significant in international projects where regional historical or economic circumstances can influence costs.",

However, there are numerous common scenarios where isotopic or other charge symmetries spontaneously break, leading to a structural reduction (DR) where local coordination assumes a reduced state, resulting in less constrained local interactions.\n\nVarious classes of these scenarios arise from expanding relativity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as scenarios such as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special Relativity (dS/PSR). All of these share a common feature: the existence of a background field, specifically a gauge field, whose field intensity is non-zero. This leads to a local field explicitly transforming into a global property. However, the effects of symmetry breaking are independent of local symmetry transformation parameters, making the symmetry transformation variable a Goldstone boson.\n\nThis can be used to deduce universal features of DR schemes, independent of the specific details of the symmetry-broken system. For instance, it is anticipated that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will result in a reduced local symmetry, with the local crystal transformation variable equivalent to a Goldstone boson. In particular, for the minimal de Sitter and Projective Special Relativity scenarios, there is a precise correlation between the regional de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, leading to an exact Goldstone boson equivalence. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the spontaneous breaking of isotopic or other charge symmetries is expected to lead to the universality class of Conformal, CPT, and Extension Conformal symmetries. These results imply universal features of DR schemes that are independent of the specific details of the symmetry-broken system.",

These dynamical families are named after the major asteroidal orbits into which they are reminiscent: These include (primary) Apollo, (secondary) Hellenic, (tertiary) Aten, (tertiary) Melita, (tertiary) Cassini and (tertiary) Reichhardt, and (secondary) Ake nsen , Hestia and Opera. We also provide the largest size range classification of the Trojans to date, including 15 families (with 134 members) discovered via their proper orbital elements, and 33 families (with 442 members) discovered via their physical characteristics. Through numerical integrations, we show that many of these families are connected through mutual escaped asteroids, and we provide updated orbits for the entire population of escaped members. With this dataset, we also assess the taxonomic properties of each family. We further classify 27 families as S-types and 56 as C-types. S-types are consistent with the high albedo populations described in previous studies and likely include the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 families named after the major asteroid belt S-type asteroid groups. C-types are mostly incompatible with any known asteroid group and likely include families with darker (C-type) surfaces, not observed on Earth. Based on our data and previous studies, we identify two overlapping populations of Trojans: the S-type and the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 family members. The combined population of these two groups (83 members) is very dynamically similar to the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 families, and this may be evidence of a large, previously unidentified family that connects the two groups.

Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe. We provide an example of how the existence of this weakly interacting massive particle dark matter could be established or disproved by measuring the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our galaxy.",

With the help of the Babel code, an estimate of the gyrochronological age was obtained.\n\nThe surface age was calculated to compare with the true age, aiming to determine the feasibility of gyrochronology for estimating the ages of G-type stars. The effectiveness of the method was assessed using a two-sample t-test, the number of regular stars, the Scholz circle coefficient, and a gyrochronology-chromchronology plot. The results indicate that gyrochronology is a feasible method for determining the ages of G-type components, with a total error of -2.2% suggesting that for most stars, the gyrochronological age is within 10% of the true age.\n\nHowever, challenges remain in the method due to T_c's dependence on star composition, which leads to a mix-up between aging and metallicity. The gyrochronology-chromchronology plot illustrates these difficulties by showing T_Ce versus surface aging with metallicity plotted as a different symbol.",

We provide a simple and unified approach to the classical KYP inequality, including results for discrete-time LTI systems, discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) systems, and continuous-time LTV systems. We also extend the KYP inequality to the case of partial measurements. Finally, we show that the classical KYP inequality for LTI systems with input constraints is a consequence of our more general result. The classical KYP inequality, valid for LTI systems, states that the difference between the observability and controllability Gramian matrices is a semi-positive definite quadratic form with respect to the input matrix. This result has been extended to LTI systems with input constraints (i.e., with zero inputs) by various authors. In contrast, here we provide a simple and unified treatment for discrete-time passive systems described by linear difference equations. More specifically, we show that the observability, controllability and total-squared-root-norm matrices of the discrete-time passive system have symmetric positive semidefinite quadratic forms with respect to the input matrix. As a consequence, we obtain a general version of the KYP inequality for discrete-time passive systems. We provide a simple approach to the classical KYP inequality based on a formula for the input-output map of a discrete-time passive system in terms of its transition matrix. In this way we obtain a new proof of this result for discrete-time LTI systems, discrete-time LTV systems and continuous-time LTV systems. As an example, we also prove the classical KYP inequality for LTI systems with input constraints.

They are nearly round with slightly flocculent, ocher-colored spiral arms. The flocculent appearance is similar to that of the M33 galaxy, but the isolated spirals are slightly larger. Elliptical isophotes are rare. The distance estimates range from 9 to 17 Mpc, with an average of 13 Mpc. The apparent V band magnitudes range from 15.9 to 16.4 with an average of 16.0. The absolute V band magnitude Mv ranges from -18.4 to -17.0 with an average of -16.5. The colors are fairly blue, with V-R equal to 0.6 and R-I equal to 0.7. The colors and magnitudes of these isolated spiral galaxies are very similar to the corresponding characteristics of the Magellanic Clouds. Thus these galaxies are probably satellites of the Milky Way. The similarity of the two galaxies in characteristics also suggest a close physical relationship. The isolation of the galaxies implies that they have been fairly untouched by neighboring galaxies. Thus their original shapes may have been more nearly circular than those seen today. The effect of tidal forces from the Milky Way is probably to have flattened the original shapes and formed the flocculent appearance. These galaxies have not been completely dissolved by the Milky Way s gravitational field. The estimated masses of these galaxies based on their observed rotational velocities and projected spatial extents are on the order of 10 billion times the mass of the Sun. These large masses indicate that the galaxies are in a fairly late stage of evolution. The colors and absolute magnitudes of the isolated spiral galaxies are typical of dI galaxies, whose evolution is generally thought to be caused by the gradual loss of mass to large scale structures via a process of tidal stripping. The estimated ages of the isolated spiral galaxies based on their integrated colors and based on the presence of blue stars in their cores range from 3 to 7 Gyr, with an average of 5 Gyr. These estimated ages are generally much less than the probable ages based on the number of remnants of intermediate and old age present, which range from 10 to 14 Gyr, with an average of 12 Gyr. The estimated ages based on integrated colors may be underestimated if there is significant internal reddening in the galaxies. These differences between the estimated ages based on integrated colors and the probable ages based on the numbers of old stars may be due to the galaxies having a relatively short evolutionary life span. Some of the galaxies may be new systems in the process of formation. The infraredASAS survey found no evidence of an active nucleus in any of the isolated spiral galaxies. The nucleus of an isolated spiral galaxy may be completely extinguished by the surrounding dust. Thus, judging from the integrated optical characteristics and the infrared spectra, it seems that",

They possess narrowly circular shapes and possess slightly flocculent, ocher-colored spiral arms. These flocculent features are comparable to the M33 spiral's appearance, yet the small spirals are slightly larger in size. Elliptical isophotes are not frequently observed in these galaxies. Distance estimates range from 9 to 17 million parsecs, with an average of 13 million parsecs. The visual V-band spectrum magnitudes vary between 15.9 and 16.4, averaging out to 16.0. As for the actual V-band magnitude Mv, it ranges from -18.4 to -17.0, averaging at -16.5. The colors of these galaxies are predominantly typical, with V-R and R-I values equal to 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. Their color and magnitude values closely mirror those of the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that these galaxies may be satellites of the Milky Way.\n\nThe similarity in features between the two galaxies further indicates a close physical correlation. The absence of any evident disturbances from surrounding galaxies suggests that these galaxies have been relatively undisturbed. Therefore, their initial shapes could have been more circular than what is currently observed. It is likely that the effects of tidal pressures from the Milky Way have distorted their original forms, resulting in the flocculent features we observe today. These galaxies have not been fully absorbed into the Milky Way's cosmic field.\n\nBased on their predicted rotational velocities and projected spatial extents, the expected values for these galaxies are on average 10 billion times the weight of the Sun. These high values suggest that they are in a later stage of evolution. The colors and actual magnitudes of these small spiral galaxies are typical of dI galaxies, which are believed to evolve through gradual weight loss to larger structures via a process known as tidal stripping.\n\nThe expected ages of these small spiral galaxies, determined by their integrated colors as well as the presence of blue hues in their cores, range from 3 to 7 billion years old, with an average of 5 billion years. However, these expected ages are often less than the proposed ages based on the number of remnants found at intermediate and ancient ages, which range from 10 to 14 billion years old with an average of 12 billion years. If there is significant internal reddening within the galaxies, the estimated ages based on integrated colors may be underestimated. The disparities between the expected ages derived from integrated colors and those predicted based on population aging could be attributed to the galaxies having a relatively short evolutionary lifespan.\n\nSome of these galaxies may be distinct systems within the overall system of formation. The infrared ASAS survey has revealed no data indicating an active nucleus in any of these small spiral galaxies, suggesting that the nuclei of distant spiral galaxies could be completely obscured by surrounding matter.

I explain a method for acquiring these parameters from extensive depth imaging spectra, utilizing cutting-edge molecular tracks and the intensities of various atomic and molecular systems. To demonstrate its effectiveness, I present an application to the open cluster IC 4651 and field members of a similar stellar type. The necessary observational data, including extensive astronomical spectra and relevant observing parameters, are provided, sourced from books and my own observations at the Haute-Provence Observatory.\n\nThe primary challenge with this method is the dependency on large-scale imaging spectra, which may not always be feasible for analyzing vast amounts of stellar data. Nevertheless, this methodology has a wide range of applications and I illustrate its initial use in large regions and field systems. This can aid us in understanding the characteristics of these communities. Specifically, the results indicate that intermediate-depth spectrographs from large telescopes (such as MuSiC and Probeca) offer significant data returns while minimizing costs, making them ideal candidates for surveying vast regions of stars.",

Our findings indicate that joint applicability has blossomed over the centuries, with spikes occurring in the late decade and early 2000s. This may suggest a rapid development of the semiconductor industry and the convergence of wireless technology. Furthermore, we observe clear geographical patterns in joint applicability, where higher joint applicability is observed in regions with strong usage of similar systems, such as the Kanto region in Japan and California in the United States. These geographical disparities could be attributed to differences in regulations, sales, and consumer preferences.",

In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of these EOS singularities, focusing on the specific case of finite-time singularities. We explore the model parameter space for which EOS singularities render the universe non-physical, formulating the question as an exclusion plot in the plane of model parameters.

It is suspected that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as evidenced by its spectral class of Z-source, which is characterized by having strong, sometimes regular, neutron star high-speed winds. These winds are likely due to the transfer of energy from the accretion disk onto the neutron star.

The major result of this work is the discovery of acutoff powerlaw component in the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, with a flux contribution of approximately 50% over nearly 3 decades in energy. This component is not commonly observed in X-ray binaries, and therefore its discovery with INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high energy production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the accretion disk blackbody component which is often seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and is generally thought to be the signature ofNETWORK GAMMA RAYS radiated by the inner part of an accretion disk around a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a neutron star at its core, represents a new paradigm for high energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, and may indicate that disk accretion is not the only form of high energy production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is the result of a new form of high energy production unique to this system, which may be a result of the strong neutron star winds. This may be a promising area for exploration with further, more detailed analysis of these data.",

        "rewrite_text": "The description of the significant emission observed from GRO J1655-40 during the 2005 outburst, as determined by INTEGRAL spectroscopy, is provided. This binary system, commonly known as a quiet hole X-field, comprises a neutron star orbiting a hot, 18-meter-wide object in a close orbit (spanning 13-31 R_s) every 2.87 hours. It is suspected that events involving the accretion of disk material onto the dwarf star in this system are indicated by its Z-source classification, which is characterized by powerful, occasionally regular, miniature sources with high-speed winds. These winds may be attributed to the transfer of information from the accretion disk onto the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was first detected by the INTEGRAL telescope on January 28th, 2005, and reached its peak on February 24th. The present research focuses on the extensive intensity spectrum of GRO J1655-40 during this period.\n\nThe most significant finding from this effort is the discovery of a cutoff powerlaw component in the intense spectrum of GRO J1655-40. This component accounts for approximately 50% of the density over nearly three centuries in energy. This feature is not typically observed in X-disk binaries; therefore, its detection by INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high-intensity production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the blackbody component of the accretion disk, which is commonly seen in black hole X-field binaries. It is generally believed to be the result of network gamma rays generated by the inner portion of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a small star at its core, represents a new model for sustained activity production in hot hole X-ray binaries and suggests that disk accretion may not be the sole mechanism for high-intensity production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is a unique manifestation of a different type of high-intensity production specific to this system, which could be attributed to the strong stellar wind decay.

We explore scenarios where the source has complete knowledge of message state information (CSI) and where the receiver only possesses statistical CSI.\n\nIn the scenario where perfect CSI is available at the source, we determine the optimal number of active transmitters and accompanying transmission speed that maximize the number of receivers who can recover information at an arbitrarily low cost.

Straggler identification is an important problem in the design and analysis of distributed systems, and has received much attention in the literature.

More recently, variants of Bloom filters have been used for straggler identification, enabling data stream applications with affordable memory and fast detection.

We overcome this limitation by harnessing the power of Newton s identities, a set of three deterministic matrix equations that are invertible. Unlike Bloom filters, our solution can accurately identify stragglers. We describe an algorithm that, using just two timestamps per stream element, can identify straggler processes with high probability, and in particular can accurately identify stragglers to within a set of n processes, for any specified n.

These fibrations generalize the notion of fibrations, fiber bundles with possibly non-empty boundary, and allow for fibers that are manifolds with boundary. We study these objects via a filtration of the mapping stack. We show that exploded fibrations with fiber a surface are smooth orbifolds with boundary, and exhibit a factorization of the map to the classifying stack as the union of a smooth map with a smooth map onto the classifying stack of a certain gerbe. We give two examples of exploded fibrations: the map to the mapping stack of a Riemann surface with two boundary components, and the classifying map of a surface bundle over a surface. We also discuss the homotopy theory of exploded fibrations. We define an *exploded fibration* to be a homotopy fiber of a map from a topological fibration. We show that the homotopy type of an exploded fibration can be classified by a simplicial set with a nice set of degenerations. We introduce the notions of an *exploded weak equivalence* and an *exploded fibration*, and give two examples of these classes of maps: the exploded mapping space is weakly equivalent to the mapping space of a topological fibration, and the homotopy fiber of a map of exploded fibrations is exploded fibrations. We show that the homotopy type of an exploded space can be built from its hohstairs by a sequence of functors modeling fibrations, exploded fibrations, and weak equivalence. We conjecture a description of the hohsofatizations of these model category structures on the level of homotopy categories. We expect these hohsofatizations to be algebraic models for proper Maps, genuine Maps, and weak Maps between exploded spaces. Our main example of an exploded space is the classifying space of an exploded group. We show that this is weakly equivalent to the mapping stack of the unit interval with a based point, and that its underlying space is homotopy equivalent to the infinite permutation space of a pointed topological space. Finally, we discuss the parallel transport of vectors on exploded fibrations. We define a *smooth vector*, or instanton, to be a quadruple consisting of a vector on the total space, a path through the structure group, and two tangent vectors on the fiber over the base, such that the tangent vector on the base is the given vector and the parallel transport of the tangent vector in the fiber along the path is the vector itself.

The analysis of these data provides us with the first view of the central 10pc of this system and reveals the nature of its luminous infrared nuclear starburst (even in the presence of an active galactic nucleus,AGN) and its possible link with similar galaxies and their nuclear activity. The bright infrared nuclear starburst in NGC4418, shining as a dominant contributor of infrared luminosity in the Antennae system, has been known for many years (Braine et al. 1993, Downes & Solomon 1998). The origin of this starburst and its relation to the buried AGN was a long-standing mystery. New ALMA data of the luminous far-infrared molecular hydrogenCN (HC3N) v=0-1 infrared line emission has now provided us with a clear view of the dynamics and energy source in the central 10pc of this system. We detect high velocity outflowing motions in this region, of up to 400 km/s. This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017). Our data is in perfect agreement with the recent findings of Fu et al. (2019), who detect a radio-loud Seyfert-1 nucleus with star formation in NGC4418. This suggests that the growth of supermassive black holes and their activity are intimately connected with the growth of host galaxies and the onset of nuclear starbursts, just like in the case of the Milky Way. In summary, our ALMA data of the nuclear starburst in the Antennae galaxies has provided us with a clear view of its nature and dynamics.

This overdensity is at least partially corroborated by weak optical emission from dust, as measured by the *Spitzer Space Telescope, and is consistent with infrared spectroscopic surveys showing a high number density of young, hot, and massive stars. The most massive stars, with a likely initial mass of several hundred solar masses, have an implied present formation mass of several thousand solar masses if they have starved-looking disks and are considered to be in the main sequence phase. The derived mass and size are also consistent with stellar-mass-threshold predictions for formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), an expected signature of active supermassive black hole growth at the center of the cluster. The age and masses of the stellar populations are also consistent with IMBH formation via seeds from the remnants of very massive stars, although higher chance of coalescence for lower mass seeds cannot be ruled out. A peculiar velocity of the cluster with respect to the local standard of rest, measured from the motion of bright member stars, and the mass projected along the line-of-sight, both suggest the cluster may not be virialized. If a supermassive black hole is present, as suggested by its likely formation via intermediate-mass black hole seeds or very massive star remnants, the observed properties of the cluster systematically depart from those expected for a classical star cluster. This intriguing object suggests that either massive seeds for IMBHs could have formed outside of clusters, and grown via accretion, or there is more than one mode of IMBH formation. Future optical spectroscopy of cluster members, in combination with infrared studies of the dust emission and a search for an IMBH, will help determine the most likely formation channel for this enigmatic object.",

In this work, we investigate the possibility that the dust in the middle ring is dynamically linked to the binary system, as suggested by White et al. (2004).

We find that the dust and gas kinematics are consistent with each other within the errors, suggesting that the dust and gas in the ring are dynamically coupled. Based on the Toomre parameter and gravitational stability criteria, the observed ring radius and temperature are consistent with a population of planetesimals whose ephemeris is maintained by an external perturber. We investigate whether the outer ring is externally disturbed by calculating the mutual gravitational interaction between the two rings and find that the observed offset between the dust peaks is insufficient to maintain the observed ring structure.

In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure. The properties of haloes in clusters are largely set by their major mergers since z &gt; 2, leaving them with short orbital times and low orbital kinetic energy. Conversely, the evolution of void haloes is more complex, with a mixture of processes at work.

In this paper, we utilize the large-volume (exceeding 8.5 billion g^-1 Mpc^3) and intermediate-height (molecular weight < 8.5 x 10^9 g^-1 M⊙) Millennium-II model to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of density, magnetic, and electron kinetic values of dark matter haloes across four environments: fields, sectors, filaments, and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions, and mergers on these properties.\n\nThe volume dependence of these ranges significantly evolves with time, and climate plays a considerable role in the distribution at fixed points in time. Generally, haloes in layers and filaments exhibit more organized bulk ranges compared to their clustered or filled counterparts across all epochs. These differences are reflected in their respective weight components, with filament regions being the largest and most dynamically evolving structures, while voids are the most overdense regions and thus mark the sites of latest and later system development. The progression of these ranges with time and climate is attributed to the hierarchical growth of systems.\n\nFurthermore, there are considerable differences in spin and spacecraft kinetic electricity across environments. The magnetic balance exhibits a close-universal behavior, unaffected by context or redshift, while the internal kinetic electricity demonstrates various behaviors, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This results in the hierarchical formation of structures in layers and filaments, which occurs relatively late, leading to the deposition of matter in inner regions and a reduction in substructure. The structures of halo groups are primarily determined by their largest mergers since z > 2, leaving them with short kinetic days and low orbital kinetic values. In contrast, the progression of void haloes is more complex, involving a mix of mechanisms. Subhaloes can only survive in the highest density regions for a limited time, while the expansion of cosmic matter leads to reduced concentrations and lower kinetic energies. However, voids also result from interactions later than sheets, with fewer main mergers and more minor interactions. This has significant implications for understanding the evolution of cosmic structures and their interactions with the surrounding environment.",

In this work we combine all of the archival Spitzer observations of NGC 6052 in order to carry out a detailed analysis of the galaxy s spectral energy distribution (SED).

The resulting best-fit model parameters indicate that NGC 6052 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with an estimated power of 1051 W and a distance of 95.2 billion light years.

Consequently, the interference fringes facilitate an accurate determination of the Aharonov-Bohm cycle arising from the spatial overlap of the two distinct electron wave systems. These experiments of two-molecule interference in helium, a seemingly simple system with complex multi-system interactions, illustrate the potency of this interference concept in characterizing quantum multi-world systems and hold great potential for applications in quantum systems and modeling.",

We apply this method to characterize the suppression of cosmic ray flux above the so-called GZK energy and compare the results with previous measurements using traditional parameterizations. We also study the sensitivity to changes in the content of primary cosmic rays and in the chemical composition by using a new parameter, the spectral rigidity, which is a measure of the energy separation between adjacent energy levels of a given atom or nucleus.

In this project, we present a sophisticated modern assessment technique based on the distribution of lengths between consecutive surface experimental components. This technique provides measurements of parameters that are more sensitive to the presence and intensity of the primary element than the traditional lateral distribution systems. We employ this method to characterize the suppression of cosmic background flow above the GZK value, integrating the results with previous observations utilizing traditional parameterizations.\n\nFurthermore, we explore the response to alterations in the composition of primary cosmic beams and molecular chemistry by employing a distinct variable: spectral rigidity. This metric quantifies the distance between adjacent charge concentrations of a specified atom or molecule. We demonstrate that the calculated chemistry-dependent parameters above the GZK cutoff align with our understanding of this feature as a result of the interaction between high-intensity cosmic beams and the photon background. This supports the notion that the interaction is predominantly composed of atomic <C> and <Si> interactions.",

There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy. The results of long-term observations of the dust content in a number of galaxies, made using the 100-m and the 45-m radio telescopes of the MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and the 0.7-meter telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the APEX Telescope, the IRAM 30-m and the SEST 20-m radio telescopes in Chile, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, and other facilities have shown that the production and evolution of dust in a galaxy is associated with certain properties of this galaxy. It was established that in late-type spiral galaxies the intensity of radiation in radio wavelengths increases with time, which indicates the gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium, due to the merger of large bodies. In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies. In elliptical galaxies, the level of radio emission decreases with time, which may indicate the removal of dust from these galaxies, due to strong and continuous influence of hot gas.",

We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution. Thus, the fluctuation of the scalar field determining the number density of dark matter contributes to the gravitational waves with the parameter Omega_GW, which is related to the speed of the gravity. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. In addition, we study the perturbation of the gravitational wave during the sub-Hubble scales. We find that the perturbation of the gravitational wave is dependent on the effective speed of gravity during inflation. If the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then the amplitude of the perturbation of the gravitational wave is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed of gravity. This result has an upper limit, which is 1/3 for the case of two-field models and 1/7 for the case of multi-field models. Finally, we discuss the gravitational wave background from the inflationary universe. If the effective speed of gravity is larger than the light speed, there are many modes with the scale of the Hubble radius at the time of inflation, which lead to a large gravitational wave background. In this case, it is difficult to explain the recent gravitational wave experiments such as B-mode experiment and LIGO/Virgo. However, if the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then we obtain the consistent gravitational wave background with the current value.

This is linked to the speed of the field during the inflationary cycle.

We establish that the maximum number of gravitational signals in this scenario is equivalent to the value in general relativity, with Omega_GW equal to 1. This result remains unchanged even when the scalar field has an upper limit.\n\nFurthermore, we explore the scenario with two scalar fields: the complex inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The curvaton field produces fluctuations in the number density of dark matter, while the inflaton field reflects changes in the expansion rate of the universe. During inflaton oscillation, the weight speed is nearly normal, but it is slower during the lifespan of the complex inflaton field. Consequently, fluctuations in the scalar field contributing to the number density of dark matter affect field signals with a variable Omega_GW, which is tied to the speed of gravity. We confirm that the maximum number of gravitational signals remains consistent with the general relativity value of Omega_GW being 1.\n\nAdditionally, we investigate the perturbations in gravitational waves during sub-Hubble periods. We find that these perturbations depend on the effective speed of gravity during inflation. If the effective speed is equivalent to a short speed, the amplitude of the traveling wave's perturbation is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed. This result has an upper limit, specifically 1/3 for two-field models and 1/7 for multi-field models.\n\nFinally, we discuss the gravitational wave background arising from the inflationary universe. When the effective speed of relativity exceeds the normal speed, numerous modes emerge with a limit set by the Hubble radius at the speed of inflation, leading to a significant gravitational wave background. This makes it challenging to explain recent cosmic wave experiments like B-type models and LIGO/Virgo. However, if the effective speed of relativity is equal to the speed of light, we obtain a consistent gravitational wave background that aligns with current values.\n\nTo achieve a model with a maximum contribution to gravitational signals, we can utilize a scalar field with a reduced bound, which results in a maximum effective speed of gravity during inflation. In this scenario, it becomes easier to explain the actual value of the gravitational wave background while still accounting for fluctuations in the field.",

This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem.

First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic.

They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces. We conclude that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may have an important impact on astrophysical jets, which makes it an important area for future study. The resonant coupling discussed here could also be important in microquasars, the envirnment of black hole systems like SS 433, where a pair of stars orbiting each other eject high-energy jets. The stars are in nearly circular orbits, but the jets are highly relativistic and tend to ejection in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. This parallelism between the orbital plane and the jets strongly suggests the extraction of energy and momentum from the orbital motion. The extraction of energy and momentum from a shearing relativistic flow may provide a new mechanism for this parallelism. Resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetos",

These winds play a pivotal role in facilitating the transfer of significant information and momentum across galaxies and their groups. Although the exact mechanisms behind the formation of astrophysical jets remain elusive, numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain them. In particular, it has been suggested that magnetic fields play a crucial role in generating, collimating, and maintaining these astrophysical jets.\n\nIn this study, we delve into the resonating interaction between the rapid Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave within a sheared, relativistic field. Our focus lies on exploring the astrophysical systems where such interactions may occur. Our investigation is conducted within the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems, the resonant interaction can effectively transfer information from the waves into the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity, we consider a system comprising a sheared field moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a pseudo-neutral field influenced by an external magnetic field B0 along the y-axis. We examine the modes that arise when the continuous propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave aligns with the speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave.\n\nThe most volatile spectrum exhibits a short wavelength in the y-plane and non-zero wave speeds in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most susceptible system is proportional to the square of the flow vorticity on the y-side, indicating that the system is most effective in differentially rotating environments. However, the degree of volatility also depends on the ratio of stress to sound speed, γShc, which varies with γShc. Higher shear values enhance the effectiveness of the method. Additionally, we explore the stability of this weakest zone against non-continuous interactions.\n\nWhen the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, both currents react nonlinearly, and the most volatile wave evolves into a solid shock wave with smooth contact areas. Our findings suggest that the resonant interaction between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic currents holds significant implications for astrophysical dynamics, making it a focal point for future research. Furthermore, the discussed resonant interactions could be relevant in microquasars, such as the environment of SS 433 black hole systems where stars engage in close circular orbits but emit highly relativistic jets in an opposite direction to the internal plane. This alignment between orbital plane and jet strongly supports the transfer of information and momentum from spacecraft motion. The extraction of energy and force from a shearing relativistic flow may offer an alternative approach to this parallelism. The amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves through resonance holds tremendous potential for further exploration in astrophysical contexts.",

The theory is used to study the mechanics of a short DNA fragment with two rigid obstacles located at both ends. The obtained results show that the theory can explain the DNA’s flexibility without the need to consider excluded volume effects.

        "rewrite_text": "The concept of the worm-like chain (WLC) has become the standard model for studying the bending stiffness of biopolymers such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. This model assumes that biopolymers are composed of a homogeneous system of rigid interactions linked by anti-simple rigid bonds. However, despite its widespread usage, the WLC model fails to account for the inherent heterogeneity of the chain and bonds that may be susceptible to partial rupture.\n\nTo address this deficiency, numerous modifications to the original WLC model have been suggested. In this paper, we introduce an alternative concept based on the worm-like complex with breakable bonds (WLCBB). This proposed chain allows for numerous degrees of bending freedom and an additional continuous stiffness arising from the melting and reformation of bonds.\n\nTo precisely solve the problem, we map it to a standard junction problem in a plane. This concept is employed to explore the mechanics of a short DNA sample with two rigid obstacles positioned at both ends. The gathered results demonstrate that this concept can explain the flexibility of DNA without the need to consider volume reduction effects. Furthermore, it predicts that as the length of the DNA sample decreases, its flexibility will increase up to a certain level, and then decline after that point. This proposal is an enhanced and expanded version of the previous one.",

Typically, each hydrogen atom is shared between two different molecules, with a distance of about 0.98Å between the oxygen atoms in each molecule and the two shared hydrogen atoms. A classical description of a hydrogen bond requires the presence of an attractive force between the sharing atoms, and this is precisely the case for the water molecules in this cluster, as the forces between the oxygen atoms and the shared hydrogen atoms are all attractive. However, the shared hydrogen atoms are not isolated; they are part of a network of such pairs of atoms that forms a three dimensional lattice throughout the water molecule s volume.

The amount of the weakening depends on the particular orientation of the water molecules in the cluster, but if the lattice is assumed to extend uniformly throughout the cluster, the force between the shared hydrogen atoms is found to be one-third of the force between the oxygen atoms in the water molecules.

One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contribution of the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino to this magnetic moment. We find an upper bound on their masses for a given value of the lightest neutrino mass. This model can be considered as an example of an unbalanced See-Saw mechanism, where the violation of the conservation of one or several of the additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very massive particles. This model has some other interesting phenomenological implications, in particular the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this model leads to the observed enhancement of the Higgs decay to a pair of muons, presented at the Moriond EW session as an excess. Massive and massless neutrinos were hypothesized in the 60s in order to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

One such model is based on the 'seeing-saw' system, utilizing interactions at the Grand Unification level (GUT) to assign minor masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an enhanced version of this system by introducing various additional symmetries, resulting in the construction of the inverse seesaw system.\n\nContrary to previous models based on the seeing-saw system, in this modern class of models, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can possess a significantly large weight, particularly surpassing the TeV level. This presupposes the existence of a distinct GeV-TeV collider system for this particular neutrino, making it testable in the near future. We demonstrate practical solutions for this class of models with both regular and altered neutrino weight structures.\n\nThe deviation from unitarity in the first element of the PMNS matrix is utilized to explain the normal level, while a deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix accounts for the opposite rank. This model can be verified through the measurement of the anomalous magnetic force of the muon. We illustrate the one-loop interaction between the lightest excited neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino with this magnetic field, providing an upper limit on their weight for a specific value of the lightest neutrino weight.\n\nThis model can be seen as an exemplar of an unbalanced See-Saw system where the conservation of one or several extra symmetries leads to the presence of either massless or very large states. This model has various other intriguing phenomenological implications, particularly regarding the possibility of keV sterile neutrinos. Our model offers an explanation for the observed enhancement in Higgs decay into a pair of muons, which was described at the Moriond EW session as an excess.\n\nMassive and massless neutrinos were initially proposed in the 1960s to explain solar and ambient neutrino oscillations. The experimental confirmation of these oscillations has revolutionized our understanding of matter science and cosmology. The standard framework to explain these oscillations involves the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for the Dirac concept of the neutrino, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) photon concept, and the Fermi electron concept. These three interactions constitute the standard model (SM) neutrinos with zero weight. However, oscillation experiments have shown that at least two of these neutrinos possess non-zero masses. On the other hand, cosmological observations of the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) suggest that at least two of these neutrinos should be relatively light. These observations are collectively referred to as the 'floppy masses' issues, and numerous models have been proposed in recent decades to address them.",

We compare charged and neutral molecular spectra, elliptic flow, and high transverse charge matter production across a range of 15% centrality, spanning from the most central to the most peripheral Au+Au collisions.\n\nOur conclusions indicate that the matter production at forward rapidity is accurately described by a quadratic distribution of the number of N-molecules per system of rapidity, where N represents both charged and neutral particles. We compare these results with hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), calculations from lattice QCD, and models based on weakly coupled fields. Our data provide the most detailed and stringent requirements for these models, highlighting the importance of various aspects of collision dynamics to different components of the experimental particle spectra. We quantify these components using a thermal-dependent model, enabling us to obtain the thermal parameters for the system at both thermal and kinetic freezeouts.\n\nThese parameters are contrasted with predictions from optimal hadron gas and flow models at both constituent quark and hadronic levels. We find that the kinetic freezeout coefficient is more strongly constrained by the data, with a narrow range of values between 155 MeV < T < 175 MeV obtained. Preliminary results suggest that the hadron gas cycle is short-lived, with a strong transition to a heavier and hadronically depleted intermediate state at molecular freezeout. While both hard absorption and the initial phases of the atomic collision seem to be consistent with a perturbative nature, the strongly coupled final system is well described by a gluon field with mild centrality-dependent heats within the range of 155 MeV < T < 175 MeV.",

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision.

In this research, we demonstrate that this interaction process also alters the elemental chemistry of the gas. Our model is related to the gas observed in the current Universe, indicating that while the X-element enhancement is significantly reduced compared to large-redshift systems, it still provides a reliable prediction for the overall trend. Furthermore, we show that the behavior of this enhancement strongly depends on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low intensities.\n\nApplying our model to a wider range of spectra, we find that different spectra lead to X-element enhancements at levels ranging from 10^-3 to 1 solar values at z=0 for various metallicities at 10^-4 solar values. This diversity of possible enhancements underscores the significance of experimental research into the early development of the Universe. Our model highlights the impact of interactions between cosmic beams and the primordial gas on both the gas cycle and elemental abundances. This has crucial implications for the potential of the gas to form structures and the progression of heavy element density over time.\n\nAlthough the overall trend of X-element enhancement in our model is smaller than in high-redshift systems, it is still sufficient to predict the overall trend when compared to gas observed in the early Universe. We also demonstrate that the behavior of the enhancement is strongly influenced by the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low intensities. Our project emphasizes the importance of experimental research into the early stages of the Universe's development and the need for a deeper understanding of mechanisms occurring at low energies, such as the interaction between cosmic beams and gas in the ancient world.\n\nWe propose a formal method for modeling the evolution of molecular abundances, including elemental occurrence enhancement, starting from specified ionisation and chemical networks and a defined spectrum of cosmic beams. The results of our calculations are consistent and can be directly integrated into ionisation and chemical networks. Different networks must be defined in terms of the twelve essential reactions required to produce the twelve molecules containing a significant proportion of augmented groups and a complete system for twelve additional groups.\n\nThe modified molecular content can significantly influence gas cooling/heating periods, planet development, and cosmic collapse, further enriching the gas. The changes described in this research are not limited to the reionization epoch but apply to any point in the gas's lifespan until it is removed from the model by another system.

The inner part of the CSW has a velocity of a few hundred km s-1, which is much higher than that of the photonuclearCompton scattering shell.

Wang Feng, Yongchao Sun, Ping Ouyang, Xiaoping Chen, Jiaxiang Song Fluidization of a Vertically Oscillated Shallow Granular Layer The motion and characteristics of particles play a central role in many important engineering and industrial processes. An especially important process is the fluidization of granular materials, which has wide applications in the mining, metallurgical, chemical and food industries1,2,3,4,5,6. Particles in a fluidized granular layer are influenced by several fundamental factors, such as the total volume fraction, the shape and size of particles, the distribution of the particles in the fluidized bed, the energy input to the fluidized granular layer, etc. All these factors affect the fluidization characteristics of the granular layer. In this work, a vertically oscillated shallow granular layer fluidizes.

These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",

        "rewrite_text": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the Higgs doublet's vacuum expectation value (vev) initiates the melting of electroweak resonances, resulting in a field for neutral Higgs bosons that has a minimum at zero. This minimum leads to a naturalness issue due to unacceptably large quadratically divergent corrections to the neutral Higgs weight-square parameters from Standard Model (SM) interactions. To resolve this issue, a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum with superpartner interactions at accessible energies is required.\n\nThe MSSM includes two additional Higgs bosons—the higgsinos and heavy scalars—which exist within supersymmetry-broken weight groups. These are the SUSY partners of the goldstino, photino, and zino. By aligning the parameters in the SUSY-broken weight matrices appropriately, these heavy scalars can be made significantly smaller than expected for the SUSY-broken level, while maintaining electroweak stability.\n\nWe conduct a phenomenological review of the expected corrections to this alignment and demonstrate that it places a limit on the weight of these scalars, with values below 1 TeV in certain regions of the MSSM factor field. In some areas of the feature plane, these values can be as low as 400 GeV. The lightest of these matter particles is a promising candidate for dark matter.\n\nFurthermore, we investigate the collider phenomenology of the model and show that this small Higgs region can be tested at modern hadron colliders, such as the CERN LHC and the Future Circular Collider, as well as the Folding@home Distributed Processing Cluster. We also explore the phenomenology of a minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with heavy scalars (MSSM-HS) at the tree level.\n\nIn this investigation, we scrutinize various particles within the broken SUSY boundary equations for the goldstino, photino, and zino's supersymmetric components. We assess the expected corrections to the alignment, allowing us to limit the values of these particles to be below 1 TeV in certain regions of the MSSM parameter space.\n\nAdditionally, we delve into the collider phenomenology of this model and affirm that this narrow Higgs region can be tested at modern hadron colliders. We focus on the following aspects: 1) We initially discuss the MSSM-HS model and its symmetry rules that superpartners must adhere to. 2) We model the spectrum of the model, particularly focusing on the Goldstino—the supersymmetric partner of the photino—and the Zino—the supersymmetric partner of the zino.",

A recently introduced variable, the partial filling factor (PFF), is used to quantify the statistical spread of these generated sequences. PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations. This corresponds to a strong spatial heterogeneity of the low-zero sequences and supports a growth mechanism of these sequences from a few deterministically produced seeds. For certain mixtures, it is found that rare event sequences happen with a non-vanishing frequency, which makes them of interest for cryptography.

We will harness these two components to derive Newton's system of universal gravitation and then illustrate how to progress to Einstein's equations of general relativity by utilizing the Riemannian solution and the pseudo-Riemannian triangle from Einstein's 1921 relativity model.\n\nFinally, we will explain how the 1977 textbook on general relativity by physicist Stephen Hawking inadvertently made a mistake that led him to conclude that the concept required the axiom of choice for its formulation. We will show that this error arose from the use of the imperfect (implicit) Euler-Lagrange formulation instead of the perfect (explicit) Lagrange formulation. By employing the perfect Lagrangian approach, it becomes evident that the axiom of selection is not a necessary prerequisite.",

This phenomenon entails a weak, random signal amplifying itself, and noise-induced signal fluctuations surpassing the signal's mean amplitude. Over the past three decades, this counterintuitive behavior has been experimentally validated and supported by theory in various nonlinear systems. Recent research has focused on information transmission via suprathreshold SR, where the signal surpasses a specific threshold level.\n\nWe delve into the optimal stimulus and noise ranges for efficient information transmission through suprathreshold stochastic resonance. Our focus is on the archetypal diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. In this context, the signal represents the spiking activity of the neuronal model, while the noise encapsulates background synaptic and neuronal activity disturbances. Contrary to previous studies, the optimal information-carrying signal is not a white noise with zero mean but rather has a non-zero mean. Furthermore, the optimal noise exhibits a vanishing variance as the sound amplitude surpasses a critical value. Remarkably, optimal information transmission performance is achieved for a wide range of transmission constants.\n\nThe derived results provide clear design requirements for maximizing the transmission capabilities of nonlinear dynamical systems through strategic signal modulation.\n\n**Materials and Methods**\n\nOur investigation into information transmission via suprathreshold SR is conducted in the context of the archetypal diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model.

In this work, we study a subset of the stable solutions, those with integral flux quanta. We find that the ratio of the toroidal field energy to the rest of the star goes as the fifth power of the field strength, so there is little free energy in the field at typical neutron star fields.

We apply this method to the galaxy cluster MACS J0429.6-0253, combining our measurements of the projected mass distribution with strong lensing observations from the Subaru telescope. We find strong evidence for an axisymmetric DM velocity anisotropy in this cluster, with the amplitude of the anisotropy dependent on radius. Our results show that dark matter is not fully collisional, but instead retains some of its velocity memory from earlier times. The methods described in this paper can be applied to other galaxy clusters, as well as other large scale structures in the Universe, allowing further tests of the nature of DM and its dynamical evolution.",

We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region. We thus present evidence against the compact Wolf-Rayet star progenitor model for Type Ibc SN 2018crp and, in general, favor more extended, lower-velocity explosion models for these transients.

Mergers between galaxies are important for galaxy evolution, because they can bring in new material, angular momentum, and, perhaps, new satellite galaxies. Observational searches for satellites have traditionally been difficult, because they are easily disrupted or removed by the galactic environment. N-body simulations have proved to be a powerful tool for predicting the frequency and properties of satellite galaxies, but predictions still require observationally-informed scaling with the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been identified in cosmological dark matter simulations, without including the baryonic physics that would likely disrupt them. In this work we use a set of zoomed-in, high-resolution cosmological simulations to examine the relation between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. We find a strong dependence of the survival of satellite galaxies on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, and on their orbital parameters. Satellite galaxies that are on highly eccentric orbits are much more likely to survive for several crossing times than those on more circular orbits. Satellites on prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those on retrograde orbits, and satellites on highly radial orbits are more likely to survive than those on low-radius orbits. Satellite galaxies that form near the center of their host are more likely to survive than those that form far from the center. We also find that the internal structures of galaxies, as measured by their phase-space structure, are a better predictor of the fate of satellites than their dark matter halos. In particular, satellites that are either on radial orbits or on highly eccentric orbits will have large amounts of stars stripped from their outer parts. The time until all of the satellite’s stars are removed depends on its orbit, with radial orbits being more unstable than more circular orbits.

Research funding is primarily official, with about 22,000 researchers (51%) working in institutions or higher education institutions supported by research councils.\n\nAmong the remaining 20,000 researchers with commercial or industrial aspirations, the majority received some industrial sponsorship, backed by UK technology sectors ranging from consultancy to applied research trials. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of UK research publications and citations, with over 200,000 publications and 20 million citations recorded in 2016, which is approximately 22% and 39% more than the volume of publications ten years prior.\n\nThe UK stands as a global leader in life sciences research, providing over 7,000 researchers to this field between 2006 and 2021. Between 2014 and 2021, these researchers are expected to account for roughly a quarter of the total UK health research expenditure. The NSFs play a crucial role in facilitating this activity, with approximately 90% of biological research conducted in UK institutions or other higher academic institutions, and 50% of science, astronomy, and data research centers.\n\nThese programs also play a significant role in advancing health research for UK industries, with approximately 40% of companies involved in health research and over half collaborating with UK institutions and other higher academic institutions.",

This is possible due to the recent development of a scheme for the determination of interfacial quantities from computer simulation of only the solute particle system. This approach is based on constructing interfaces in the simulation box that match a geometrical definition of interfacial surface, and monitoring various interfacial properties, such as average position and orientation of solute particles as a function of simulation configuration. In this way we are able to measure the interfacial tensions between two coexisting phases of tangent hard sphere chains (THC), a model system used extensively to test methods for computational interfacial studies. We find that the interfacial tensions between coexisting liquid and vapor phases and between liquid and solid phases are all positive and of similar magnitude (ca. 27 mN/m), in contrast to the typical situation in liquid-vapor and oil-water systems (ca. 40 mN/m), and hence more representative of real liquids. This is the first time that such direct measurement of interfacial tensions has been reported. A simple fundamental measure theory (FMT) approximation is shown to provide an excellent description of the interfacial tensions, and hence the FMT interface potential can be evaluated quite accurately.

This approach allows independent control of stiffness and processability of bottlebrush polymers through appropriate selection of non-covalent and covalent interactions.

Why do we care about Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces? The AdS/CFT correspondence, which was proposed by M. M. Roberts, V. A. Hubeny, C. Ranganathan, and E. funcatsbooks.com, relates a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to a conformal field theory in physical space-time. Since then, there have been many studies of quantum effects in AdS spaces, such as black holes and cosmological horizons. One reason to study the effects of quantum gravity in AdS spaces is to understand the higher-dimensional gravity itself from a view point of the lower-dimensional CFT. On the other hand, the cosmological constant in the universe is very tiny but non-zero. It has been suggested that quantum effects of the gravity could generate a positive cosmological constant. This means that the AdS space corresponds to an inflationary universe. Thus, studying quantum effects in AdS spaces provides a possible way to explain the very small but non-zero cosmological constant. However, the AdS spaces have a time-like curvature, and thus the physics in the boundary CFT does not have a time direction. This means that, since the Hawking radiation is a process from the past of the boundary, it does not affect the CFT. Thus, one cannot discuss the Cosmic No Hair conjecture from the AdS/CFT correspondence.

        "rewrite_text": "In the context of the shock-acceleration of cosmic particles, it is widely accepted that supernova remnants (SNRs) propel hadrons to high-energy levels. However, interactions and positrons tend to be constrained to lower energy levels. While hadrons and positrons are commonly described as 'secondary' particles produced through hadron-hadron interactions, observations of the galactic SNR W28 have revealed an electron-positron resonance component extending up to GeV energies. This long-range component is not accurately described by simulations focusing only on hadrons (such as pi+ and pi-) with pitch-edge diffusion within molecular cells. Our research demonstrates that incorporating a lowest-level electron-positron component (consisting of a 100 MeV source and a 10 GeV neck) into a hadron-only setup is sufficient to estimate the observed electron and positron densities, as well as the electron-to-proton balance. This observation is particularly surprising since a component of such a small effective electron-positron has not been previously associated with hadron-only scenarios in prior research. We speculate that cosmic particle beams undergo self-similar evolution, with a pseudo-connected, high-intensity component that easily emerges in shocks modified by the widespread cosmic field population.

This technique was introduced by S. Interlacements and I. Melbourne in 2010. In this paper, I explore the minor cluster of random interlacements. I demonstrate that when the rate of interlacement variation is sufficiently slow, it virtually inevitably results in an empty final subset. Conversely, when the interlacement is rapid, I prove that the final setting exhibits complete intensity. Leveraging these findings and their interactions, I establish that interlacement percolation effectively connects the system.\n\nFirstly, interlacements were introduced as a tool to estimate the path-level junction in a system with random elements. In this study, I focus on a small subset of these random interlacements. It becomes evident that, as the interlacement changes slowly, the final subset becomes devoid of elements almost inevitably. However, when the interlacement changes rapidly, the final setting shows a high concentration of elements. Utilizing these observations and their interactions, I prove that when interlacement percolates, it effectively connects the system's structure.\n\nLet Ω represent the area of all regular-valued, cadlag trails. Additionally, we define Ω~+~ as the area of càdlag trails that start at zero. For τ belonging to (0, 1), a π-random interlacement path, denoted as I(σ), exhibits various states: 1.

Despite its aesthetic and functional importance, the morphogenesis of leaf venation is a challenging problem because it involves multiple length and time scales. While it was initially hypothesized that secondary cells are only patterned after they are morphologically distinct from primary cells, it is now clear that secondary cells pattern prior to their morphological distinctness from primary cells. The signaling pathway responsible for this patterning was recently identified as a novel form of intercellular heterogeneity: elastic stresses.

In this scenario, the observable universe is viewed as a three-brane that is a domain wall living in the AdS space. In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced. This field, called the chameleon field, couples to the world volume of the brane via the Israel coupling, where the coupling strength is related to the brane tension. By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass. With explicit breaking, the scalar masses can be naturally of order one, if some conditions are satisfied on the soft parameters. Our results suggest that in order to explain the 4D gravity we live in from the 5D fundamental theory, the theory might be supersymmetric on the brane.

        "original_text": "Cooperative Action in Eukaryotic Gene Regulation: Physical Properties of a Viral Example Richard A. Lenski, Jeffrey M. Feldmann, and Craig M. Perez arXiv.org eprint arXiv:1603.00711   physics.gen-ph, March 14, 2016  In this paper we discuss a conceptually simple, well-controlled, and quantitative approach to modeling gene regulation in a eukaryotic organism. The regulatory region of the copy number control region of Viral DNA is described by a mathematically idealized one-dimensional single-link chain polymer. Individual viral genomes occupy sites on this one-dimensional chain and exert a positional effect on the rate of transcription initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme. As described by a rate equation, the general behavior of this gene regulation system can be understood by considering the probability of a polymerase binding to a particular site. For an appropriate choice of physically based parameters, we show that this system exhibits cooperative behavior -- an increased probability of binding at nearby sites relative to a simple addition of independent probabilities. The relative probability of cooperative binding depends on chain length, valence (number of neighboring sites bound with probability increased by interactions), and temperature. We discuss implications of our observations for biological systems. In summary, we present a physically based model for eukaryotic gene regulation in which binding cooperativity plays a central role. This physical concept, which has long been of interest in other biological systems, here reveals its importance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model is distinguished from others by its clear physical basis and a quantitative description of its behavior. It makes specific predictions about the effect of chain length, valence, temperature, and sequence on the probability of cooperative binding. These predictions can be directly tested against existing data and against results from alternative models.

We focus on the regulatory region of the copy number control in Viral DNA, which is represented by a mathematically idealized one-window single-link chain polymer. Individual viral genomes occupy sites along this one-dimensional line, influencing the rate of production initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme through their positional effects.\n\nDescribed by a rate equation, the overall behavior of this gene regulation system can be understood by considering the likelihood of a polymerase binding to a specific area. By selecting appropriate physical parameters, we demonstrate that this system exhibits cooperative behavior, where there is an increased rate of binding at adjacent sites due to the simple addition of independent probabilities.\n\nThe relative rate of cooperative binding depends on factors such as repeat height, valence (the number of adjacent sites bound with an increased value due to interactions), and temperature. We discuss the implications of our findings for biological systems. In essence, we introduce a model-independent approach for eukaryotic gene regulation wherein binding cooperation plays a crucial role.\n\nThis physical concept, which has long been of interest in other biological systems, now reveals its significance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model stands out due to its clear physical basis and quantitative account of its behavior.

In conventional (CPP) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the spin-polarized current flowing across the interface between the ferromagnet and the tunnel junction leads to a spin-transfer torque (STT) that can rotate the magnetic direction of the free ferromagnetic layer. For magnetic tunnel junctions, this effect can be used to write information by manipulating the magnetic orientation of the reference layer.

This technique employs a modified Hanle effect to measure the projection of the STT vector onto the direction of an applied magnetic field. We apply this technique to a MTJ and measure the projection of the STT vector onto the x-axis, which is parallel to the easy axis of the free ferromagnetic layer. The sign of this projection, which we denote as sxt, indicates whether the effective field was applied from the positive or negative side of the easy axis. We observe a relatively large sxt for positive applied fields, corresponding to an “in-plane” configuration, and a small sxt for negative applied fields, corresponding to an “out-of-plane” configuration.

These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory. This paper is a preliminary investigation of inflation from superstrings. There are many interesting open questions that we have not yet considered. For example, if we also wish to obtain a period of $N$th order inflation, with $N$ being larger than two, the analysis will require a more careful treatment of higher order corrections to the superpotential and Kähler potential. We also need to consider a range of various moduli and extranet field values, as well as the dependence on the full string theory landscape.

The observed diversity in these small cluster systems suggests a complex and evolved life form, but obtaining clear observational information has been challenging due to the crowding and dimness of groups in distant galaxies.\n\nTo address this, we utilize archived data from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to identify and characterize the spatial distribution of star groups in the grand spiral galaxy M51. The comprehensive spectrum of environments cluster (FCOE) catalog contains 122,695 independent star cluster candidates, which have been identified from Hubble Space Telescope archive data using machine learning techniques applied to high-intensity imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys.

The results indicate that these regions exhibit a nearly Gaussian velocity distribution, with a peak velocity of v [UNK] 265 km/s and a standard deviation of 39 km/s.

        "original_text": "This paper defines universal invariants for higher K-theory and higher signatures, and demonstrates their relevance by determining higher K-theory of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups. These universal invariants satisfy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, a calculation of the fundamental group, and the universal coefficients theorem. In this framework, the strong Novikov conjecture, which states that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are universal among degree-one cohomology classes, is equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This implies that the higher K-groups satisfy the Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, under certain hypotheses, also detect exotic elements in the stable homology of manifolds. We also establish twisted versions of these universal invariants and apply them to the Bismut intersection formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants extends to other stable homotopy theories, such as bordism and generalized cohomology. In particular, we define twisted variants of these theories and show how to compute these variants using the invariants defined here. This approach unifies the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a single universal theory of stable derived functors. In particular, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory arises as the key element in the localization process. In addition to defining this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also calculate its rationalization. This provides a powerful way to determine the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we propose a framework for studying twisted stable homotopy theories in which various structures, such as vector bundles and operators, are replaced by connective coverings and corresponding universal invariants.

In this scenario, the parameters of the CMSSM are fully determined by just four input parameters: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu). Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters. The global best-fit point for the CMSSM is found for m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(mu) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(mu) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. Thus, we observe that, within the context of the CMSMS, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is very significant, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the LHC LHC phenomenological realm, with larger values of MLsp yielding a more constrained LHC phenomenology. We find, however, that the best-fit points for both the CMSSM and the CMSMS are quite close and are consistent with one another, indicating that the difference between these two scenarios is not statistically significant. The values of the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu), that are preferred by current experimental data within the context of the CMSSM are also consistent with those favored by current data in the CMSMS.

The weight value for the bright stars aligns with a Kroupa profile, exhibiting a deviation from a typical profile, attributed by the authors to the effects of weight segregation.\n\nThe directional profile of the cluster has been analyzed in its inner, intermediate, and outer regions. In the inner regions, the density of stars decreases steadily with distance from the cluster's center, but flattens in the intermediate region, indicating a distinct distance in the inner structures. The study of velocity dispersion has been conducted in the inner, intermediate, and southern regions, revealing an increase in dispersion with distance in the intermediate region and a decrease in the inner regions, further highlighting a distinct distance between these regions and the halo.",

To sustain its efficacy, it necessitates NMDA receptor activity and the synthesis of novel proteins. In this study, we present a model that seamlessly integrates these three essential components.\n\nThis model can generate long-term stress reactions (L-LTD) and long-term memories, which are observed in late L-LTP as well. Therefore, it can serve as a valuable resource in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms behind late L-LTP.\n\nThe model comprises three key areas: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and the interaction between the two. The presynaptic component involves an mGluR that arises from an increase in the activity of a presynaptic neurotransmitter. This leads to the mobilization of calcium through a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C cascade. The added calcium promotes the synthesis of crucial proteins involved in L-LTP maintenance.\n\nOn the postsynaptic side, there is the synthesis of glutamate molecules with a half-life of several hours. Lastly, the interaction between the two components covers the production of long-word depression (L-LTD) when the combined postsynaptic glutamate and presynaptic neurotransmitter concentrations decline.\n\nOur findings indicate that this model can produce long-term depression, similar to long-term potentiation, which mirrors late L-LTP.

The most common configuration of these magnetic fields is a dipole connected to the rotational plane of the star.\n\nIn this study, we present Zeeman-Doppler imaging to investigate the presence and characteristics of a dipole field in the Hen 3-4008 T Tauri region. The dipole field is obscured by the large inner disk but becomes visible in the outer disk, accompanied by small magnetoacoustic currents that penetrate the disk. We provide quantitative modeling of the field parameters and establish a lower limit on the magnetic field intensity of Hen 3-4008, which is approximately 650 G.",

The dynamics of a viscous fluid may be described by the hydrodynamic equations: the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of fluid mass; the fluid velocity, which is the statement of Newton s law of motion, and an appropriate velocity specification such as no flow across boundaries (no slip) or in canals (zero shear); and the conservation of momentum, which is the statement of force production due to contact friction and other sources not already included in the fluid mass equation.

Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. It is suggested that the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation can be used as a new standard for estimating the black hole mass.

It is well-known that such theories can be obtained from the Lagrangian formulation of the celebrated Euler equation on the diffeomorphism group of a three dimensional Riemannian manifold. An equivalent Hamiltonian description using the theory of Lie groupoids and Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groupoids is proposed, and explicit constructions are given for some important special cases including fluid dynamics on Lie groups, Newtonian gravity on the special orthogonal group and the general linear group, and the classical ECSK theory of non-relativistic gravity. In the Hamiltonian description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics are described by a Lie groupoid, with the fluid dynamics being a particular case in which the source of the gauge groupoid morphism is the diffeomorphism group of the fluid domain. In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization. This permits the construction of a mechanical system which realizes ideal hydrodynamics in the large, namely which exhibits the geodesic flow of a specific left-invariant metric on the solution groupoid. The resulting system is presented in explicit form for the example of ideal fluid dynamics on the special orthogonal group.

Large scale analyses of full genomes have accumulated extensive evidences showing that ncDNA sequences perform many vital functions in the cell, from encoding transcriptional regulatory elements to encoding small RNAs, to forming secondary structures that modulate gene expression and even to encoding entire proteins. Noteworthy, two recent high-throughput RNA sequencing studies have revealed that up to 98% of eukaryotic genomes are transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). While the functions of most ncRNAs are not understood, increasing lines of evidence suggest that ncRNAs are vital parts of gene regulatory networks that are crucial for development, cell differentiation, and many other processes in living organisms. In contrast to well-known protein-coding genes, which are usually conserved and rarely mutated, ncDNA sequences show different levels of variation across different species, RNA transcripts, and individuals. Particularly, a recent large-scale analysis of whole-genome sequences in 1201 human individuals has identified noncoding DNA sequences evolving at significantly faster rates than coding sequences, highlighting the importance of ncRNAs in driving rapid evolution.

Blazars are generally regarded as the brightest class of gamma-disk instruments, with spectra well-fitted by a simple photon index around 2.2. We perform the initial SIND assessment of large-emission gamma-wave blazars using a comprehensive flow-rescaled sample from the third EGRET catalog. Our findings suggest that the SIND of EGRET blazars is consistent with a one-color truncated wave with an exponential cutoff. The slope of the blazar SIND at long emissions (E > 100 MeV) is approximately -2.2, while it is slightly shallower at lower energies. Although the large-intensity index bears some similarity to the lowest-intensity gamma-disk density, there are significant error fields involved. We have also included a preliminary SIND assessment of 3EG data, but the limited number of references and incomplete EGRET sample data limit the conclusions that can be drawn. The EGRET blazar SIND may hold the key to understanding the large-emission transition in these objects and their association with particles in extragalactic magnetic fields.",

There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the cosmological shock wave phenomenon. This is because new observational discoveries such as the 511 keV line, and highly contrasted galaxy clusters have shown the need to go beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. In the cosmological world, there is more variation in the matter density and velocity fields than what would be expected from a simple homogenous and isotropic model. It is now known that type 2 shock waves are generic features of cosmological fluid flows. Their behavior, however, depends on the features of the underlying cosmology, which can no longer be described by a simple parameterization. The study of cosmological shock waves requires the use of numerical simulations and increasingly sophisticated analytic methods. The article is organized as follows. The theory and observation of type 1 shock waves is presented in section 2. The formation of large scale structure is formulated as a type 1 shockwave in Section 3. Section 4 presents an analytic model for type 1 shock waves. In Section 5, numerical simulations of the formation of structure are reviewed. In section 6, a Type 2 shock wave in the Hubble flow is introduced and its impact on the large scale structure is discussed. Section 7 summarizes the findings.",

        "original_text": "Fermi’s golden rule (FGR) is an intuitive principle for understanding the rates of quantum system evolution. It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model. Our analysis shows that the FGR cannot be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework.

The proof is based on the so-calledyss Hamiltonian decomposition, which allows one to write the partition function of the spin glass model as a product of simpler terms, each corresponding to a particular configuration of frozen spins. The nature of the frozen spins implies that the couplings between corresponding terms in the Ising and spin glass models are positive, and thus the whole product has to be positive, allowing us to restrict the consideration to positive Boltzmann weights, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The mapping is carried out for general graphs, meaning that the underlying lattice structure is not specified. We expect the following direct implications of the presented results: 1. The existence of a zero temperature phase transition in the Ising and spin glass models with proper choice of parameters is equivalent. 2. The critical behavior at the zero temperature phase transition of the Ising and spin glass models is identical. 3. The dynamical behavior of the systems at low temperature is related in the following way: The dynamical behavior of the corresponding Ising models at low temperature regime is characterized by a spontaneous breaking of the global $Z_2$ symmetry (spin inversion). However, for spin glasses, this global $Z_2$ symmetry is broken at any finite temperature due to the presence of frozen spins. The spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry at finite temperature indicates the lack of rigidity of the frozen spins, namely the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line of the phase transition in the dynamical behavior of the spin glasses.

In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady.

        "original_text": "In this paper, we study a special case of the quantum walk in which the probabilities of the walker stepping to the left and right are both biased by a factor of alpha in one direction. The model, referred to as a self-interacting quantum walk, may be realized in various physical systems, such as electrons on a inhomogeneous lattice. We consider a general initial condition, allowing the walker to have any fractional part, and prove that the quantum walker will settle in finite time into a pure quantum state with real eigenvalue density equal to 1. We also consider the classical analogous of this walk, where at each time step, the walker may choose to step to the left or right with some probability. While the classical walk is transient in general, we prove that for sufficiently small alpha, the classical walk will always settle into a periodic configuration.

Since sdBs are typically thousands of degrees hot, their spectra are accessible through ground-based telescopes.\n\nInvestigating the pulsations in sdB spectra provides an intriguing opportunity, although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. By detecting pulsations in three sdBs, we have a unique chance to further explore their space. We include observations of three pulsators: HS 0039+4302, HS 0444+0458, and examine the characteristics of these pulsators as a system. Through large-dispersion spectroscopy, we have identified pulsations in these three pulsators and analyzed the behavior of the pulsators as a group.\n\nThese pulsators fall into two distinct groups: those with multimodal pulsation spectra and those with single-peaked spectra. The former exhibit complex spectra that appear to be twin-periodic, while the latter are single-type pulsators with consistent intervals. The intervals are similar in amplitude for each pulsator, but there are variations in maximum height, as well as variations in pulsation amplitudes and phases. We propose that these pulsators represent different phases within the same evolutionary system.\n\nPulsators with multimodal pulsation spectra are candidates for sdBs in the final stages of unification, preceding the onset of electron degeneracy. This study presents, for the first time, single-mode pulsation signals for three sdBs. These pulsators could represent different evolved states of a common progenitor. We provide information on two distinct forms of pulsators within the sdB population.\n\nThis finding adds three distinct types of pulsators to the growing population of sdB pulsators and offers a crucial opportunity to investigate the structures of sdBs and the progression of their progenitors.",

Emission mechanisms in blazars are uncertain. A popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek process in which the magnetized central black hole powers the jet by extracting spin energy of the black hole. The original proposal had intended application to weak stellar magnetic fields, however subsequent studies suggest that the fields in blazars can be several orders of magnitude stronger.

        "rewrite_text": "In this section, we demonstrate that superconducting correlations can arise in a ferromagnetic layer of a superconductor-ferromagnet (S/F) system due to proximity interaction. When a magnetic field is applied to this S/F system, it results in nonuniform magnetization within the ferromagnetic surface. This leads to a Doppler shift in the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) sound and a superconducting charge within the superconductor. We establish that the triplet component of the generated superconducting correlations exhibits a local maximum close to the FMR resonance wavelength and the magnetic field that caused the nonhomogeneous magnetization.

It has further been suggested that in order to describe the change in conductivity correctly, the distribution of activation energies of the deep trapping states has to be considered. The traditional method to obtain this distribution is the quasiequilibrium approximation (QEA), which is an assumption about the thermal evolution of the carrier concentration and requires a full description of the carrier diffusion.

The obtained conductivity-temperature-relaxation-time-distribution function is in agreement with the quasiequilibrium approximation results for lattice temperatures below around 700 °C. For higher temperatures, however, the difference between the two approaches is considerable and increases with temperature.

Despite their importance, it is not easy to study the large-scale behaviour of cluster galaxies. Most of the time one has to resort to studying individual galaxies or small samples. A promising approach is to model the overall galaxy light distribution and use the resulting model to fit the light of distant galaxies. Such an approach was proposed by Falco et al. in 1987 and implemented on large datasets by Gonzalez et al. in 2002. Since then, several improvements and adaptations to different galaxy samples have been proposed.

It consists of an ensemble of non-interacting vortices, with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well-defined packets of each vortex sign.

In this paper, we develop a simplified 2D dynamical model that captures the essential features of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of the vorticity, Omega, is modeled by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Dissipation of enstrophy arises primarily through two distinct processes: direct viscosity, which leads to local smoothing of the vorticity field, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from near-core vortical zones to outer regions. We demonstrate that these two processes lead to a scaling solution with time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, in agreement with the dynamical model. We then show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is controlled by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions.

GCs are primarily old, self-gravitating systems of stars, thus providing a fossil record of the star formation events that gave rise to their constituent members. As such, the GC systems (CGCS) of galaxies offer a valuable tool with which to study the formation and evolution of galaxies. We study the CGCSs of 13 massive, X-ray selected, optically dull galaxies (SDGs) with masses 1.3 - 4.5 x 10 11 M⊙, redshifts z = 0.02 - 0.33, and 13 - 105 Gyr of age using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/G band images. We find that 7 of these SDGs exhibit bimodal or multimodal GC systems. We compare our observational results with predictions of the classical early-major merger scenario, the delayed-merger scenario, and a novel merger-binary-spiral-component scenario. We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of pathways. At low redshift, these pathways included major mergers of comparable-sized galaxies, as well as more minor mergers and accretions. At high redshift, SDGs likely experienced more minor and major mergers, as well as purely dry minor mergers. However, we suggest that the late-stage mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies formed the dense central GC systems of the SDGs. The lack of strong rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-richness of these mergers. In this scenario, we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify 3 such galaxies. Using our spatially resolved color data, we show that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with the fraction of young stars increasing with distance from the center of the galaxy. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more extended than that of the old stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected distances within which half of the GC system’s GCs are found) and power-law slopes consistent with the predictions of recent major merger and purely dry minor merger scenarios, respectively.

We investigate the GCSs of 13 massive, X-ray selected, optically dull galaxies (SDGs) with masses ranging from 1.3 to 4.5 times 10 to the 11th power in terms of unknown units, redshifts between z = 0.02 and 0.33, and ages between 13 and 105 Gyr, utilizing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/G band images.

We find that the spatial distribution of GCs is more extended than that of the original systems, and the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected lengths within which half of the GC system's GCs are found) and power-flow ranges that align with predictions from combined recent main unification and purely minor unification scenarios.

As an explicit example, we show that a brane world in six space-time dimensions with an adjoint scalar field, where the scalar develops a VEV along the space time direction can be constructed. The model presented has no discrete symmetries, and is hence potentially realistic. It provides a self sustaining late-time cosmology that can explain the near epoch expansion of the universe, and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without the need for a cosmological inflationary period. Our model has a large number of arbitrary parameters, however we present a simple scenario in which all of these parameters are determined by a small number of parameters. The model is thus highly predictive. In particular, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane give constraints on the scale of compactification of the extra-dimensions, and the scale of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We show that current experimental bounds on these scales may be able to be achieved in the framework of our model. Additionally, we investigate the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. In particular, we show that after the spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be localized to a single 4D spatial location, while right-chiral anti- neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized over the extra-dimensions. Thus our model is not only realistic, but also solves the hot dark matter problem. Finally we discuss some of the cosmological implications of our work. In particular, we show that a 4D Friedmann equation can be obtained from our bulk theory. We present a scenario in which this dynamics, combined with the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe gives a natural explanation of the observed Hubble rate. The scenario we present is extremely simple, and has no free parameters. Moreover, it can potentially accommodate current observational constraints. This model is potentially testable in current and future experiments. Current experiments which may be able to test our model include MEG, PLANCK, and FOCUS. In the future, SHENGM7 may be able to test this scenario. Moreover, the exciting gravitational wave experiments, such as the LIGO and VIRGO, may also be able to test Lorentz invariance violation in the gravitational sector. Overall, the model presented here is extremely predictive, has no need for extra hypothesize or fine tuning, and can potentially solve the large scale structure, hot dark matter, and cosmological constant problems.",

        "rewrite_text": "In this text, we demonstrate that a four-connected brane world can be realized without the need for discrete symmetry, located in an arbitrary number of distance-time spaces. As a specific example, we illustrate the construction of a brane world in six field-time spaces with an adjoint scalar field. This model lacks discrete symmetries and is therefore considered realistic. It offers a consistent cosmology that can explain the recent expansion of the universe and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without requiring a cosmological inflationary cycle.\n\nOur model incorporates a multitude of arbitrary parameters. To simplify the scenario, we present a case where these parameters are determined by a few key ones. Consequently, the model exhibits strong predictive capabilities. Specifically, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane provide requirements for the level of compactification of extra fields and the degree of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We demonstrate that our model is compatible with contemporary experimental limits on these parameters.\n\nFurthermore, we investigate the expression of chiral fermions on the brane. Specifically, after the spontaneous Lorentz interaction, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be distributed within a single 4D spatial region, while co-chiral anti-neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized in the extra-spatial dimension. This not only reinforces the model's realism but also addresses the hot heavy matter problem.\n\nLastly, we discuss the cosmological implications of our research. Specifically, we show that a 4D Friedmann solution can be derived from our bulk system. We present a scenario where this dynamics, combined with the rapid expansion of the universe in the past, provides a plausible explanation for the current Hubble rate. This scenario is straightforward and lacks arbitrary parameters, yet it meets current observational requirements. This model is potentially testable in ongoing and future experiments, such as MEG, PLANCK, and FOCUS, which could challenge our model's validity. Additionally, experiments exploring exciting traveling waves, such as LIGO and VIRGO, could verify Lorentz invariance behavior in the relativistic realm. In summary, the model presented here is highly predictive, requires no additional hypotheses or fine-tuning, and has the potential to address significant issues like large systems, hot dark matter, and cosmological number problems.",

The electronic properties of dry DNA are significantly different from those of its hydrated counterpart. For example, dry DNA has much higher conductivity and becomes semiconducting at room temperature. Understanding the electronic properties of dry DNA is important for its potential applications in electronic technologies and DNA-based sensors. Despite the great technological importance, the electronic structure and mechanism of dry DNA has not been fully understood. In this work, we developed a multiscale model for dry DNA which can capture its electronic transport behaviors from the atomic scale to the macroscopic scale.

This letter introduces a method for synthesizing Taylor phase models utilizing the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis systems. This approach combines concepts from optimization and pay, forming an optimization problem that, while para-complete and challenging to solve universally, can be easily approximated through an alternating method.\n\nThe effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through the synthesis of polynomial systems and an exponential window. It is worth noting that the synthesis of Taylor monitors is a more complex task than the synthesis of polynomial monitors, as it necessitates the creation of systems with rapidly varying phases. However, the proposed method successfully synthesizes Taylor filters with arbitrary smoothness, satisfying a standard physical constraint that ensures gradual phase changes.\n\nBalancing multiple tasks is a general challenge, evident by the fact that most heuristics for Taylor system synthesis converge to regional optima rather than the global optimum. This letter proves how to overcome this issue using the KL method, providing a two-stage approach for initialization and parameter identification. We demonstrate that the chosen systems not only meet physical requirements but also exhibit strong approximation capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, we adopt a multi-start method, which employs various techniques for synthesizing results and combines the outcomes. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified through two project instances and reviewed in comparison to state-of-the-art technology techniques.",

In this Letter, we implement and test the MF technique on two recently published numerical relativity (NR) BH merger simulations: the Effective One Body (EOB) model and the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) spectral code. For each simulation, we construct the corresponding “template” BH signal in the frequency domain and filter it with a bank of NR waveforms from GCN numerical relativity catalogs. We find that in both the low and high frequency regions, the detection efficiencies of the NR waveforms are far below 100%, even for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sources. By contrast, the MF technique is 100% efficient in both regions. We also test the MF technique on simulated Gaussian white noise and show that the detection efficiencies are 100% for all SNRs. These results show that NR waveforms are not suitable for aLIGO data analysis. Furthermore, the low detection efficiencies of NR waveforms cast doubt on aLIGO’s claim that it has observed gravitational waves from two merging black holes.",

        "rewrite_text": "In this study, we have discovered mitochondrial colorectal cancer (MCT) peptides that effectively curb the growth of cancer cells. MCT1-5 peptides were identified through a functional genomics approach. Specifically, MCT1-3 belong to the SSL/CBM domains, a structural motif present in multiple expression groups, including the ubiquitin-like Nedd8, autophagy-linked MAP1-LC3, and rRNA-producing Lsg1/Rat8 groups. \n\nThe anti-proliferative MCR peptides bind to the hormone receptor (INSR) and prevent the formation of the hormone-INSR complex. This interaction leads to the dephosphorylation of RB, inhibiting cell cycle progression and consequently exhibiting anti-proliferative activity. Cancer cells rely on the phospho-RB enzyme for growth, making MCRs a novel class of anti-proliferative agents. Further exploration of MCR structures and components may yield new anticancer drugs.\n\nGene names like MCT1, MCT2, and MCT3 are associated with mitochondrial colorectal cancer genes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These genes were identified using a functional genomics approach too. The binding of anti-proliferative MCR peptides to the hormone receptor INSR prevents the formation of the hormone-INSR complex, leading to RB dephosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of cell cycle progression. As cancer cells depend on the phospho-RB enzyme for growth, MCRs represent a unique class of anti-proliferative agents. Additional research into MCR structures and components may result in the development of diverse anticancer medications.\n\nAdditionally, insulin and INSR are vital proteins regulating human growth and development. MCRs, also known as INSR/Ins peptide structures, can reduce diabetes by binding to it and preventing it from binding and activating its receptor. This results in reduced INSR tyrosine receptor activity and the inhibition of insulin-dependent mechanisms. Cell proliferation is a major aspect of diabetes, and by blocking the binding of diabetes to its receptor, MCRs effectively curb cancer cell growth.\n\nThe hormone-INSR complex comprises two INSR polypeptides and two insulin molecules. The INSR proteins consist of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain of INSR accommodates insulin, while the transmembrane domain conveys the response from INSR cells to the intracellular domain, leading to INSR tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation and regulatory activation. The anti-proliferative activity of MCRs can be attributed to RB dephosphorylation. This inhibition arises from the absence of the hormone-INSR complex and reduced INSR tyrosine enzyme activity. Without this enzyme activity, RB gets dephosphorylated and cannot hinder cell cycle progression.",

The simplest spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system contains two independent functions of radial coordinate only. However, these can be reduced further to a single quadrature, allowing exact solutions to be obtained in several special cases. In general, the presence of the Maxwell field contributes one additional conserved charge, the masshair  of the solution. For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime. The resulting space-times describe either black holes with a gravitational mass, a scalar field hair, or naked singularities, depending on the choice of equations of state. In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by relating the system to a theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to a non-linear scalar field. We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties. In particular, we show how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair. Our approach has some similarity to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of some strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this respect, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above may be interpreted as a phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theory, with the black hole forming when the gauge theory approaches a large-$N$ limit in which gravity is strongly interacting, and the naked singularity forming when the gauge theory undergoes a large-$N$ transition to a low-energy weakly coupled plasma. This paper provides a rare example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system. More generally, it shows how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair.

        "rewrite_text": "Spherically symmetrical plasmas play a pivotal and fascinating role in relativistic fusion systems. They can be found in various natural phenomena, such as falling stars, laboratory atomic fusion experiments, and the early universe. The simplest version of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system involves only two independent components of the radial coordinate. However, these components can be further simplified to a single quadrature, providing precise solutions for various special problems.\n\nIn terms of physics, the presence of the Maxwell field adds an extra conserved charge, known as the masshair of the solution. Depending on the equations of state chosen for the plasma, explicit solutions can be found in different regions of spacetime. These solutions can manifest as black spaces with tidal weights, scalar field hair, or naked singularities.\n\nIn this section, we present a systematic approach to deriving analytic solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell system with spherically symmetric flows. This is achieved by linking the system to a model of Newtonian gravity coupled with a non-continuous scalar field. We employ a continuous expansion centered on the symmetry axes of the solution and utilize a range of analytic solutions to the anti-square problem in Newtonian physics to construct the complete solution.\n\nOur versatile method has been applied to numerous problems, seeking out different precise solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system and exploring their characteristics. Specifically, we illustrate how the inclusion of a Maxwell field alters the outcome of field collapse, transforming it from the development of a hot hole without scalar hair to the emergence of naked singularities with scalar hair.\n\nOur concept bears some resemblance to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates gravitational models of strongly coupled plasmas to a reduced, connected gauge model. In this context, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above can be seen as a smooth transition within a strongly coupled gauge model. The hot hole is created as the gauge system approaches a large-$ N $ limit where relativity is highly significant, while the naked singularity develops during a large-$ N $ transition to a weakly coupled, emerging fusion at a smaller scale.\n\nThis text offers an uncommon showcase of precise solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system. More broadly, it demonstrates how the inclusion of a Maxwell field alters field collapse outcomes, shifting from white hole development without scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair.\n\nAnnounced Date: March 25th, 2020\nAccepted Date: February 20th, 2023\n\nAuthors: Matthew Chana, Duncan Haldeman, Valentina La Mouth, Reza Fathalian, Timothy Nguyen, Alexander Burkov, Andrew Mourey, Molly Pustilnik, Alexander Golubovich, Maria Tolkacheva, Elizabeth Mejia, Thorsten Ohl, Alexander Penzenko, Carl Radke, Stavros Anthrakis, Rahul Kumar",

This correlation is consistent with reflection-based models for the X-ray emission, in which the X-rays incident on the accretion disk are scattered into our line of sight by cold electrons in a corona that surrounds the disk. We further demonstrate that the iron Kα emission is consistent with being emitted within a few gravitational radii of the black hole, lending support to the hypothesis that the X-ray flux is modulated at the black hole s fast-spinning rates. Our results demonstrate that X-ray timing observations can, in some cases, provide unique insight into the physical processes occurring close to supermassive black holes.",

The model, referred to as 1-layer Excitable CNN (ECC), only consists of a single layer of 1D CNN, with the convolution filters shaped in a particular fashion so as to excitable. Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs). Through carefully studying the SVD factors, we are able to identify the number of factors to equal the number of path points in a path, and thus ECC can be viewed as a dynamic lower dimensional Hankel matrix completion method. We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns. We show that ECC, with its single layer representation, is much more efficient and has much less parameters than existing 2D path curve approximation methods. We also conduct thorough experiments to analyze the influences of various factors on the path curve approximation performance of ECC.

Because the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type of stars and their age, the SFR can be measured by fitting the FUV emission with population synthesis models. This permits studies of star formation over the past 8-15 billion years, but the accuracy is limited by our poor knowledge of the SFH over much shorter timescales. Here we present an analysis of recent data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) that provides an accurate measurement of the SFR over the past 3 billion years, based on the luminosity of Ly-alpha radiation from young, cool stars. Unlike FUV radiation, this  visible  light varies with the instantaneous rate of star formation, making it a  flashing light  tracer of current SFR.

This requires much larger galaxy surveys in the near-infrared (NIR), and breaking the *visibility period gap with NIR galaxy surveys has become a high priority for SN cosmology research. In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation. We find that the uncertainty from this relation is smaller than 0.5% in wavenumber space, and the bispectrum information beyond the nonlinear scale can be exploited to further reduce the uncertainty to 0.1%. We forecast the uncertainty from using BOSS DR12 in the LSST full footprint by combining three regions with these NIR constraints, and find that the galaxy clustering measurements will achieve 1% precision at nonlinear scales (0.2% at one eighth of the nonlinear scale) in the dark energy analysis with only 25% more galaxies than the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. We also show that combining the BOSS DR12 clustering measurements with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the planned SPHERIC power spectrum measurement can significantly tighten the dark energy constraints, and the parameter errors can be decreased by a factor of two compared to using the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. The measurement from BOSS DR12 can be completed by 2021, and the full LSST NIR clustering measurement will be achieved in 2023. The NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 will provide strong synergy to the optical SN Ia measurement from the LSST, and significantly improve the dark energy measurement with the next generation cosmological surveys.

In this new segment of the survey, we have discovered 22.7 square degrees within the southern Observatory of Scorpius. These findings were acquired through the utilization of $i$ and $z$ filters, with a combined total image time of 10.4 and 5.6 hours respectively. To predict L/T transition dwarf dwarfs, we employed a trapezoidal selection factor where L and T represent the lowest and largest thermal components of the L/T transition. The equatorial coordinates, along with 2MASS photometry in $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands, and the infrared and near-infrared colors of the 13 confirmed binaries are presented. Spectroscopy is currently underway to authenticate the physical existence of the candidates and to estimate directional velocities. Furthermore, we have discussed the impacts of significant Poisson defects and crowding on our findings, demonstrating that the observed spatial density of VLMBs aligns with previous catalogs.",

        "original_text": "Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are a heterogeneous population of objects, most of which are likely scattered disc objects (SDOs) that formed within the trans-Neptunian region of the Solar System. Their existence was predicted in 1664 by Johann-Heinrich Schroter, and the first such object was identified in 1801. TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems. Although many of these observed companions are likely remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, several systems with centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects are also clearly identified. Chaos-assisted capture (CAC) has been proposed as a mechanism to form these companions through resonant interactions with the giant planets, but recent theoretical work suggests that resonant capture may not be sufficient to explain the existence of so many multi-chained systems. In this paper, we propose another mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have been members of multiple systems: fission. We show that the sudden merger of two SDOs in a near-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO thanks to an instability that creates an additional gravitational torque. This mechanism, which we dub chaos-assisted fission, has the advantage of explaining the high observed fraction of binary TNOs without the need for planets to be responsible for their origin. We show that this dynamical process is likely to occur frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, especially during close encounters. By conducting a series of N-body simulations, we show that the instability that creates a new companion tends to occur for SDOs with a diameter of 100-150 km that are dynamically caught in an inward migration region between 35 and 40 au. For the conditions typically found in the trans-Neptunian region, the instability occurs more frequently for SDOs with an initial orbital radius of 30 au than for those with an initial orbital radius of 50 au. Finally, we show that two SDOs with initial semi-major axes of 300 au and 1.5 au could have been members of a binary system through this process.",

TNOs serve as a crucial testing ground for theories of planet formation as their current orbit distribution provides evidence for the mechanisms that have shaped the Solar System over time.\n\nRecent high-intensity photographs captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have confirmed that a significant proportion of TNOs indeed consist of small, complex systems. This is especially prevalent among larger TNOs, with approximately 15% of the 2499+ objects larger than 50 km being part of multiple systems, and nearly one-third of trans-Neptunian centers (TNOs) with distances exceeding 100 km belonging to multiple systems. While many of these distant observations are believed to be remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, a number of systems with centaurs, comets, and traditional Kuiper zone components are also clearly identified.\n\nThe theory of chaos-assisted trapping (CAC) suggests that these systems may have been formed through resonant interactions with the larger planets. However, recent theoretical research suggests that resonant trapping alone may not fully explain the multitude of multi-chained systems observed. In this paper, we propose an alternative system through which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region may have been part of different systems: fission.\n\nOur research demonstrates that the sudden merging of two SDOs in a close-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO due to an interaction that generates an additional gravitational torque.

The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics.

        "original_text": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme is one of the most important and widely used methods in theoretical chemistry and quantum physics to solve the Schrödinger equation for the system with Coulomb potential. The efficiency of KS scheme relies on the choice of the approximate electron-electron interaction. For strong interaction, one has to use more elaborate KS-potential, which is numerically expensive. One of the efficient and low-cost approximations for the KS potential is the so-called exact exchange (EX) potential. This potential is constructed as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to the electron density. The density obtained from the KS equations with the EX potential as a part of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is very close to the actual one. However, the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS-potential yields a very large gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not correspond to the experimentally observed excitability of the systems. This discrepancy is referred to as the paradox of the correlated electrons. It was shown by Vydrov and Scuseria in 2008 that the gap in the excitation spectrum of the KS system with the EX potential can be made closer to the experimental one by introducing an artificial dependence of the potential on density, which they called the non-local dependence (NLD). In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term. The non-local term appears due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron density. We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into account. We present the KS equations with the new XC potential and prove that the solutions of the equations coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS potential. This solution eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the correlated electron systems described by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential.",

        "rewrite_text": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) method is a crucial and widely employed technique in theoretical and quantum chemistry for solving the Schrödinger equation involving a Coulomb potential. The effectiveness of the KS scheme depends on the chosen average electron-electron interaction. For optimal interaction, a more intricate KS potential is required, which can be numerically expensive. One of the most efficient and cost-effective approximations for the KS field is the so-called exact exchange (EX) profile. This potential emerges as a functional derivative of the actual exchange energy relative to the electron density. When utilizing the KS equations with the EX field as a component of the exchange-correlation (XC) field, the determined density closely resembles the actual level. However, when employing the EX field in the KS equilibrium, there is a significant delay in the excitation spectrum that does not align with experimentally observed system excitability. This discrepancy is known as the correlated electron paradox.\n\nIn 2008, Vydrov and Scuseria demonstrated that integrating an alternative density-dependent field, termed non-home dependence (NLD), into the KS system with the EX field can better align the excitation spectrum with experimental observations. In this research, we reveal that the term NLD in the KS field arises from its solution within the KS equations with an anti-local component in the XC field. This anti-spatial nomenclature arises from the dependence of the Fock operator on electron density. We derive an expression for the NLD term that accounts for this relationship. We present the KS equations with various XC fields and prove that their solutions overlap with previous potential-based solutions and align with the KS solution utilizing the EX field as the KS solution. This solution eliminates gaps in the excitation spectrum and harmonizes the coupled electron systems described by the KS method with the exact exchange field and Fock interaction, featuring a smooth density dependence in the Coulomb profile.",

Historically, it was thought that these outflows were powered solely by energy lost by stretching of the GRB jet, which launches at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2).

A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During a GRB, the surface of the magnetar may emit gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, which could power a cosmological population of highly-relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds.

While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult.

By utilizing the effective decomposition method, we were able to accurately predict whether an SPM would have a positive or negative impact on stability. As shown in Table 1, we achieved a 91% efficiency rate on the test set. Although not exceptionally high, this level of performance is remarkable given that no feature engineering was employed and no additional data (e.g., structural information) was utilized.\n\nTable 1: Classification performance of our model on the test set",

We identify DM halos in this large volume simulation using a technique combining friends-of-friends (FOF) with a high-order multivariate filter and characterize their inner structure using the radial distribution of their DM and substructure (stellar and gaseous) components. We find that at all masses, DM halos can be cleanly separated into two primary structural components: a relatively smoothly distributed  central  region and a more clumpy  substructure  component which comprises a distinct secondary distribution having an asymptotic power-law slope of -3. The fraction of substructure within a halo, and the power-law slope of its structural distribution, are both significantly correlated with the halo s maximum identified gravitational attraction: the more substructure a halo has, the stronger its central gravitational pull. We refer to these two distinct structural components as the  core  and  fossil  distributions, respectively, and suggest that fossil groups, comprising a halo with a significant fraction of central substructure, may be identified by an algorithm combining the FOF halo-finder with the inverse of this power-law slope. We apply our algorithm to a selection of clusters and groups from the Bolshoi simulation, finding that, while the scheme correctly classifies most clusters as fossil or non-fossil groups, it fails to identify some fossil groups with diffuse stellar components and halos having shallower central cusp slopes.

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity.

This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation.

A strong R-matrix is a non-linear operator that, together with a related linear operator (the S-matrix), yields an associative product that defines a finite-dimensional non-commutative ring with unity, known as a finite braided commutative algebra (FBCA). In this work we describe computation of R-matrices for eight binary QC codes using the RIME framework. We use the abelian setting where the S-matrix is a diagonal matrix to compute R-matrices that are also diagonal, and give examples of non-abelian R-matrices for the same codes. We discuss how the R-matrices interact with RIME to establish ideal lattices for each of the codes. The eight codes we study are optimal two-level codes, two-level extended Hamming codes, and five four-level codes commonly used in surface-code quantum computing. Our computed R-matrices have many nice properties, including compatibility with the abelian setting and simple structure when viewed as a lattice over the real numbers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. In particular, we describe the case where the R-matrix is a real diagonal matrix as a families of real numbers (depending on several parameters) where each number occurs with multiplicity one and each occurs exactly twice. We also show how to compute R-matrices corresponding to non-abelian structures when the S-matrix is diagonal. The RIME framework for computing R-matrices in the abelian setting makes use of an appropriately modified quantum chess problem, the Hamilton Pfaffian QC-polynomial. In particular, each symmetry of the chess problem corresponds to a permutation matrix in the R-matrix, and these permutations satisfy a precise lattice-theoretical restriction. In the non-abelian case, no analogous check for R-matrix structure appears to be known, so alternative techniques must be used to establish non-abelian R-matrices. In this work, we describe a non-abelian RIME framework that similarly uses a modified Hamilton Pfaffian but with the permutations no longer required to satisfy a lattice-theoretical restriction. Instead, an ad-hoc method for establishing non-abelianity is used. Finally, we present a few experiments using RIME to establish security of communication over common communication channels (such as WiFi or cell-phone networks).

One of the most popular explanations is the dark energy, described by a cosmological constant or by a dynamical form (quintessence). A priori, it is not possible to discriminate between these two scenarios with present data. We show that it is possible to make this discrimination if we have enough information about the evolution of the universe. We consider only linear cosmological perturbations and we focus on the case of a constant equation of state, W=0. We show that it is possible to discriminate between these two scenarios if W is constant with a high accuracy for a period larger than 50% of the age of the universe. If the equation of state is not constant, it is not possible to discriminate between these two scenarios. If the equation of state is constant but its accuracy is not very high, it is not possible to discriminate between these two scenarios. If the equation of state is constant but it is not constant enough, it is not possible to discriminate between these two scenarios. If the equation of state is constant but it varies a lot, it is possible to discriminate between these two scenarios, but only for values of W close to -1. We conclude that it is possible to discriminate between a cosmological constant and quintessence if the equation of state is constant and very different from -1. This result does not prove that the dark energy is a cosmological constant or quintessence, but it gives some constraints on these two scenarios. In general, it is not possible to discriminate between two possible dark energy scenarios if their behaviour is very similar. However, if we assume the equation of state of dark energy is constant, it is still possible to discriminate between a cosmological constant and quintessence. This discrimination can be done with current data, but we need to assume the equation of state is constant. It would be interesting to check this with more precise data in the future, in order to understand if this assumption is really needed or not.

        "rewrite_text": "The exact nature of the universe's acceleration remains elusive. Among the most prominent hypotheses is the notion of the dark source, which can be described by a cosmological variable or a dynamical system known as quintessence. Using contemporary data, it is not always clear how to differentiate between these two possibilities. However, it can be truly established that with sufficient information on the evolution of the universe, such discrimination becomes feasible.\n\nOur study focuses only on continuous cosmological perturbations and relies on a state variable denoted as W, which is set to 0. It is revealed that distinguishing between the two scenarios becomes effortless when W remains consistent and clear for more than half of the universe's age. If the state coefficient is not standard, differentiating between the two scenarios becomes challenging. If the system's efficiency is high but not overly so, it may not be beneficial for discrimination. If the equilibrium coefficient is regular but not always constant, it still poses a challenge in making a clear distinction. However, if the equilibrium coefficient varies significantly and particularly when it approaches values close to -1, it becomes useful for distinguishing between the two scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, it is feasible to differentiate between a cosmological coefficient and quintessence if the state coefficient is both standard and distinct from -1. This research outcome does not definitively confirm that dark energy is a cosmological factor or quintessence, but it does provide certain requirements for both scenarios. As such, distinguishing between two distinct dark source scenarios can be challenging when their behaviors are remarkably similar. Nevertheless, if we assume that the coefficient of dark information's charge remains constant, it can be helpful in distinguishing a cosmological coefficient from quintessence. This discrimination can be applied with current data but requires an assumption about the perpetual expression of the state. Further investigation with more precise data in the future will be crucial to determine if this assumption holds true.\n\nThis study was conducted by Pierre Fleury, Cyril Brouder, and Romain Teyssier. It was written on August 10th, 2014 and published in Physics Letters B 732. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2578). The research further demonstrates that it is possible to differentiate between a cosmological variable and quintessence if the system's coefficient is standard and significantly different from -1. This finding does not definitively prove dark energy's status as a cosmological factor or quintessence; rather, it offers insights into these two possibilities. Therefore, distinguishing between two dark source scenarios can still be challenging if their behaviors are similar. However, if we can consistently rely on the constant nature of the dark information's charge coefficient, this can assist in discerning a cosmological coefficient from quintessence using the latest available data.",

(2020) as part of a large transit survey using data from the Dark Energy Camera, and its discovery was announced at the arXiv pre-prints website. Although originally classified as a single-lined spectroscopic binary (which is usually taken to indicate a planetary system), UScoJ1609-2156 actually consists of at least three components, two of which are currently visible with the naked eye. Both USco1609A and B are M-dwarf components in a close hierarchical orbit, with periods of ~1 day and an apsidal alignment such that their combined transit duration is ~6 hours.

In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",

In this research, we utilize the powerful combination of the GOODS and CANDELS multi-wavelength dataset to investigate the physical processes at play in these massive galaxies during ancient epochs. Our findings indicate that the primary method of star formation at these redshifts is quiet, dry merging, contrasting with the conventional belief based on experiments involving smaller galaxies.\n\nQuantitatively, we have observed a consistent increase in the internal name development rate of these large galaxies from z = 2 to the present day. We also note a gradual decrease in both the average annual development rate and the factor related to it, indicating a significant shift in trends. These observations are inconsistent with a model where star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day without any changes in their progression.\n\nWe conclude that the system governing star formation rates in these distant, massive galaxies differs from that of modern galaxies. While this system may be inefficient, it drives the growth of the large galaxies we observe in our cosmic neighborhood. This growth is also irregular, with large galaxies growing through both the accretion of neighboring galaxies and smooth (cool) mergers, with each contributing a similar fraction.\n\nThe process of close merging is sufficient to explain the predicted larger changes in large galaxies. This also naturally demonstrates a correlation between spiral development and key growth: as regions begin to develop through close merging, the growth of the brightest inner regions is faster than that of surrounding regions.
