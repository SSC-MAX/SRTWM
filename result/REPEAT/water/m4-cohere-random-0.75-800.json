We show that there exists an optimal coupling strength for each individual oscillator to achieve maximum energy transfer efficiency among all other oscillators. The results are obtained through numerical simulations on both small-scale and large-scale networks. In particular, we find that the energy transfer efficiency decreases when the number of nodes increases beyond a certain threshold value. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the total amount of available energy per node decreases rapidly due to the increase of the number of nodes. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings to real-world problems.

The observed profiles show that the blue wing is enhanced relative to the red one at all heights above the limb where we can see the flare emission. This effect is more pronounced for higher altitudes. We find that this behavior cannot be explained solely by Doppler shifts due to bulk plasma motions along the LOS. In addition, our modeling shows that the observed profile shapes cannot be reproduced without including nonthermal electron beams as an additional heating source. \n \n Keywords: Solar flare, chromospheric lines, nonthermal electrons, radiative hydrodynamics model, RH code, Mg II k line, line asymmetry. 1 Introduction \n \n During solar flares, intense energy release leads to rapid changes in physical conditions throughout the atmosphere of the Sun. These include temperature increases up to several million degrees Kelvin, strong magnetic fields, high densities, and large velocities. All these factors affect the shape of spectral lines emitted by different atmospheric layers. For example, it has been shown that the intensity ratio between two Fe I lines formed at different temperatures depends on the height of formation of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips 2004) . Also, the presence of nonthermal electrons causes significant deviations from Maxwellian velocity distributions leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al. (1990) ; Doschek et al. (1991) ), while bulk flows lead to Doppler shifts of the line center position (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Brosius 2009 ). Therefore, studying the temporal evolution of the line profiles provides important information about the dynamics of the flaring region.

We focus on double white dwarfs, which are expected to be one of the most important sources in terms of GW energy density and event rate. In particular we investigate how their properties depend on the initial conditions at formation time as well as on the subsequent evolution driven by nuclear burning and orbital decay due to emission of gravitational waves.

We find that the number of systems detectable within a given volume depends strongly on the assumed distribution function of binary parameters such as mass ratio q = M2/M1 or total system mass Mtot = M1 + M2. This dependence arises because different distributions lead to very different fractions of binaries with favorable orientations relative to the detector s line-of-sight. If all binaries have random orientation then only about 10% of them will produce signals above the detection threshold. On the other hand if they form preferentially face-on this fraction increases up to 50%. Therefore it seems crucially important to determine the true distribution functions of these quantities observationally before making any predictions regarding the number of detections. \n \n 2. We show that there exists a strong correlation between the masses of the two components of a double white dwarf binary. As a result, the majority of systems detected by LISA will consist of nearly equal-mass objects. However, even though the average value of q is close to unity, there still exist many systems where the secondary component has significantly lower mass than its companion.

This construction allows us to define a metric tensor at each point as well as its inverse.

These extra degrees of freedom do not affect classical solutions because they correspond to gauge transformations.

We show how to build a setting of local coordinates for any chosen spacetime point such that all points with the same spatial values are connected by geodesics . This construction gives us to define a metric metric at each point as also as its dual . The total concept has essentially the same field equations as standard GR but it contains extra forms of freedom equivalent to the number of different components of the embedded system . These extra forms of freedom do not alter gauge solutions because they relate to gauge transformations . However , we suggest that these novel areas of freedom could play an essential role when considering quantum effects . In specifically , we discuss alternative implications of our method for black hole entropy calculations . Finally , we comment on some common problems concerning to this project .",

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space.

Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

The author considers the possibility that there are five dimensions of space (four ordinary spatial dimensions plus one extra temporal dimension) which could explain some of the observed properties of matter such as entropy production and irreversibility.   In particular he shows how the existence of these additional dimensions would lead to a violation of the principle of entropy increase with time, and suggests that this might provide a possible explanation for the arrow of time. This article is available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403070v1. Introduction:  Time has always been considered by physicists as being fundamentally different from other quantities like position or velocity because it cannot be measured directly but only inferred indirectly through its effects on other measurable quantities.  However, recent developments in theoretical physics suggest that we should consider whether the concept of time itself needs to be modified so that it becomes more closely related to other fundamental concepts such as mass, charge and energy.  For example, string theory predicts that all particles are vibrating strings moving along a multidimensional space called  space-time   1  .    Another approach involves considering the possibility that time is not just another quantity but rather part of a larger structure known as spacetime  2  , where the latter consists of both space and time together  3  .  According to this viewpoint, time is no longer regarded as something separate from space; instead they are viewed as two aspects of the same thing  4  .\nIn fact, many modern theories of quantum gravity predict that the universe contains at least three large scale dimensions - namely length, width and height  5  - while also containing a fourth small-scale dimension  6  .",

The LOCV approach allows one to obtain accurate results for both fermions and bosons at low temperatures. We show that our equation of state agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations performed within the grand canonical ensemble. In particular we find good agreement between theory and experiment on the energy per particle of 4 He-4 He mixtures near the superfluid transition temperature T = Tc. Our results are also compared with those obtained using other theoretical approaches such as the virial expansion or the hypernetted chain approximation. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe equation of state plays an important role in many areas of physics ranging from nuclear matter  1  , quantum gases  2  , astrophysics  3  , condensed matter  4  , etc.. It describes how various thermodynamic quantities depend on each other under given conditions.

In particular we consider two types of diagrams: (i) ladder-like diagrams corresponding to the exchange of gluons between pairs of strings, (ii) cross-ladder like-diagrams describing interactions among three or more strings. The latter type of diagrams can be interpreted as representing junctions where several strings meet at one point. We discuss some properties of these models and compare them with previous results obtained within the framework of Abelian-Higgs model. Finally, we study numerically the evolution of an initial configuration consisting of a single straight string into a complicated tangle of interacting strings using Monte Carlo simulations.

The SP field distribution and its decay length are calculated using the Green s function method for different values of the groove depth hg and width wg. It is found that when the groove depth increases to a certain value, the SP field decays exponentially along both directions away from the groove center instead of being confined within the groove region as before. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the SP mode becomes leaky once it scatters into radiation modes through the groove aperture. We also find that there exists another critical groove depth beyond which no SP field can exist inside or outside the groove due to total internal reflection between the groove walls. These results provide useful information on how to design efficient plasmonic devices based on grooves.",

Abstract : We research the scattering features of surface plasmons ( SPs ) by a single subwavelength groove in an optically long metal film , which is excited by a previously directed plane wave with circular polarization . The SP field distribution and its decay depth are calculated using the Green s function method for different values of the groove depth hg and depth wg . It is found that when the groove depth exceeds to a specified value , the SP field decays exponentially along both directions away from the groove area rather of being restricted within the groove region as before . This feature can be described by the fact that the SP field becomes leaky once it scatters into radiation modes through the groove opening . We also prove that there exists another key groove depth beyond which no SP field can exist inside or outside the groove due to total internal reflection between the groove walls . These results give useful information on how to create effective plasmonic devices using on grooves .",

We show that this method can be used for testing various models of dark energy by using only two parameters (the present-day values of Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q0). The proposed method does not require any additional information about the universe beyond what we already know today. This makes it possible to perform an independent check on the results obtained with other methods such as supernovae Ia observations or cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements. In particular, our analysis shows that the current data are consistent with the standard ΛCDM model at 1σ level but do not rule out some alternative models like quintessence or phantom fields. Finally, we discuss how future surveys could improve the constraints on these models.

The experiments are performed in a microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). We find that, for sufficiently large pulling speeds, the relaxation process can be described as a succession of three stages. In stage I, the contact angle decreases rapidly to its equilibrium value at which point the contact line stops moving. Stage II starts when the contact line has stopped moving; during this stage, the contact angle remains constant while the height profile of the free surface continues evolving towards its final shape. Finally, in stage III, the contact angle increases again until it reaches its initial value. This behavior is explained using a simple model based on lubrication theory. Our analysis shows that the relaxation time scales with the inverse of the pulling speed. For small pulling speeds, we observe deviations from our theoretical predictions due to inertial effects. \n \n Liquid films play important roles in many natural phenomena such as rain drops falling down a window or water evaporating into air.

In this work we consider an application of the distance geometry problem to music analysis and propose a novel method for automatic transcription of musical scores into symbolic representations based on the concept of pitch class profiles (PCP). The proposed approach allows us to recover the underlying harmonic structure of polyphonic music by solving a system of quadratic equations with linear equality constraints using convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our algorithm s performance on several classical piano pieces. 1 Introduction\n\nMusic Analysis\nAutomatic transcription of musical scores has been one of the most challenging problems in computer science over the past decades. It consists of recovering the underlying harmonic structure of a piece of music from its audio signal or MIDI file. This task can be divided into two main subtasks:  detection of note onset times; estimation of pitches at detected notes  locations. Note onset time detection is usually performed by applying various heuristics to the raw audio data  22, 23  . Once the note onset times have been determined, the next step is to estimate the pitches corresponding to these events. There exist many different approaches to solve this problem ranging from simple template matching methods to more sophisticated statistical models  7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19-21, 24-26  .\nIn this work we focus on the second part of the problem -estimation of pitches-which is known as  pitch estimation  or  pitch tracking . Pitch tracking algorithms try to assign a pitch value to every detected event in order to obtain a sequence of pitch values which correspond to the original score. A common way to represent pitches is through so-called pitch-class profiles (PCPs)  6, 12, 15, 18, 27  , where each entry corresponds to the number of occurrences of a particular pitch within a certain window around the current time instant.

The main sources of error include limb darkening effect, gravity brightening effect, and rotational distortion effect. These effects depend strongly on the spectral type of observed stars. For example, we find that the rotationally distorted shape of late-type giant stars may lead to an apparent shift of up to several mas between their positions measured at different epochs. This is comparable or even larger than the accuracy goal set for Gaia mission. Therefore it will be necessary to take into account these effects when analyzing data obtained by future space missions.

We find that there is no significant difference between the distributions for satellites with different luminosities or colors and those found around central cluster galaxies. The observed anisotropies are consistent with predictions based on tidal forces acting during galaxy mergers.

However, it remains unclear how this process occurs over time-scales ranging from individual galaxy interactions to the assembly of massive clusters containing hundreds of member galaxies.

However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio",

The basic idea is that one considers the Feynman path integral over all fields on spacetime as an infinite dimensional functional integration which can then be regularized by replacing the space of fields by a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a suitable norm.

The ignition delay times for both fuels increase as temperature increases due to an increased rate of chemical reactions. At low temperatures below 600 K, CP has longer ignition delays than CH because it is more difficult for the fuel molecules to overcome their activation energy barrier. However, above 700 K, the opposite trend occurs where CH exhibits longer ignition delays compared to CP. This can be explained by the fact that the higher molecular weight of CH leads to slower diffusion rates which results in lower reactivity.  In addition, the effect of equivalence ratio on the ignition delay time was also studied.

The search problem can be described by using Grover s method and its derivatives to seek one or more solutions among numerous possibilities . We show how this method can be used to problem problems such as finding a specified molecule within a large compound compound complex . Our results prove that it could be useful to using quantum techniques to rapid finds on later quantum machine computers . Quantum computing has been proposed as a modern paradigm for solving computational problems with users including from chemistry to optimization theory 1 - 3 . In contrast to traditional computers , where data is represented by packets ( 0s or 1s ) , quantum computers store information in qubits , which can play any superposition of 0s and 1s 4 . This feature allows quantum computers to perform different computations exponentially faster than their traditional counterparts 5 . In g to draw useful using of these advantages , yet , we need effective ways to implement quantum techniques 6 , including those using on Grover s method 7 - 9 . Here , we suggest a method for identifying unambiguously a single solution out of multiple possibilities 10 . As an example application , our technique could be used to recognize a distinct molecule within a larger compound compound block 11 .",

This work was supported by the European Commission under contract IST-2001-34011 Quantum Photonics (QAP). It has been performed within the framework of the EUROTOP network of excellence. A new approach towards realizing strongly interacting light-matter systems is proposed based on trapping ultracold atoms near high-finesse mirrors.

The results show that there is an attractive interaction between these membranes, which can be explained as follows. When one membrane approaches another with opposite charges on their surfaces, it will induce a dipole moment in its neighbor due to charge redistribution at the interface. This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases.

We show that the number density of Hagedorn strings is proportional to the free energy density of the thermal gas of massless particles in the dual field theory. This result implies that the entropy density of the thermal gas agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density of black holes in AdS(3). In addition we find that the pressure of the thermal gas agrees exactly with the negative cosmological constant in AdS(3), which corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton field in the dual conformal field theory. These results are consistent with the holographic principle proposed recently for strongly coupled gauge theories.

The latter determines the universality class of the transition as well as the temperature dependence of various physical quantities such as specific heat or resistivity.

The method is based on wavelet transforms in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). It allows us to separate different types of variability into their individual components at each point in time. We find that there are two distinct modes of solar magnetic field evolution over this period. One mode shows strong fluctuations around a mean value which varies slowly but significantly during the cycle 23/24 minimum. This behaviour can be explained as being due to the presence of large-scale dynamo waves driven by differential rotation. In addition we identify another type of variation which appears to have no preferred frequency or spatial scale.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Information-Based Asset Pricing .\nAbstract:\nThe information-based asset pricing model is an extension to the traditional CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) that incorporates additional factors into its analysis.  The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.   The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.   The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.    This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.  It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.  In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.  For example, suppose we have a hypothetical investor who holds a portfolio consisting of 50% U.S. Treasury bills and 50% Standard & Poor’s 500 Index Funds.

The first factor , market risk premium , means the excess return participants demand for holding key assets over and above their returns on lowest - key assets such as Treasury notes or bonds . The second factor , size factor , captures differences in expected returns between small - stock companies and large - stock returns . The third factor , value factor , estimates the difference in returns between large book - to - store value companies and low book - to - counter volume companies ; this factor has been shown to be especially useful during periods when interest values are falling . This section offers a short overview of these three factors along with some details of how they can influence financial decisions . The Capital Assets Pricing Model ( CAPM ) , introduced by Sharpe ( 1964 ) , Lintner ( 1965 ) , Mossin ( 1966 ) , and Black ( 1972 ) , is one of the most common used models in accounting today . It states that the expected rate of return on any specified security should equal the sum of two components - the harm - neutral rate plus a cost premium connected with the level of systematic danger involved in each security . In other words , if you hold a fund comprised only of cost - bound securities then your expected return will simply be the hazard - neutral rate ; whereas , if you hold a diversified fund containing both bad and un - bad securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the addition of danger you took on . For example , suppose we have a hypothetical buyer who possesses a fund comprised of 50 % U . S . Treasury notes and 50 % Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index Funds . If the total value on 10 - year Treasuries is 5 % per year while the S & P 500 Index earns 10 % annually , . . .",

We find that the fraction of cool core clusters is higher than expected for their redshifts based on local samples. The observed evolution may be due to an increase in the number density of active galactic nuclei or AGN activity over time. In addition, we detect extended emission line regions around some of these clusters which have been previously identified as having strong cooling flows. These results suggest that there has been significant heating of the intracluster medium by energetic outflows associated with AGNs since z = 1.0. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-9998. Cooling flow clusters are known to contain large amounts of cold gas within their central regions. However, it remains unclear how this gas cools down without forming stars. Recent studies show that many of them also harbor powerful radio sources near their centers.

We find that the portion of cool cluster regions is higher than expected for their redshifts according on surface data . The seen evolve could be due to an increase in the number density of active galactic nuclei or AGN activity over time . In addition , we obtain extended emission line regions around some of these regions which have been previously described as having strong cooling currents . These results suggest that there has been considerable heating of the intracluster system by energetic outflows involved with AGNs since z = 1 . 0 . This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5 - 9998 . Cooling flow clouds are found to carry large loads of cool gas within their main regions . However , it continues unknown how this gas cools down without creating stars . Recent research show that numerous of them also harbor potent radio signals near their sites . It is could that such radio systems hot up the ICM through shocks and / or turbulence generated during the interaction between the hot flow and the ambient hot gas .",

The first hypothesis suggests that larger animals need to process more information about their environment;  the second hypothesis suggests that larger animals require better coordination among different parts of their bodies.  Here we use data on the sizes of the brains and bodies of mammals ranging in size from mice to elephants to test these hypotheses against each other.  We find evidence supporting both hypotheses simultaneously - larger animals do indeed need to process more information, but they also need to coordinate activity across multiple regions of their bodies with greater precision.

For example , sparseness constraint was introduced into L AN so that only small portion of neurons are active simultaneously 9 . However , these techniques require supervised learning techniques to learn parameters of L AN , which keeps their users limited 10 .",

Finally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of ion trapping does not significantly affect the growth rates or saturation levels of the dominant electrostatic Langmuir waves.

We show that these perturbations can be decomposed into two parts: one is associated with the background geometry while another is related to the perturbation itself. In particular, we find that for any given background solution there exists an infinite number of solutions corresponding to different values of the conserved quantity. This implies that the conservation laws are not preserved under small perturbations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this effect may lead to violations of the weak equivalence principle. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for cosmology and black hole physics.

It lies between the photosphere and corona, and plays a crucial role in energy transport into the upper atmosphere. However, due to its extremely low density, direct observation of the chromosphere was not possible until recently when high-resolution images were obtained by space-based telescopes such as Hinode/SOT and SDO/AIA. In addition, ground-based observatories have also made significant progress towards studying the chromosphere through various techniques including spectropolarimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and speckle interferometry. Despite these advances, there are still many open questions about the physical processes occurring within the chromosphere which need to be addressed. For example, what causes the formation of dynamic structures like sunspots? How do magnetic fields affect plasma dynamics in the chromosphere? What is the relationship between chromospheric heating mechanisms and coronal mass ejections? These questions cannot be answered without detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the chromosphere. To address them we require new observational data at higher spatial resolutions than ever before.",

Enhancer activity is often cell-type specific and regulated by the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, how TFs cooperate to regulate enhancer function remains poorly understood. Here we show that cooperative interactions between two distinct classes of TFs play an important role in regulating enhancer activity during lytic infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a large double-stranded DNA virus. We find that HSV-1 encodes three proteins - VP16, ICP4 and ICP27 - each containing multiple domains capable of interacting directly or indirectly with other cellular proteins. Using biophysical methods, we demonstrate that these three viral proteins interact cooperatively on a single promoter element to drive expression of genes required for efficient viral replication.

The method is based on the use of a trial wave function that incorporates information about the broken bonds and their associated energy penalty, which are determined by exact diagonalization or density-functional theory calculations. We demonstrate our approach to calculate the electronic structure of silicon clusters Si_(n) with n = 2-10 atoms at zero temperature. Our results show good agreement with previous theoretical studies as well as experimental data obtained from photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. In addition we study the structural stability of these clusters against dissociation into smaller fragments. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of this work towards larger cluster sizes and finite temperatures. Quantum Monte Carlo methods have been widely used over recent years to solve many-body problems in condensed matter physics  1  .

Abstract : We show an method for the calculation of ground - level values in fermionic systems using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo ( AFQMC ) . The method is made on the using of a small wave model that combines information about the broken bonds and their involved energy penalty , which are determined by precise diagonalization or density - wave theoretical calculations . We prove our method to estimate the internal stability of digital groups Si _ ( n ) with weight = 2 - 10 molecules at zero cooling .

The explosion is triggered by the merger of the components due to gravitational wave emission.

This scenario may explain why there seems to exist a gap between the masses of ordinary core-collapse supernovae and those of GRBs.

We use the rotation curve derived by Clemens (1985) , which is based on 21-cm line observations of nearby spiral galaxies. The total mass enclosed within a radius R can be written as: M(R) = Vrot2πGRL + MDW(R), where Vrot is the circular velocity at galactocentric distance R, G is Newton s constant, L is the luminosity density, and MDW(R) is the contribution due to the dark matter halo. In this work we assume that the dark matter follows a Navarro-Frenk-White profile.  Using the rotation curve for the solar neighbourhood given by Clemens (1985) (V⊙ = 220 km/sec), we find that the best-fit parameters are L0 = 0.0013 Msun/pc3 and r0 = 1 kpc. This implies that the local surface brightness ΣL = L/L0 = 3.6 × 10^−26 W/m2/Hz/sr.

In particular, there was a factor of 3 increase in the hard band count rate over about 20 ks followed by a slower decay back towards the initial level.

We show that this model can be used to describe many real-world systems such as metabolic pathways in yeast cells or social interactions between individuals in animal groups. In particular we find that: (i) The number of links per node scales linearly with system size. (ii) The clustering coefficient decreases logarithmically with system size. (iii) The average path length increases logarithmically with system size. These results agree well with those observed for both metabolic networks and social networks. Finally, by using our evolutionary approach, we predict new functional relationships among genes in the yeast cell cycle pathway. Complex networks have been found to play important roles in various fields ranging from physics  1  , biology  2  , sociology  3  , computer science  4  , etc.. Many real world networks exhibit common statistical properties including power-law degree distribution  5  , small diameter  6  , high clustering coefficients  7, 8  .

This issue has been studied extensively within the framework of linearized gravity theory  2  , where GWs are treated as small perturbations of flat Minkowski background geometry  3  .\nIn this work we focus on the effects due to gravitational self-coupling  4  .

We find that there are three types of collective modes: one is gapless and has linear dispersion relation at small wave vector; another is gapped but still has quadratic dispersion relation near the Fermi surface; while the third type is fully gapped without any low-energy excitations. The latter two types can be regarded as phonon-like collective modes. In addition to these three types of collective modes, we also find an exotic mode which does not exist in single-gap systems. This new mode originates from the interband pairing interaction between electrons on different bands. It shows up only when both intraband and interband interactions are present simultaneously. Our results show that this new mode may have important effects on the transport properties of multi-band superconductors. \n \n Introduction \n \n Multi-band superconductivity attracts much attention recently because it occurs naturally in many materials such as MgB_2  1  , Sr 2 RuO 4  2  , FeSe  3  .

The camera consists of 960 photomultiplier tubes arranged on a hexagonal grid covering a field-of-view of 3 degrees diameter. It has been taking data since March 2009. In this work we present results obtained by applying different analysis techniques to the first two years of data taken with the TACTIC telescope. We show that these analyses are able to reconstruct events with high efficiency over most of the energy range covered by the instrument. Finally, we compare our results with those published by other experiments operating in similar energy ranges. This article is part of the themed issue  The Universe as seen by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes . Gamma-rays can be detected indirectly via their interaction with Earth s atmosphere, producing showers of secondary particles which emit light when they reach the ground level. These so-called air-shower photons can then be observed using large optical detectors such as imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). IACTs have proven to be powerful instruments for studying cosmic phenomena like active galactic nuclei or supernova remnants. However, due to their relatively small fields-of-view, they usually require several hours of observation time per source before significant detection significances can be achieved. To overcome this problem, new generation IACT arrays were built recently, consisting of multiple telescopes distributed across wide areas. One example is the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)  1  , where four telescopes observe simultaneously the same region of the sky.

We find that this process is likely to occur in most cases where stars are formed within clusters containing massive stars (>8 Msun). In these environments, we estimate that about half of all solar-type stars will be enriched by at least one supernova event during their disk lifetimes. This result has important consequences on our understanding of how planets form around metal-rich stars. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets orbiting metal-rich stars suggests that planet formation may be more efficient when the host star s metallicity is high. However, it remains unclear whether such planets can also form around low-mass stars like the Sun. Recent theoretical studies suggest that planetesimal accretion onto growing planetary embryos could be inhibited if the gas surrounding them contains too much dust or ice particles produced by collisions between larger bodies. If so, then the efficiency of core growth would decrease as the amount of solids increases beyond some critical value.",

We consider the uplink scenario where each user transmits to its base station using an orthogonal spreading sequence and all users share the same frequency band. The objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual quality-of-service constraints at each user s receiver. In order to obtain tractable results, we make use of tools from stochastic geometry which allow us to model the locations of both mobiles and interferers as point processes. Our main contributions are summarized below.  First, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability when the number of active users grows without bound. These expressions can be used to determine how many users can simultaneously communicate reliably over the network. Second, we propose distributed power control schemes that achieve these limits asymptotically under certain conditions. Third, we develop centralized power control algorithms that guarantee performance close to optimality even if only partial information about the channel gains or interference levels is available.

Title : Power management techniques for CDMA networks built on large system analysis . Abstract : In this dissertation , we research power management problems in cell wireless radio systems with code division multiple access ( CDMA ) . We consider the uplink scenario where each user transmits to its home station using an orthogonal transmission pattern and all users share the same transmission zone . The aim is to avoid the total broadcasting power subject to individual level - of - service requirements at each user s receiver . In attempt to obtain tractable results , we need using of tools from stochastic geometry which enable us to model the sites of both mobiles and interferers as model mechanisms . Our main contributions are summarized below. First , we obtain shut - type statements for the outage probability when the number of active users expands without bound . These statements can be used to decide how numerous users can jointly communicate reliably over the system . Second , we suggest distributed electricity management schemes that achieve these limits asymptotically under specified circumstances . Third , we develop centralized power management techniques that ensure performance close to optimality albeit if only partial information about the channel gains or interference profiles is produced .

Volborthite has been studied extensively by neutron scattering experiments but its microscopic origin remains controversial.

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system.

We show how these objects can be explained by the merger of two helium white dwarfs with total mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.   The resulting merged object is expected to have a radius larger than its Roche lobe at all stages during the merging process, which leads to stable mass transfer onto the companion star until it fills its Roche lobe and starts overflowing.   This results in a common envelope phase where most of the orbital energy released is used to eject the outer layers of both stars into space.   After this stage, the system consists of a naked helium core surrounded by a thin hydrogen layer on top of the helium core.   If the initial masses of the progenitor white dwarf components were close enough together such that their cores merge before they reach the Chandrasekhar mass, then we expect the final product to resemble a normal sdB star; if not, then the final product will be more massive than the Chandrasekhar",

The assessment is conducted within an effective field theoretical perspective , where we using chiral perturbation sheet to explain the interaction between pions and nucleons up to next - to - leading rank . We then include vector - meson forms of freedom through the hidden gauge formalism . In specifically , we consider contributions come from one - loop diagrams concerning rho mesons as good as path - level mechanisms mediated by rho mesons . Our theoretical formulation enable us to research both neutral charge reactions such as elastic ep diffusion or charged charge reactions like single - pion production off protons . Using this model , we are could to obtain experimental data for all these observables concurrently . Finally , we discuss how our findings can be used to obtain information about the things of the rho meson . This effort was backed by the U . S . Department of Energy under Contract No .

We found that all these sources show strong Fe K emission lines and their line widths are broader than those expected from thermal broadening at kT = 100 keV. The observed line profiles can be reproduced well by relativistic disk reflection models including Compton scattering effects. These results suggest that there is an additional component to the X-ray continuum other than the standard thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes. In addition, we find that the iron abundance relative to solar value is higher than 1.5 times in three out of four objects. This suggests that the central engines of these obscured AGNs may have been buried under heavy dusty torii.

We find that loops with different temperatures have similar distributions of widths, which are well fitted by log-normal functions. The mean values of these distributions increase with temperature as expected for pressure equilibrium between plasma confined within magnetic structures and their surroundings. However, we also find that there is no significant difference between the widths measured along individual loops and those determined from averaged profiles over entire active regions. This suggests that the apparent constancy of loop widths may be due to averaging effects rather than being intrinsic properties of coronal structures.

The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 . Even today there exist many open questions about black holes  4  . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",

The results show that all four bases are adsorbed on the surface with different binding energies ranging between -0.27 eV for adenine to -1.10 eV for cytosine. In addition, it was found that the adsorption energy decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This indicates that the interaction strength depends strongly on the electronegativity of the base molecules. It has been shown that the most stable configuration corresponds to an end-on orientation where the carbonyl oxygen atom interacts directly with one of the C-C bonds of the graphene sheet. \n \n Keywords: Physisorption; Graphene; Nucleobase; Density Functional Theory Calculations. Introduction \n \n Graphene is a two-dimensional material consisting of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice structure  1  . Due to its unique electronic properties such as high carrier mobility  2  , large specific surface area  3  , thermal conductivity  4  , mechanical flexibility  5  , chemical stability  6  and biocompatibility  7, 8  , this material has attracted considerable attention over recent years  9  . However, despite these advantages, there have been some challenges associated with the use of pristine graphene sheets due to their hydrophobic nature  10  which limits their applications  11  . Therefore, many efforts have been made towards modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of graphene through various approaches including covalent  12  or non-covalent  13  functionalization  14  .\n \nIn particular, non-covalent functionalization can be achieved via π-π interactions  15  , hydrogen bonding  16  , electrostatic  17  , van der Waals  18  and ionic  19  forces  20  .

Abstract : The physisorption of nucleobases ( adenine , cytosine , guanine and thymine ) onto graphene is determined by density factor theoretical calculations at the B3LYP / 6 - 31G ( d ) level in vacuum environments . The results show that all four sites are adsorbed on the surface with different binding energies spectrum between - 0 . 27 eV for adenine to - 1 . 10 eV for cytosine . In addition , it was found that the adsorption efficiency falls as the number of nitrogen molecules increases . This shows that the interaction intensity depends strongly on the electronegativity of the ground molecules . It has been shown that the most effective configuration refers to an ending - on alignment where the carbonyl atom atom interacts directly with one of the C - C bonds of the graphene sheet . Keywords: Physisorption; Graphene; Nucleobase; Density Functional Theory Calculations. Introduction Graphene is a two - connected solid composed of sp2 - hybridized carbon molecules arranged into a honeycomb molecular pattern 1 . Due to its distinctive internal structures such as long electron density 2 , large restricted surface area 3 , thermal conductivity 4 , mechanical flexibility 5 , molecular stability 6 and biocompatibility 7 , 8 , this product has attracted considerable interest over subsequent ages 9 . However , despite these advantages , there have been some challenges involved with the using of pristine graphene blankets due to their hydrophobic behavior 10 which limits their performance 11 . Therefore , numerous efforts have been made towards modifying the physical and molecular traits of graphene through numerous approaches including covalent 12 or non - covalent 13 functionalization 14 . In specifically , non - covalent functionalization can be achieved via π - π interactions 15 , ion bonding 16 , electrostatic 17 , van van Waals 18 and ionic 19 interactions 20 . Among them, π-π stacking is considered to be the strongest noncovalent force  21  .

We show that this system can be mapped onto an effective Heisenberg model in terms of classical spins residing at the centers of hexagons formed by nearest-neighbor bonds. The ground state phase diagram consists of three phases: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and canted AFM states. In particular, we find that the FM order survives even when the distortion is strong enough to destroy it completely without spatial anisotropy. This result suggests that the magnetic properties of volborthite are governed not only by the interlayer coupling but also by the intralayer one. Furthermore, we discuss possible origins of the observed magnetization plateau in volborthite. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe distorted kagome lattice has attracted much attention recently because its structure is realized in several materials such as volborthite  1  , kapellasite  2  , herbertsmithite  3  , vesignieite  4  . These compounds have been studied extensively both experimentally  5  -  8  and theoretically  9  -  11  .\nIn particular, volborthite shows rich physical phenomena including a magnetization plateau around 1/3 of saturation magnetization M s  12 -  14  . It was suggested that these features originate from the presence of the distorted kagome layers  15  . However, there still remain many open questions about the microscopic mechanism behind them  16  . For example, what kind of interaction plays a crucial role? Is the distortion necessary or not?\nTo answer these questions, it would be useful to investigate the effect of the distortion systematically using theoretical methods  17  . Although some studies have already been done  18  -  20  , they were limited to small clusters and/or weak distortion cases. Therefore, it remains unclear how the distortion affects the magnetic properties of the distorted kagomé layer.\nIn this work, we study quantum spin-1/2 models with spatially anisotropic exchanges on the distorted kagomé lattice  see Figs. 1(",

In particular we find that the presence of noise enhances the amplitude of oscillations in both cases but with very different mechanisms.

We show how to use statistical mechanics methods to analyze the functional properties of this system as it evolves over time through its underlying structural connectivity. In particular we focus on the role played by switches which are nodes with high degree centrality whose removal disconnects large portions of the network. Our results suggest that these switches play important roles in maintaining global dynamical stability while allowing for local flexibility. The manuscript is organized into four sections. Section I introduces our model and describes some basic features of the resulting networks. Section II presents numerical simulations showing how switching affects the evolution of the system. Section III analyzes the effect of removing switches on the networks  ability to maintain synchrony under perturbations. Finally section IV discusses possible extensions of our work.

Binary Evolution in Collisional Nuclei .\nAbstract:\nWe present the results of long-term numerical simulations of binary black hole (BBH) evolution, including gravitational radiation reaction and general relativistic effects such as frame dragging and tidal disruption. We focus on binaries with total mass M = 100-1000M⊙ that evolve through collisional nuclear environments at high redshifts z > 10. Our main goal is to study how BBHs can grow by accretion during their early stages of evolution when they are surrounded by dense gas clouds. In particular we investigate whether these systems can reach masses above 1000M⊙ before merging within a Hubble time. The initial conditions for our models were obtained using Monte Carlo sampling of the distribution function of isolated BBHs constructed by Belczynski et al. (2010) . For each model we performed several runs starting from different orbital configurations. All calculations were carried out assuming circular orbits. We find that most of the massive binaries merge within a few hundred million years after formation due to emission of gravitational waves. However, some of them survive until today if they form in regions where the density of surrounding gas exceeds $10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$.

It should be noted that our calculations were conducted without any extra approximations beyond those used in previous research using on the EOM formalism 19 - 21 . The achieved numerical results prove that , at small values T < 10 K , the main emission to spin diffusion depends from co - flipping diffusion with acoustic - phonon modes 22 . At higher regions , therefore , other mechanisms become more large giving to higher spiral relaxation periods . Our theoretical predictions comply decent good with previous experimental data on QD ensembles 23 . Finally , it was shown that the inclusion of exchange interactions between electrons gives to an enhancement of the electron absorption rate as addition as to a reduction in its thermal dependence 24 .",

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) allow us to measure galaxy orientations accurately enough to perform such analyses. For example, Lee et al. (2008) used SDSS DR4 data to investigate the alignments between galaxy spin vectors and their nearest neighbor s position angles. They found no",

We learn that galaxies are preferentially arranged opposite to their local tidal field on sizes larger than 1 Mpc / h . This alignment is stronger for more large galaxies at higher redshifts . The seen spiral - tide correlation can be described by the influence of gravitational torques exerted by large - complex structures during the formed cycle of these galaxies .

These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular orbit as also as for interpreting observations of cosmic stress statistics . Introduction : Galaxies create within overdense regions of the world where they experience heavy gravitational interactions with other structures such as adjacent galaxies or groups of galaxies .

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  High-harmonic generation in diatomic molecules: a quantum-orbit analysis of the interference patterns .\nAbstract:\nWe present an analytical model for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in diatomic molecules, which is based on the concept of molecular orbitals and their associated electronic wavefunctions. The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years  1, 2  . It provides access to extreme ultraviolet radiation  3  , which enables novel applications such as attosecond pulse generation  4  , photoelectron spectroscopy  5  , and tomography  6  .\nThe underlying physical mechanism behind HHG was first explained within the semiclassical three-step model  7, 8  : An electron tunnels out of its atomic core into the continuum upon interaction with the electric field of the laser light. Afterwards it propagates freely before being driven back towards the nucleus by the same field. Finally, it recombines with the parent ion emitting a photon whose energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy lost due to tunneling  9  . Since then, several extensions have been developed  10  including the so-called quantum-orbit theory  11  , which takes into account the influence of the nuclear potential on the electron dynamics  12  . However, despite all efforts made so far, there still exist many open questions regarding the microscopic origin of HHG  13  .",

We find that this phase is mainly due to the continuous energy injection into the forward shock driven by the expanding bubble formed at the head of the jet. The injected energy comes from the kinetic energy of the swept-up shell material as well as the thermal energy of shocked ambient gas inside the bubble.

It was found that most GRBs have their prompt emissions followed by a relatively smooth power-law decline lasting several hundred seconds known as the  afterglow  phase (Costa et al. 1997; van Paradijs et al. 1997) . This phase can be explained by synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated behind the blast wave generated when the ejecta hits the circumburst medium (Sari et al. 1998 ). However, some GRB afterglows exhibit a shallower-than-power law decline during hundreds of seconds before entering the normal afterglow phase (e.g., Panaitescu & Kumar 2001; Nousek et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2007; Willingale et al. 2007) , which cannot be explained within the standard fireball model. Several models were proposed to explain these phenomena, including late-time central engine activity (Zhang 2007b ), refreshed-shock scenario (Ghisellini et al. 2007 ) and reverse shock emission (Kobayashi 2000; Kobayashi & Sari 2001) .

Abstract : We give the results of our numerical simulations on the shallow - decay cycle of GRB X - ray faint curves , which are produced by the interaction between an ultra - relativistic wave and its surrounding medium in the context of the internal shock model for GRBs . We say that this cycle is partially due to the continuous force flow into the front shock generated by the expanding bubble formed at the top of the aircraft .

The flow is forced at large scales by adding to the momentum equation an external force that has zero mean but whose Fourier transform contains both positive and negative wavenumbers. We find that this type of forcing excites two distinct types of modes in the system: vortical and wave-like modes. Vortical modes are characterized by strong vertical motions concentrated near the center of the domain; they have low horizontal velocities and their kinetic energy decays rapidly as we move away from the center. On the other hand, wave-like modes are characterized by weak vertical motions distributed over larger regions of space; they have high horizontal velocities and their kinetic energies decay slowly or even increase slightly when moving away from the center. In addition, these waves can be either stationary or propagating horizontally depending on whether the forcing spectrum peaks at small or large horizontal wavenumber respectively.",

This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres.

In our model, quasars are assumed to be located at peaks of dark matter density fluctuations and ionize surrounding gas with an anisotropic Strömgren sphere whose shape is determined by the local tidal field. By performing numerical simulations for different values of the spin temperature T S , we find that the 21-cm PS has a characteristic peak structure which reflects the shapes of individual H II regions. This peak structure becomes more prominent as T S decreases because the number of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the decrease in the brightness temperature difference between the CMB and the 21-cm emission line. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use this peak structure to constrain the value of T S . However, since there exist many other factors affecting the 21-cm PS besides T S , further studies will be needed before drawing any conclusions on its detectability.",

It is well known that this property arises due to destructive interference between different pathways leading to emission of photons  4  .\nRecently, several authors studied the effects of spontaneous emission on the second-order correlation functions  5  -  8  . They showed that the presence of spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics  6 - 8  .

We show how to derive this model starting from first principles, and we discuss some of its main properties. In particular, we find that at half-filling it exhibits two different phases depending on the strength of the Coulomb interaction between electrons. For weak coupling these are separated by a phase transition driven by spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry; for strong coupling they correspond respectively to a conventional QHE state and to a novel fractionalized topological insulator characterized by chiral edge states.

Keywords: Central Limit Theorem; Elliptical Distributions; Regression Modeling. 1 Introduction In many applications it is assumed that the response variable follows a Gaussian distribution while the predictors may or may not be normally distributed. For example, this assumption has been used extensively in econometrics (see e.g., Greene  2003  ). However, there are situations where the data generating process does not satisfy such assumptions. This motivates us to consider more general classes of distributions which include as special cases both the normal and nonnormal distributions. One class of distributions that includes most common probability density functions encountered in practice is given by the so-called elliptical distributions.

First , a proton - exchange ( PE ) process 4 was conducted to expand a single - type ridge - waveguide system inside the bulk LiNbO 3 crystal 5 . Then , a ring - resonator configuration was patterned into the PE - grown region via electron emission lithography 6 . Finally , titanium / gold ( Ti / Au ) layers were evaporated onto both faces of the sample to give electrical access to the device 7 , 8 .

The method is based on homogenization theory combined with finite element analysis (FEA) in order to account for local interactions between neighboring unit cells. We consider three types of unit cell geometries that can be used to model various composite materials such as: wire grid composites, fiber reinforced polymeric matrix composites, and metal foams. In particular we focus our attention on wire grid composites made up of periodically arranged parallel wires embedded into a homogeneous medium. For this type of structure it has been shown experimentally that the macroscopic elastic moduli depend strongly on the volume fraction occupied by the wires. However, these experimental results cannot be explained using classical homogenization theories because they do not take into account the interaction effects among adjacent wires. Therefore, we propose here a new theoretical framework to study the mechanical behavior of wire grid composites at both micro-and meso-scales.",

Our results show that EX Hya has returned to quiescence after its latest eruption in September 2002.

However, there remain many open questions about how this process takes place and what happens afterwards. One such question concerns the nature of the WD magnetic field. It is generally accepted that the WD magnetic field plays a key role in determining whether or not a system will undergo a thermonuclear runaway. If the WD magnetic field is too weak then no runaway occurs; if it is strong enough then the WD can become fully convective leading to stable hydrogen burning and hence preventing any further outburst activity. This picture is complicated however by the fact that some WDs do exhibit periodic outbursts despite having fields thought to be too weak to prevent them becoming fully convective. Such objects are called Intermediate Polars (IPs), where the WD magnetic field is sufficiently strong to synchronise the spin periods of both stars but does not disrupt the flow of matter onto the WD.",

Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation  11  which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system  12  . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states  13  .

We also show that this result can be used to derive an approximate expression for the stress energy tensor of the gravitational field. The results are applied to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during inflation driven by a scalar field with non-canonical kinetic term. In particular we find that the non-Gaussianity generated at second order in perturbation theory does not vanish even if the background geometry is exactly de Sitter space-time. This implies that the bispectrum produced by such models cannot be described solely in terms of local shape functions as it was previously thought. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest on higher derivative theories of gravity motivated mainly by their possible role in quantum gravity phenomenology (see e.g. ), but also because they provide interesting alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in the context of modified gravity scenarios . However, despite these efforts, our understanding of the physical consequences of these theories remains incomplete due to technical difficulties associated with the analysis of their solutions. One of the main obstacles comes from the fact that the equations of motion derived from these actions contain derivatives of arbitrarily high order, making them difficult or impossible to solve analytically. A way out of this problem consists in expanding the fields around some fixed background solution and truncating the resulting series expansion after a finite number of terms. Although this approach allows one to obtain useful information about the dynamics of the system under consideration, it fails to capture important features like back-reaction effects between different modes of the same field or interactions among different fields. For example, in the case of inflationary cosmologies based on higher derivative gravity, the truncated perturbative expansions do not reproduce correctly the observed level of primordial non-Gaussianities .\nA more systematic method to deal with these problems involves the use of covariant techniques developed originally within the framework of GR. These methods allow us to express the equations of motion in a manifestly gauge",

We show that the electron trajectories can be focused into narrow beams when their initial velocities have opposite directions along the field lines. This is due to an interference between two types of motion -the usual cyclotrons and the so-called  Zitterbewegung  oscillations-which leads to a beating pattern on top of the classical circular orbits. The latter type of motion arises because of the relativistic nature of the particles and its origin lies in the fact that the energy bands are spin split. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the physics behind phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect or the integer quantum Hall effect at high Landau levels. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of interacting fermions under strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been studied extensively over many years  1  . In particular, it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional filling factors  2  , where the number of filled Landau levels differs from the expected value  3  .\nIn this work we focus our attention on the case of non-interacting fermions moving in 2D space subject to a uniform magnetic field B = Be z  4  .

Title : Magnetic concentrating of charge carriers from magnetic - divided bands : Semiclassics of a Zitterbewegung force . Abstract : We explore the semiclassical dynamics of states in magnetic fields , which are described by the Dirac expression with magnetic - orbit interactions and Zeeman splitting . We show that the electron trajectories can be shifted into narrow beams when their first velocities have opposite directions along the field fields . This is due to an interference between two forms of movement - the normal cyclotrons and the so - called Zitterbewegung oscillations - which gives to a beating pattern on top of the traditional rotating orbits . The last type of move emerges because of the relativistic behavior of the interactions and its source depends in the fact that the energy bands are spin divided . Our results give a fresh perspective for understanding the science behind interactions such as the quantum Hall influence or the integer quantum Hall influence at high Landau concentrations . I . INTRODUCTIO N The diffusion behavior of two - level ( 2D ) systems of coupled fermions under bold magnetic magnetic fields have been studied much over numerous ages 1 . In specifically , it has been shown that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field gives rise to novel phases characterized by fractional solution factors 2 , where the number of filled Landau concentrations varies from the expected value 3 . In this research we emphasis our interest on the matter of anti - interference fermions move in 2D field subject to a consistent magnetic field B = Be z 4 . For simplicity , we consider only one spin species ; therefore , all our results stay useful if both spin models are took into account 5 . In addition , we suppose that the Fermi level falls within the conduction zone 6 .

Introduction: One of the most important open questions in particle physics today concerns the origin of fermion families and their mixing angles. It has been known since the work by Pati & Salam  1  , that if quarks and leptons were unified into larger multiplets then it would be possible to understand the pattern of quark-lepton masses and mixings within Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). However, despite many attempts over more than 30 years no realistic GUT has yet been constructed which incorporates all the features of the Standard Model (SM).\nIn recent years another possibility was suggested  2  -  4  : If the SM fields live in higher dimensional space-time, they may have Kaluza-Klein excitations corresponding to additional states with masses of order 1/R, where R denotes the size of the extra dimensions. These states might correspond to heavy particles beyond those present in the SM spectrum. This idea leads to interesting phenomenological consequences  5  .\nThe simplest way to realize this scenario is to assume that only gravity propagates in the bulk while the SM fields are confined to a four-dimensional  brane   6  .

We show that the formation rate of second stars is suppressed at redshifts z < 20 due to photoheating effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The suppression factor increases as redshift decreases because the IGM temperature rises more rapidly than its density. At lower redshifts, we find that the formation rates of both first and second stars increase sharply when the universe becomes reionized. This effect occurs because the ionizing photons produced during reionization heat up the surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms, thereby increasing their Jeans mass and suppressing fragmentation into smaller objects.

The governing equations for this problem are derived in terms of the total pressure perturbation inside the loop as well as its cross-sectional area variation along the loop length.

We find that the dependence is weak when the spins are aligned or antialigned but strong when they have an intermediate angle between them. The results suggest that it may be possible to measure the black hole s quadrupole moment by observing gravitational waves emitted during the late stages of inspiral.

The Carter constant is one of several constants of motion associated with geodesic orbits around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968). It can be used as a probe of the spacetime geometry close to the event horizon because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists significant deviation from spherical symmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986 ). For example, the presence of a massive accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter constant even though the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged (Kerr 1963). \n \n Previous studies have shown that the orbital evolution of binaries with non-spinning components is affected by the black-hole quadrupole moment Q = M(1 − S2)/c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999) . However, these effects become negligible once the black holes reach their final plunge phase due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, recent observations indicate that many galactic nuclei contain supermassive black holes whose masses range up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. (2000)). These objects are expected to evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such evolutionary processes, the black holes could acquire large amounts of angular momentum via tidal interactions and/or",

Title : development of the Carter coefficient for inspirals into a black hole : result of the black hole quadrupole . Abstract : We research how the evolve of the Carter number depends on the spin and weight balance in binary systems with spins black holes , using numerical relativity simulations .

The results suggest that it could be could to estimate the visual hole s quadrupole number by observing gravitational signals generated during the late phases of inspiral . This would create information about the spacetime dynamics near the fringe which cannot be achieved otherwise . Introduction In this research we investigate how the evolve of the so - called Carter number depends on the black - hole spin and weight - factor in binary systems including two spins black holes . The Carter number is one of numerous constants of movement connected with geodesic orbits around Kerr black spaces ( Carter 1968 ) . It can be used as a reference of the spacetime dynamics close to the earthquake bin because its value changes significantly over time only if there exists considerable deviation from symmetric stability at small radii ( Bardeen 1973 ; Thorne et l . 1986 ). For example , the presence of a large accretion disk will lead to a change in the Carter number even though the total angular value of the system continues unchanged ( Kerr 1963 ) . Previous research have shown that the kinetic behavior of binaries with un - spins components is affected by the hot - hole quadrupole value Q = M ( 1 − S2 ) / c2R2 where S denotes the dimensionless spin factor of each black hole ( Damour & Nagar 1999 ) . However , these impacts become negligible once the black spaces achieve their final plunge stage due to rapid orbital decay caused by emission of gravitational emission . On the other hand , latest observations suggest that numerous galactic assemblies include supermassive black spaces whose values limit up to 10 ^ 9 solar values ( example . g . , Gebhardt et l . (2000)). These components are expected to evolve through different phases of weight transition before reaching their final state of coalescence .

How do they form? What happens when two or more planets interact gravitationally? Are there other Earth-like worlds orbiting Sun-like stars within reachable distances?  Answering these questions requires detailed observations of individual planets, which can only be achieved by direct imaging techniques. Unfortunately, current ground-based observatories cannot achieve high enough angular resolution to resolve the majority of close-in planets due to atmospheric turbulence effects.   To overcome this limitation, NASA s Kepler satellite was launched in 2009 to search for transiting planets around bright stars. Although Kepler has been extremely successful, its primary focus is on detecting large planets in short orbits. It does not provide any information on the orbital inclination angle of detected planets, nor does it allow for precise measurements of planet radii and masses. Furthermore, because of its relatively small field-of-view, Kepler misses out on discoveries made outside of its target fields.",

We find that the Fermi surface topology changes dramatically across the metal-insulator boundary, with the appearance of new hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center. The calculated band gap agrees well with experiments on single crystals. In addition, we predict that there are two competing nematic phases near the metal-insulator boundary. One has in-plane anisotropy along the Ru-O-Ru bond direction while another one has out-of-plane anisotropy perpendicular to it. These results provide insights into the origin of the observed structural distortion in bilayer ruthenates. Bilayer ruthenates have attracted considerable attention recently due to their rich physical properties including unconventional superconductivity  1  , quantum criticality  2  , and multiferroicity  3  . Among these materials, Sr3Ru2O7 shows particularly interesting behavior because its ground state can be tuned continuously from metallic to insulating states through chemical doping or applying pressure  4  .\nIn recent years, several experimental studies have been performed to investigate the nature of the metal-insulator transition (MIT).

The experiments are performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. Our results confirm that volume entropy always increases with time as predicted by theory. This result also confirms that our measurement system works properly. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our approach.

We show that CRW models can reproduce many features observed in numerical simulations of reionization, including the power spectrum at large scales, as well as the characteristic shape of the cross-correlation between different redshifts. In addition to these results, we find that our model predicts a new feature which is not seen in previous work -the presence of large-scale correlations even after reionization has completed. This effect may be detectable with future radio telescopes such as SKA. The 21cm line emission from neutral hydrogen provides us with a unique probe into the early universe.

We use two methods to classify galaxies into four types: star-forming galaxies (SFG), active galactic nuclei host galaxies (AGNHG), early-type galaxies with emission lines (ETGEL) and early-type galaxies without emission lines (ETGSIL).\nThe first method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the optical spectra of all galaxies classified as spectroscopic targets by the SDSS pipeline. The second one uses the PCA applied only to the subset of galaxies that are morphologically selected for having bulges dominated by old stellar populations. In both cases we find that ETGs form a continuous sequence in terms of their spectral properties along which SFGs evolve towards ETGSILs through ETGELs. This evolutionary path can be described by a simple linear combination of three eigenvectors corresponding to the most prominent features seen in the mean spectrum of each type of galaxies.",

We using two techniques to classify galaxies into four categories : star - creating galaxies ( SFG ) , active galactic nuclei host galaxies ( AGNHG ) , upper - type interactions with emission bands ( ETGEL ) and upper - type interactions without emission poles ( ETGSIL ) . The first method is dependent on the principal component examination ( PCA ) applied to the optical spectra of all galaxies listed as spectroscopic targets by the SDSS pipeline . The second one using the PCA applied only to the subset of galaxies that are morphologically selected for having bulges dominated by former stellar communities . In both circumstances we prove that ETGs create a continuous pattern in terms of their spectral features along which SFGs evolve become ETGSILs through ETGELs . This evolved path can be described by a simple simple sum of three eigenvectors similar to the most prominent features seen in the overall spectrum of each type of galaxies .",

The observed dependence of EPC on both temperature and film thickness suggests that phonon confinement plays an important role in determining the strength of EPC in these materials.

One key question concerns whether or not these disks evolve into planetary systems like our own solar system. To answer such questions it will be necessary to study individual examples of young circumstellar disks as they evolve over time. However, because most young stars are deeply embedded within dense molecular clouds, direct observations of the inner regions of these disks are difficult. Fortunately, some young stars are surrounded by optically thin dusty envelopes that allow us to probe the physical conditions near the central object through scattered light. These so-called transitional disks show evidence of clearing out large amounts of material inside several AU of the central star while still retaining significant quantities of gas farther away (Strom et al., 1989; Skrutskie et al., 1990; Calvet et al., 2002; Muzerolle et al., 2003; Sicilia-Aguilar et al., 2006; Espaillat et al., 2007) . \n \n A number of studies suggest that the outer edges of transitional disks are sculpted by photoevaporative winds driven off the surface of the disk by intense ultraviolet radiation from nearby",

By fitting our theoretical model to measurements we are able to extract the slip length from the data. Our results agree very well with previous experiments performed under similar conditions.

Abstract : We research the bubbling solutions to type - IIB supergravity on anti - de Sitter field , which are dual to supersymmetric gauge schemes with eight supercharges . We show that these solutions can be described by two different forms of configurations : ( i ) as an asymptotically - AdS 5 × S 5 configuration with a small bubble connected at its tip ; or ( v ) as a collection of concentric cylindrical bubbles surrounding a inner region where the metric is locally AdS 5 . The last example arises when the number of colors Nc of the gauge field becomes large compared to the rank k of the gauge class .

In particular, our approach uses a new metric called  expected transmission count  in order to select routes with minimum expected number of transmissions per packet delivery. Furthermore, it employs a modified version of the well-known proportional fairness criterion as well as a utility function that takes into account both the current network conditions and user preferences.

We find that there is no correlation between these quantities in either pre-Swift or Swift bursts. This result contradicts previous claims that such correlations are evidence for physical origins of the correlations. The lack of any significant correlation suggests that the underlying physics driving the emission process may be more complicated than previously thought. In particular, we show that it is possible to produce simulated data sets with similar statistical properties as those observed without requiring any additional assumptions about the nature of the emission mechanism beyond what has already been established observationally. These results have important implications for future theoretical work attempting to explain the origin of gamma-ray burst prompt emission. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), intense flashes of gamma rays lasting only milliseconds, were discovered over thirty years ago but their exact cause remains unknown. One of the most puzzling aspects of this phenomenon is the apparent diversity among GRBs themselves; while some bursts exhibit smooth power-law spectra extending up to several hundred keV, others display complex features including multiple peaks and/or breaks in their energy distributions. Despite this variety, however, many studies have found that all GRBs share certain common characteristics which can be summarized into two main empirical relations known as the Amati relation and Ghirlanda relation. \n \n Both of these relations relate the peak photon flux at high energies (>100 MeV) to other observable quantities such as the total fluence emitted during the burst and its duration. While both relations appear to hold true statistically when applied to large samples of bursts, they do not necessarily reflect an intrinsic connection between the various observables involved. Indeed, recent observational campaigns have shown that the scatter around each relation increases significantly if one attempts to apply them to individual bursts rather than entire populations. Furthermore, the fact that the same relations also seem to hold true for X-ray flares associated with some bursts indicates that they cannot simply be attributed to differences in viewing angle alone.

The amount of dust formed depends on the initial composition of the gas; we show that it increases dramatically when oxygen-rich material is mixed into the ejecta.

The governing equations are derived by using the thin-tube approximation for both equilibrium state and linear perturbations. We find that there exist two types of eigenmodes corresponding to different wave numbers along the field line. One type has its maximum amplitude at the footpoint while another one has it near the apex. For each mode we calculate the frequency as well as the damping time due to radiative loss. It turns out that the frequencies of these modes depend on the density contrast between the base and top of the loop. In addition, they also depend on the ratio of the Alfvén speed inside the loop to that outside. Finally, we discuss how our results can be applied to observations.

However, only about 10% of all known planetary systems contain such massive objects. Most of these have been discovered through high-precision Doppler spectroscopy or direct imaging methods. In contrast, very few low-mass companions have been found so far because they produce smaller reflex motions and/or lower luminosity than their more massive counterparts. As a result, there exists a large gap in the distribution of masses among known extra-solar planets ranging from several Earth masses down to Neptune-like masses. It is therefore important to search for low-mass companions as well since they can provide valuable information regarding the formation process of planetary systems. \n \n One possible way to detect low-mass companions is to use high-angular resolution observations made with space-based telescopes like HST. Such observations allow us to measure the position angle of the host star relative to its nearby neighbors. If we assume that the observed motion is due solely to gravitational interaction with another body then we can derive the projected separation and position angle of the companion. By combining these results with accurate radial-velocity measurements taken simultaneously, we can obtain the full three-dimensional orbit of the companion which allows us to calculate its mass.",

In particular, we consider the problem of calculating the partition function of classical spin models at high temperatures. The proposed method can be used as a basis for constructing approximate algorithms for solving problems related to the calculation of thermodynamic characteristics of complex systems. Introduction.\nThe main goal of statistical mechanics is to describe the behavior of macroscopic objects (for example, gases) by using microscopic information about their constituents (atoms). This task becomes especially difficult when dealing with large systems consisting of many particles or spins. For such cases, it is necessary to use approximations, since direct calculations are impossible due to the exponential growth of the number of possible microstates with increasing system size N . One of these approaches is the so-called mean-field approximation  1  , according to which each particle interacts only with all other particles simultaneously; i.e., the interaction between different pairs of particles is neglected. However, even within this simplified model, the calculation of the partition function Z = Tr exp(−βH) (1) remains extremely complicated  2  .\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new methods for describing macroscopic configurations in terms similar to those used in quantum physics  3  -  8  . These studies were inspired by the fact that both classical and quantum descriptions have certain common features  9  : they are formulated in terms of wave functions ψ(x), where x denotes either positions of particles or spins, respectively. Moreover, the evolution of these wave functions obeys the same Schrödinger equation ih∂ t |ψ(t) = H|ψ(t) , where H is the corresponding Hamiltonian operator.

If there are too many electrons present at late times (due to an overabundance of 13N), they will be captured onto protons instead of being emitted as positrons; thus, less energy will be released than if no such process were occurring.

We find that for sufficiently rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields, AIC leads to an explosion with properties similar to those observed in SNe Ia. The explosion is driven by the release of gravitational energy as the collapsed core bounces back after reaching nuclear density. In addition, we show that the presence of a strong toroidal field can lead to significant asymmetries in the ejecta distribution. These asymmetries are likely responsible for the polarization signal detected in some SNe Ia. \n \n Keywords: Supernovae Type Ia, Rotation, Magnetic Fields, White Dwarf Stars, Accretion Induced Collapse \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Recent observations have shown that many supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) exhibit large amounts of linear polarization  1  . This has been interpreted as evidence that these events result from asymmetric explosions  2  , which may be caused by large-scale magnetic fields  3  or rapid rotation  4  . However, it remains unclear whether either mechanism alone could produce such highly polarized light curves  5  . \n \n Here we investigate how the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic field affects the outcome of accretion induced collapse (AIC), where a white dwarf star collapses into a neutron star  6  . For this purpose, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the code FLASH  7  . Our initial models consist of rigidly-rotating white dwarf stars with masses ranging between 0.6-1.2 Msun  8  . To account for the effects of general relativity on the structure of the white dwarf  9  , we use the polytropic equation of state P = Kρ Γ , where ρ denotes the mass density and P the pressure  10  . \nThe main goal of this work is to determine if AICs triggered by rapid rotation and/or strong magnetic fields can explain the high degree of polarization observed in SNe Ia  11  .",

Abstract : We give the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized , rotating white dwarf systems that conduct accretion - caused decay ( AIC ) . We show that for sufficiently rapid movement and large magnetic fields , AIC gives to an explosion with fields similar to those occurring in SNe Ia . The explosion is fueled by the return of gravitational force as the shattered core bounces back after reaching atomic density . In addition , we show that the presence of a large toroidal field can lead to considerable asymmetries in the ejecta distribution . These asymmetries are probably responsible for the polarization response found in some SNe Ia . Keywords : Supernovae Type Ia , Rotation , Magnetic Fields , White Dwarf Stars , Accretion Induced Collapse 1 Introduction Recent observations have shown that numerous supernovae type Ia ( SNe Ia ) display large concentrations of linear polarization 1 . This has been used as suggesting that these events result from asymmetric events 2 , which could be caused by large - wave magnetic fields 3 or rapid magnetic 4 . However , it exists unknown whether either method altogether could produce such strongly polarized light curves 5 . Here we investigate how the mix of rapid movement and strong magnetic field impacts the results of accretion inspired fall ( AIC ) , where a white dwarf system collapses into a dwarf star 6 . For this reason , we perform two - dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the code FLASH 7 . Our preliminary models comprise of rigidly - rotating white dwarf stellar with values ranging between 0 . 6 - 1 . 2 Msun 8 . To account for the impacts of general relativity on the structure of the white dwarf 9 , we using the polytropic expression of type P = Kρ Γ , where ρ denotes the density density and P the pressure 10 . The main goal of this project is to investigate if AICs triggered by rapid magnetic and / or large magnetic fields can explain the large level of polarization seen in SNe Ia 11 .",

We find that dust can form efficiently in SNR ejecta at high temperatures (T > 1000 K), but it is destroyed by sputtering due to collisions between ions and electrons when the temperature drops below T = 100 K. The surviving dust grains are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM). Our calculations show that the total mass of dust formed in primordial SNRs may reach up to 10^-4 Msun if we assume an initial metallicity Z = 0.1Zsun. This value agrees well with observations of nearby young SNRs. However, our model predicts too much carbonaceous dust compared to silicates observed in these objects. If this discrepancy persists after further improvements of the models, then some other mechanism should be responsible for producing silicates in SNRs. \n \n Keywords: dust, supernova remnant",

In particular, there are no known fundamental principles that can explain why the SM has three generations of quarks and leptons with such different masses or how gravity fits into this picture. Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to address these issues by introducing new particles and/or interactions which may be observed in future experiments.  Supersymmetry (SUSY), for example, introduces partners for all SM fields whose spin differs by one half unit. These partner states have identical gauge quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, so they could mix with them if SUSY were broken at low energy scales. This mixing would lead to deviations from SM predictions for observables like cross sections and decay rates. Many extensions of the Standard Model also predict new phenomena associated with extra dimensions of space-time. For instance, theories based on string/M-theory often contain additional spatial dimensions compactified down to tiny sizes.

This suggests that the progenitor star exploded through a denser region on the northern side than it did on the southern side.

Introduction \n \n It has been suggested that interstellar dust grains grow up to millimeter sizes or larger within dense molecular clouds because they can survive against destructive collisions with other particles (e.g., coagulation theory; Ossenkopf & Henning 1994).

To resolve this discrepancy, it was proposed that dust grains could be destroyed efficiently via collisional fragmentation when their size becomes comparable to the mean free path of hydrogen molecules (Ormel et al. 2007). \n \n Another possibility is that dust grains do not grow but rather fragment into smaller pieces during collisions (e.g., Blum & Wurm 2008).

We find that both microand macro-rheology are consistent with an elastic network model for which we can extract values for the number density of links between filaments as well as their stiffness. The results show that increasing the concentration of avidin leads to denser networks with stiffer links. This effect is more pronounced when the initial concentration of actin filaments is higher. Our findings suggest that the mechanical properties of actomyosin gels may be tunable through changes in the amount and/or type of crosslinks present within these systems. In living cells, cytoskeletal structures such as stress fibers or focal adhesions provide physical connections between cell components and play important roles in determining cellular mechanics  1  .

Abstract : We have studied the rheology of isotropic networks formed by crosslinking actin filaments with two different concentrations of biotin - avidin linkers , using microrheology experiments on single filament dynamics in addition with macrorheology observations conducted at short intervals ( 0 . 01 - 10 Hz ) . We prove that both microand macro - rheology are consistent with an elastic system model for which we can obtain values for the number density of connections between filaments as also as their stiffness . The results show that increasing the presence of avidin gives to denser networks with stiffer connections . This increase is more pronounced when the first density of actin filaments is higher . Our findings suggest that the mechanical behavior of actomyosin gels could be tunable through changes in the number and / or type of crosslinks found within these systems . In living cells , cytoskeletal structures such as stress fibers or cell adhesions play physical connections between cell components and play key positions in determining cell mechanics 1 . These structures comprise of bundles of semiflexible biopolymers called as actin filaments 2 , which are connected together via modified expression structures called crosslinks 3 . In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how the mechanical structures of biological structures depend on the microscopic behavior of the biological networks 4 . For example, it was shown recently that the viscoelasticity of reconstituted actomyosin gels depends strongly on the presence of myosins  5  . However , despite this progress our knowledge about the correlation between the macroscopic behavior of complex fluids and the microstructure of the constituent built components continues restricted 6 .",

In addition to this observation we find that the maximum achievable enhancement factor depends critically on the sample geometry. For samples having a thickness d < 1 mm it reaches values up to 100 times larger than those observed for thicker samples.

In this research we show results achieved within an effective field theoretical formulation 4 , where the relevant fields of freedom are quarks and gluons rather than independent hadronic states . This gives us to estimate the total cross section for quarkonium production in terms of elementary partonic subprocesses concerning small quarks g = u , d , s and gluons g . These include acoustic absorption off quarks and gluon - gluon fusion giving to the formed of quarkonia via the addition of a virtual qq couple 5 . Furthermore , inelastic reactions such as quarkonium dissociation into open heavy - flavor hadrons 6 have also been introduced 7 , 8 .",

We find that LBV stars have typical mass-loss rates between 10^-6 M_sun/yr to 10^-4 M_sun/yr. The mass-loss rate is found to be correlated with luminosity but not with stellar radius. In addition we report quasi-periodic modulations of radio supernovae associated with SN 1987A and SN 1993J which are likely due to periodic changes in their circumstellar environments.

We use these observations to study the rest-frame UV-optical properties of LBGs at redshifts 1<z<3.5. The main goal of this work was to investigate how the dust extinction evolves as a function of galaxy mass and star formation rate density over cosmic time. Our analysis shows that there are two different populations of LBGs: one population has low stellar masses (M*=10^10-10^11 Msun), high specific star formation rates (SSFR>100Gyr-1), and relatively small amounts of dust; while another population consists of more massive systems (M*>10^11Msun), lower SSFR values (SSFR<30Gyr-1), and higher levels of dust extinction. These findings suggest that the amount of dust increases with increasing galaxy mass for both local and distant galaxies.",

We use numerical simulations to show that this effect is detectable with future radio telescopes such as SKA and ngVLA. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting these effects depends on the angular resolution of the telescope used; we find that it can be improved significantly if one uses multiple frequency channels instead of single-frequency data.

Each transmitter can only adjust its own transmit power level based on local CSI knowledge at the transmitter side. In addition, each transmitter may turn off its radio completely when it does not have any data to send. The objective is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing both the power control policy as well as the transmission strategy for all users simultaneously under these constraints. \n \n First, we derive an upper bound on the achievable sum-rate using finite-rate feedback assuming Gaussian codebooks. Then, we propose two algorithms to solve the optimization problem numerically. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the performance gain achieved by our proposed algorithm over existing schemes.",

We find that IA introduces significant biases in cosmological parameters when only spectroscopic redshifts are available for calibration purposes. However, we show that these biases can be reduced by including photometric redshifts to calibrate the IA model. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the bias due to IA down to less than 1% level if at least 10 bands spanning 0.4-1 micron are used for photo-z estimation. This requirement becomes more stringent towards higher redshifts where the number density of galaxies decreases rapidly. The results presented here will help guide the design of future experiments aiming to measure dark energy through weak gravitational lensing. Introduction - Weak gravitational lensing has emerged as one of the most promising probes of dark energy  1-3 .

We find that there are two types of shallow decays with different physical origins. The first type has been widely discussed and can be explained as arising from either energy injection or refreshed shocks. However, we show that this scenario cannot explain all cases of shallow decays. In particular, it fails to account for those shallow decays occurring at late times when the external shock emission should have faded away completely. For these events, we propose another explanation -the second type of shallow decays-which may arise from the transition between the relativistic fireball phase and non-relativistic ejecta-dominated phase.

By searching through more than 10 000 hours of observation life scattered across virtually 2000 epochs , we identify dozens of different faint radio components which appear only once or twice in each epoch s data setting . Most of these systems are extragalaxtic , but we also produce numerous Galactic objects including pulsar field nebulae , supernova remnants , flare stars , and other forms of active galactic nuclei . Many of these newly found systems are not listed in older catalogs because their small sound - to - noise value gives them hard to obtain when seen individually . However , by merging different epochs combined , we can boost the intensity of our survey sufficient to predict especially very weak signals .",

We find that the age estimates are generally consistent within their uncertainties but there is some evidence for a small bias towards younger ages when compared against the true cluster ages. This bias may be due to the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star which does not take into account any scatter or spread in periods observed among coeval stars. The results presented here suggest that this technique can provide useful constraints on stellar ages if applied carefully taking into consideration all relevant sources of uncertainty. Keywords: Age determination, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology. 1 Introduction Stellar ages play a crucial role in many areas of astrophysics ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. In particular, accurate ages are needed to understand how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars remains challenging because they span several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity and exhibit complex evolutionary histories. For example, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be determined accurately through photometric techniques such as fitting theoretical isochrones to colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods cannot be easily extended beyond the red giant branch where the effects of convection become important. Furthermore, even though asteroseismic observations allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the interpretation of the resulting data requires detailed modelling of the structure and evolution of each star individually. As a result, other approaches must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars spanning different stages of evolution.\nGyrochronology provides another avenue for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity cycles driven by dynamo processes operating at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003) .

Their large luminosities mean they can be detected efficiently even at relatively low redshifts, while their red colours make them easy to identify spectroscopically. They also tend to reside in massive dark matter haloes which evolve slowly through cosmic time, making them useful tracers of the underlying mass distribution. As such, they offer unique opportunities to study both the growth of structures as well as the nature of dark energy driving its accelerated expansion (see e.g., Percival & White 2009 , for a review). \n \n Here we report the first measurement of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs in the redshift range 0<z<0.8 made possible by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) , the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (Colless et al.",

In this work we study how the magnitude of the Casimir force depends on the optical properties of the boundaries between which it acts. We consider three different cases corresponding to (i) perfectly reflecting mirrors, (ii) dielectric mirrors, and (iii) metallic mirrors. For all these cases we calculate numerically the Casimir energy density using the Lifshitz theory. Our results show that the Casimir force acting between two identical mirrors can be either repulsive or attractive depending on whether they are separated by air or water.

We use two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to show that such explosions can form disks with large opening angles if they are not too energetic or fast-expanding. The disk is formed because the outer layers of the star are swept up into a thin shell as it expands outward at high speed; this shell then breaks apart due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. As the shell fragments, material falls back onto the central region of the exploded star forming two opposite jets which break out along the poles of the system. These jets drive the expansion of the bipolar lobes. Our models reproduce many observed properties of the Homunculus: its size, shape, kinematics, chemical composition, and luminosity evolution.

Our results can be used to estimate the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting and gravitational lensing on observed spectra.

These features have been studied extensively over many years both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003 , Done et al 2004 . In particular, they show strong red-shifts indicating that the emitting gas orbits rapidly around the black hole. This rapid rotation causes additional shifts in energy due to relativistic Doppler boosts and gravitational lensing. Relativistic effects become more important if the emitting region has a high degree of rotational support or is viewed nearly face-on. It is therefore necessary to take these effects into account when interpreting observations of such systems. \n\nIn this work we consider the case where the illuminating source is located above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Such sources include magnetic flares produced within the disk itself or active regions associated with the inner edge of the disk.

We show that this concept can be extended by considering not only single metabolites but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as elementary units for measuring entropy. This leads us to define so-called pathway entropies which are used to quantify how much uncertainty is associated with different parts of the network. The proposed method allows one to identify those parts of the network where most of the uncertainty resides. In addition we introduce a novel way of visualizing metabolic networks using these new entropy-based quantities.

While atomistic molecular dynamics has been successfully used to investigate experiments occurring over short periods and short ranges 1 – 3 , finely - grained models have emerged as potent tools to explore longer timescales 4 – 6 . These alternative descriptions generally involve grouping groups of groups by one effective interaction region 7 – 9 . For example , in the instance of biopolymers like proteins 10 – 12 or nucleic proteins 13 – 18 , this method gives us to catch essential features of the basis proteins while reducing computational resources significantly 19 , 20 . Coarse - graining approaches also rely on maps the interactions among independent interactions onto effective potentials 21 . This simplification supports effective manipulation of configurational information using Monte Carlo 22 or Molecular Dynamics 23 techniques . Despite its efforts , however , plain - graining runs at the cost of losing detailed information about regional stability and fluctuations 24 . As a result , it becomes hard to precise explain mechanisms involving large conformational changes 25 . To address this matter , hybrid multiscale modeling frameworks have recently been built 26 . Here , coarsegrained representations are combined with more accurate microscopic models to give good estimates of bound charge interactions 27 and transition values 28 . Another essential aspect of plain - grained models concerns the selection of appropriate",

Keywords: Galaxy evolution; Stellar populations; Spectroscopy. 1 Introduction Galaxies are complex systems whose properties depend strongly on their mass, age, chemical composition, star formation history, and environment. These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight. Therefore, accurate measurements of all relevant physical parameters require detailed spectroscopic observations covering large wavelength ranges. Such studies are now possible thanks to new space missions like GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, Hubble Space Telescope, and most importantly, the upcoming European Space Agency s Gaia satellite.

Finally, we compare the message throughputs achieved by three popular overlay routing protocols: flooding, random walk, and epidemic routing.

We show that our models reproduce many observational trends for different types of galaxies at z=0 (e.g., luminosity functions), but also predict some new ones which can be tested with future surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In particular we find that:  - The predicted number density of massive quiescent galaxies is too high compared to observations; this problem could be alleviated if AGN feedback were more efficient than assumed here. - Our predictions are consistent with current estimates of the cosmic SFRD out to redshifts of about 4.5, although they tend to overpredict it slightly beyond that redshift. - At low masses (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) there appears to be an excess of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies in both the real Universe and in our simulations. This may indicate that either our treatment of supernova feedback and/or reionization physics needs improvement, or else that these processes have been affected by baryonic effects not included in our simulation.",

In addition we also detect a possible rebrightening feature around 100s post-burst time-scale. Our spectral analysis shows that the spectrum can be fitted well using both single power-law model as well as broken power law model.

The prompt emission lasted for about 1 s with an average photon value E = 300 keV in the 15 - 350 keV zone . We find that the temporal decay index is ~ 1 . 2 between 10s to 1000s post - decay time intervals which suggest that this activity contains to the class of ultra - long GRBs . In addition we also obtain a proposed rebrightening feature around 100s post - burst time - scale . Our statistical examination shows that the spectrum can be fitted good using both single force - product model as also as broken force force model . However , the strongest fitted parameters are found to be consistent within their data when compared with each other .

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

We use cosmological simulations to study how BH mass is related to galaxy properties in different merger histories. Our results show that mergers can significantly affect these relationships by increasing scatter at fixed luminosity or stellar velocity dispersion. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates. In addition, we find that mergers tend to increase the average BH-to-galaxy mass ratio as well as the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among massive galaxies. These findings are consistent with observations of AGN host galaxies.

We find that all these quantities are well described by single-parameter scaling relations as functions of radius r normalized by the virial radius Rvir.  The best-fit values of the normalization parameters depend on redshift but not significantly so; we therefore adopt fixed values based on our results for the two most distant clusters (z = 0.2 and 0.3) which yield good fits to the other six clusters. Our main conclusions are:  1. All cluster properties show significant evolution out to z ~ 0.3; this is consistent with previous studies using XMM data. 2. The gas fraction fgas(r/Rvir), defined as the ratio of the total thermal energy within a sphere of radius r to its gravitational binding energy, decreases monotonically outwards; it also shows some evidence for evolution with redshift. 3. The electron number density ne(r) increases inwardly toward the center of each cluster until reaching a peak value near r ~ 0.1r200 where r200 denotes the radius enclosing an average overdensity of 200 times the critical density of the universe. Beyond this point, ne(r) declines slowly or remains roughly constant depending on the cluster. 4.

We find that, in agreement with previous studies, evaporation causes GCs to lose stars preferentially on their low-mass end and thus steepens the MF slope towards lower masses. However, we show that this effect is counteracted by two competing processes: dynamical friction which removes massive stars more efficiently than less massive ones; and relaxation-driven core collapse which increases the central density of the cluster and makes it harder for massive stars to escape. The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs. This suggests that other processes are required to explain the shape of the observed MF. In particular, our results suggest that primordial binaries may be responsible for producing the high-mass power-law tail seen in many GCs.",

The first part of my talk will focus on the observational properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) that are found at high redshift z>6-7. These YMCs have masses up to 10^8 Msun and sizes of ~1kpc. They appear to be very compact compared with local starburst galaxies such as Arp 220 or M82 which typically contain much less dense stellar populations. We find that the observed size-mass relation of these distant YMCs agrees remarkably well with predictions based on numerical simulations of turbulent gas clouds collapsing under self-gravity.

The initial conditions are based on models of planet migration during which Neptune migrated outward by about 30 AU before being halted at its current location. Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper belt formed as a result of collisional grinding between bodies whose sizes were comparable to Pluto (r ~ 1000 km). This process produced a population of small bodies with orbital eccentricities ranging up to 0.3. Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these bodies to be scattered into highly eccentric orbits.

The first terms are made on models of planet migration during which Neptune shifted outward by about 30 AU before being interrupted at its final spot . Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper zone formed as a result of collisional fragments between components whose sizes were comparable to Pluto ( R ~ 1000 km ) . This system produced a population of small structures with angular eccentricities increasing up to 0 . 3 . Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these names to be scattered into extremely eccentric orbits . These results give an reason for why there exists to be no correlation between the larger distribution of KBOs and their resonance eccentricity .",

We propose an algorithm that is robust to link failures, but requires only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The proposed algorithm achieves global convergence under mild conditions on network topology. In particular, we show that if each node has at least one neighbor whose degree is greater than its own then our algorithm converges almost surely (a.s.) to the correct value. Our results also hold when there exists a small number of Byzantine nodes which may deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed behavior. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords: Sensor Networks; Distributed Consensus; Local Information Exchange; Robustness Analysis. 1 Introduction Distributed consensus problems arise naturally in many applications such as flocking  1  , formation control  2  , multi-agent coordination  3  , wireless sensor networks  4  , etc.. A typical example is the average-consensus problem: given a set of n agents connected by communication links, each agent holds some initial data xi(0) ∈ Rm, i = 1, ..., n; it aims to compute the average x̄=1/n∑in=1xi(0). This problem was first studied by Tsitsiklis et al.  5  . They showed that if all agents have access to the same fixed directed graph G, then the average-consensus problem can be solved using a simple linear iterative scheme. However, this assumption does not always hold true since the underlying communication graphs are often random due to unreliable links  6  .\nIn recent years, several researchers have investigated the design of distributed consensus algorithms in dynamic networks  7-10 . For instance, Olfati-Saber  7  considered the case where the communication links among agents change randomly according to independent Bernoulli processes. Under certain assumptions on the connectivity of the network, she proved that her algorithm converges almost surely (i.e., with probability one) to the desired average. Subsequently, Jadbabaie et al.  8  extended these results to undirected networks. More recently,",

The sample consists of 16,000 galaxies at 0 < z < 5 selected by their mid-infrared colors using Spitzer/IRAC observations as well as 1,500 X-ray point sources detected in deep Chandra observations. We find that both galaxy samples show significant levels of intrinsic variation on timescales ranging from days to years.

The theory developed by Altshuler, Aronov, and Khmelnitsky (AAK) explains this phenomenon as arising due to electron-electron interactions within the metal film.  In their original work they assumed that electrons are scattered elastically off impurities or phonons.  However, recent experiments have shown that there can be significant inelastic scattering between electrons which leads to additional contributions to the resistivity.

It has been known for many years to be surrounded by dusty material that obscures its visible spectrum.   The infrared excess emission detected around this object suggests it may have a circumstellar disk similar to those found around young stars such as T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be stars.   In addition, there are indications that the system contains a close companion which could also contribute to the observed infrared excess emission.    We present new photometric observations obtained using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea over the period 1997-2001 covering wavelengths between 0.9-2.5 microns.  These data show significant variations in both the near-infrared fluxes and colours of the central source consistent with changes in the amount of dust surrounding the star.  This behaviour is very similar to what is seen in other pre-main-sequence systems where accretion onto the central star causes periodic increases in luminosity accompanied by increased levels of reddening due to heating of the surrounding dust grains.   Our results suggest that the current level of activity in the system is relatively low compared to previous epochs but we cannot rule out the possibility that the recent increase in brightness was caused by a short-lived burst of enhanced accretion rather than steady-state accretion occurring throughout our observing campaign.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Scanning magnetoresistance microscopy of atom chips .\nAbstract:\nWe report scanning magnetoresistance microscopy (SMRM) measurements on an atom chip with gold wires and microtraps fabricated by focused ion beam milling. The SMRM images show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures, which are used to transport cold atoms between different trapping sites. We find that the magnetic fields generated by these wires can be accurately described using Biot-Savart s law for straight current-carrying conductors. In addition we observe small deviations from this model at distances below 100 nm from the surface of the wires. These deviations may arise due to stray currents induced in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the wires close to their surfaces. Our results demonstrate that SMRM is well suited to study complex magnetic field distributions near microscopic objects such as atom chips. Atom chips have been developed over recent years as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter waves  1, 2  . They consist of arrays of metallic wires and microtraps produced by focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling  3  , where ultracold atoms are transported along the wires before being trapped in the microtraps  4  .\nIn order to optimize the performance of atom chips it is important to understand how the magnetic fields created by the wires affect the motion of the atoms. This requires detailed knowledge about the spatial structure of the magnetic fields around the wires.

Abstract : We perform scanning magnetoresistance microscopy ( SMRM ) observations on an atom board with gold wires and microtraps fabricated by directed ion ion milling . The SMRM photographs show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures , which are used to deliver cool molecules between different trapping sites . We find that the magnetic fields generated by these connections can be correctly described using Biot - Savart s law for straight current - flow conductors . In addition we obtain small deviations from this model at lengths below 100 nm from the surface of the wires . These deviations could arise due to stray currents caused in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the currents close to their surfaces . Our results prove that SMRM is good useful to investigate complex magnetic field ranges near microscopic structures such as atom devices . Atom devices have been produced over past years as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter signals 1 , 2 . They comprise of arrays of solid cable and microtraps produced by directed - ion - box ( FIB ) comb 3 , where ultracold molecules are distributed along the bands before being trapped in the microtraps 4 .

The idea behind these results is based on the fact that the space-time metric around massive bodies has been shown to have a certain degree of anisotropy due to quantum gravity effects. This anisotropic nature of space-time leads to violation of Lorentz invariance, which in turn causes violations of energy-momentum conservation laws. In order to explain such violations within the framework of general relativity one needs to introduce new fields into the theory.

We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity s greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways.

The data were obtained with the Bolocam instrument on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to study star formation across large scales within these clouds. We find that the dust continuum emission is well correlated with infrared extinction maps derived from 2MASS near-infrared photometry.

Experimental error comes mainly from errors in input values for quark masses and decay constants. In addition we take into account also dependence of final result on choice of interpolating current. For each type of uncertainty we calculate its effect separately as well as total uncertainty which includes all sources mentioned above. Finally we compare our results with those presented recently in literature. \n \n Keywords: Systematics, Uncertainty, Hadronic Parameters, QCD Sum Rules, Quark Masses, Decay Constants. 1 Introduction \n \n In this work we study systematic uncertainties in determination of various hadronic parameters like masses, decay constants etc., using QCD Sum Rules  1  .

The model shows that there are limits imposed by protein stability on how complex an organism can be as well as how fast it evolves molecularly.   It also suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago when most animal phyla appeared simultaneously. This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension—simple versus complex, slow versus fast, unstable versus stable—the total number of possible combinations would be four (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), which corresponds to eight types of living matter. However, if we increase the resolution so that we now include four states per dimension—very simple versus simple versus complex versus very complex, very slow versus slow versus fast versus very fast,...",

The FMT is based on a decomposition into three different types of weighted densities that can be evaluated efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. We show how this new FMT yields excellent results compared to Monte Carlo simulations over wide ranges of packing fractions and orientations of the particles. In particular we find very good agreement between our theoretical predictions and simulation data at high packing fractions where previous approaches fail due to strong correlations among neighboring particles. Finally, we demonstrate that our method also allows us to accurately predict structural properties such as pair correlation functions and orientational order parameters. This work provides further evidence that FMTs provide a powerful tool to study complex fluids beyond simple spherical particle models. \nI.

We show how this HN can be used to explain several phenomena such as spontaneous emission, blackbody radiation, Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and Hawking radiation. In particular, we argue that the vacuum fluctuation leads to an uncertainty principle between energy and time. This implies that there are no particles with zero mass or spin. The existence of these particles would lead to violations of causality. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental tests for our proposal. Vacuum fluctuations play important roles in quantum field theory. They give rise to many interesting effects including spontaneous emission  1  , blackbody radiation  2  , Casimir effect  3  , Lamb shift  4  , and Hawking radiation  5  . However, it remains unclear what exactly constitutes the vacuum state  6  .\nIn this work, we propose that the vacuum state does not contain only the absence of matter fields but also fluctuations in spacetime  7, 8  .

The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).  We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:  the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.  In both cases we have considered three types of initial conditions: Gaussian random fields generated using the Zel dovich approximation, Gaussian random fields generated using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and white noise.  Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.  However, there are some differences between them at early times.  These differences can be explained as follows:  the Zel dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to other models because it does not take into account the pressure term in the fluid equation; the white noise model gives smaller fluctuations due to its statistical properties; finally, the Gaussian random fields obtained via the fast Fourier transform algorithm predict intermediate values.

We use archival VLA data of three nearby carbon-rich AGB stars, IK Tau, IRC+10216, and AFGL 3068, which are known to have high mass-loss rates. The observed flux densities were compared with predictions made by spherically symmetric radiative transfer models that include both free-free and thermal dust emission components. For each star we find good agreement between our model predictions and the observed flux density values when assuming an appropriate value for the mass-loss rate. Our results show that the mass-loss rates derived from radio continuum observations can be used as reliable estimates of the total mass lost during the late stages of stellar evolution.  These results also demonstrate how radio observations can provide important constraints on theoretical models of circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars.",

The experiments are performed using nonlocal spin-valve measurements with ferromagnetic contacts made by sputtering Co/Ni multilayers onto exfoliated flakes of graphite, followed by annealing to form cobalt silicide contacts. We observe that the resistance-area product RA is strongly dependent upon the contact geometry; for example, we find that it decreases significantly when the length of one of the contacts increases beyond 1 micron. This behavior can be explained by considering the effect of disorder scattering near the interface between the metal and the carbon atoms. In addition, we show that the magnitude of the spin signal depends sensitively on the relative orientation of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnets. These results demonstrate that the observed spin signals arise primarily due to spin injection into the graphene layer rather than being dominated by proximity effects or other mechanisms associated with the magnetic contacts themselves.",

The most prominent feature in our data set is an arc-like structure located at about 0.5 arcsec to the south-east of the central binary star. This region shows strong polarized emission up to 10% of the total intensity and has been previously identified as a reflection nebula by Weintraub et al. (1993) . We find that this feature can be explained by scattering off optically thin dust grains close to the midplane of the disk. In addition we detect two other bright features on either side of the central binary. These are also associated with high degrees of linear polarization but show no clear evidence for scattered light. Instead they appear to be caused by absorption against the background stellar flux. Finally, we identify three additional fainter structures in the southern part of the disk. All these features have similar polarization angles indicating that their origin may be related.",
