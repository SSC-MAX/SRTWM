The SMRM images show the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the wire structures, which are used to transport cold atoms between different trapping sites. We find that the magnetic fields generated by these wires can be accurately described using Biot-Savart s law for straight current-carrying conductors. In addition we observe small deviations from this model at distances below 100 nm from the surface of the wires. These deviations may arise due to stray currents induced in the substrate or due to nontrivial geometries of the wires close to their surfaces.

In this work we show how such an effect can arise naturally within the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting effective action contains terms which depend explicitly on the scale factor of the universe as well as its time derivatives. These terms lead to corrections to the standard Friedmann equations at high energies. Using these modified equations together with observational data we find that the present day value of the vacuum energy density agrees very well with observations if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately. This result suggests that our approach provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem.

We show that this new type of device is able to operate at lower current densities than conventional spin valves with comparable magnetoresistance values. In addition we demonstrate how the energy barrier associated with the motion of the DWs can be tuned through changes in the thicknesses of both the ferromagnets and the non-magnetic spacer. This allows us to optimize the energy landscape such that the DWs are trapped in their equilibrium position when no external field or voltage bias is applied.

We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius.

The aim of this study was to investigate how these interactions have changed over time. We used magnetic field measurements from Cluster 1 (C1) between 2001 and 2010 to calculate the flux density of energetic electrons at the Moon s surface for each orbit. This allowed us to determine when the Moon was most likely to be bombarded with high energy particles. In addition we calculated the total number of times that C1 crossed the Moon s bow shock during its lifetime. These results were compared against previous studies on the evolution of the Earth s magnetosphere. It has been suggested that there are two main types of interaction between the Earth and the Sun; coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which occur less frequently but produce more intense events than streamer belt driven storms.",

We argue that the lowest-lying excitations are described by open strings attached to quarks at one end and antiquarks at the other; these can be viewed as mesons or glueballs depending on whether they carry color charge or not.  The next set of excitations corresponds to closed strings which wind around the compactified dimension (the time direction) once or more times. These correspond to baryon resonances. Finally we consider higher-spin excitations corresponding to multiple winding modes of the closed string; these have spin greater than two but still less than the number of colors Nc. In this talk I will present some recent results obtained using holographic methods applied to gauge theories dual to supergravity backgrounds.

Abstract : We discuss how chiral stability is realized in QCD , with especially emphasis on its implications for the spectrum of excited states . We say that the lowest - lie excitations are described by open strings connected to quarks at one ending and antiquarks at the other ; these can be considered as mesons or glueballs depending on whether they carry color charge or not . The next class of excitations refers to shut strings which breeze around the compactified domain ( the time path ) once or more times . These correspond to baryon resonances . Finally we consider higher - pass excitations relating to different winding modes of the shut chord ; these have color larger than two but also less than the number of colors Nc . In this talk I will give some latest results produced using holographic techniques applied to gauge schemes dual to supergravity fields . This concept has been very effective in understanding numerous details of strongly - coupled gauge field dynamics including trapping , chiral wave breaking , and the dynamics of small quantum mesons . However it also offers an exciting different perspective on heavy quark mechanics such as the production of top - quark interactions in large - intensity collisions .",

We argue that there are at least two distinct ways to understand what it means for one problem to be reduced to another by an algorithm; these correspond roughly to the notions of polynomial-time reductions and Turing reductions respectively. The former is more commonly used than the latter, but we show how both can be understood in terms of each other using the notion of relativised polynomial time. In particular, we prove that every problem which is not NP-complete under Turing reductions must have some property which makes it easy to solve relative to any oracle set containing all NP sets. This result has implications for the relationship between P and NP, and also provides new insights into the structure of NP itself. Algorithmic reductions play a central role in computational complexity theory, providing a way of relating seemingly disparate classes of decision problems such as those belonging to the class NP (the non-deterministic polynomial time computable problems) with those belonging to the class co-NP (the complements of NP problems). However, despite their importance, relatively little attention has been paid to the precise meaning of the phrase  algorithmically reduces to ; indeed, even basic questions about the nature of this concept remain unanswered.",

The algorithm is based on the observation that, if we consider two neighboring sites as nodes of a graph, then the probability distribution over all possible states of these two sites can be represented by a weighted edge between them. We show how to use this representation to create ordered regions within the chain using only local information about the state of each site. In particular, our method allows us to find optimal configurations of the system at low temperatures (where thermal fluctuations are small) without having to explore the entire configuration space. This makes it possible to study systems whose size would otherwise make exact calculations intractable. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions even when applied to relatively short chains. Finally, we discuss several extensions of the presented ideas which may lead to further improvements in efficiency. \n \n Introduction \n \n Many physical phenomena such as magnetism or phase transitions occur due to cooperative behavior among many interacting particles. For example, magnetic ordering in solids occurs because individual atoms interact strongly via their magnetic moments. Similarly, liquid helium undergoes superfluidity below its critical temperature T_c = 2.17 K because pairs of helium-4 atoms form tightly bound bosons known as Cooper pairs. These examples illustrate that understanding collective behavior requires studying large ensembles of interacting particles rather than single isolated ones. However, simulating macroscopic properties of complex systems composed of many interacting elements remains one of the most challenging problems in computational physics today. Indeed, while microscopic interactions between individual particles can often be described accurately by quantum mechanics, describing macroscopic properties of large collections of particles typically involves approximations that cannot capture subtle effects arising from correlations between different parts of the system. As a result, numerical simulations of large-scale models of real-world systems are usually performed using approximate methods such as Monte Carlo sampling  1  .

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space.

Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

The IRDC is associated with the molecular cloud complex G327.3+0.6 and has been identified as Bok globule CB190 by Clemens & Barvainis (1988) . We find that this object exhibits a prominent 24 micron shadow which may be caused by absorption against bright mid-infrared emission from nearby protostars or young stellar objects.

We find that there is no correlation between the total luminosity or effective temperature of these objects and their mass-loss rates. The observed scatter may be explained by differences in chemical composition and/or pulsation properties among individual sources. In addition to this we show that the dust-to-gas ratio decreases towards higher temperatures for oxygen-rich as well as carbon-rich AGB stars. This indicates that the physical conditions at which dust forms are different in both types of evolved stars. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to improve current models describing the evolution of red giants. Keywords: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars; Dust formation; Red Giants; Mass loss. 1 Introduction Carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter Crich AGB) stars have been studied extensively over the past decades because they represent an important source class of interstellar matter. They lose large amounts of material through stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the outflowing gas. These winds play an essential role in shaping circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars and thus influence the appearance of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. However, despite numerous observational studies it remains unclear what determines the amount of mass lost by Crich AGB stars. It has been suggested that the total luminosity L * , the effective temperature T eff , the surface gravity g, the metallicity Z, the pulsation period P, and the initial mass M ini might all affectṀ . For example, Wood et al. (1992) , van Loon et al. (1999), Olofsson et al. (2002a) , Knapp & Morris (1985) , and Winters et al.

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate.

This result means that there are two communities of GPs : one population whose emission system has a short - spectrum cutoff near 400 MHz , and another population whose emission system stretches up to at least 2 GHz . Finally , we show that the number of GPs per regular data changes linearly with observing data over most of our data setting , indicating that the number of these events result independently of each other .",

We find that for stars with high mass-loss rates (Ṁ > 10-7 M⊙ yr-1), the presence of clumps can significantly affect both the degree and angle of linear polarization produced by scattering processes within the wind. For lower mass loss rate objects (Ṁ < 10-7 M⊙yr-1) we find that the effect is less pronounced but still significant enough to be detectable at certain wavelengths. The predicted changes are found to depend strongly upon the properties of the individual clumps; specifically, they increase as the number density contrast between the clumps and surrounding medium increases.

We say that for stellar with long weight - extinction periods ( [UNK] > 10 - 7 [UNK] yr - 1 ) , the presence of clumps can significantly alter both the number and edge of continuous polarization produced by absorption mechanisms within the breeze . For smaller mass loss rate objects ( [UNK] < 10 - 7 [UNK] - 1 ) we find that the effect is less pronounced but also large enough to be detectable at specified wavelengths .

We find that for PBH masses M ≫ 10^(10) g, the Bondi radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so that the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formula can be used to calculate the accretion rate.

The FMT is based on a decomposition into three different types of weighted densities that can be evaluated efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. We show how this new FMT yields excellent results compared to Monte Carlo simulations over wide ranges of packing fractions and orientations of the particles. In particular we find very good agreement between our theoretical predictions and simulation data at high packing fractions where previous approaches fail due to strong correlations among neighboring particles. Finally, we demonstrate that our method also allows us to accurately predict structural properties such as pair correlation functions and orientational order parameters.

These composite fermions form a Fermi sea which exhibits fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), i.e., they exhibit plateaus in their Hall conductance at fractions of e/2πh  2  .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to understand these phenomena within string theory  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  , but so far no complete description exists. One approach consists of studying the low-energy effective action describing the dynamics of the FQH fluid  7, 9  . This action contains a Chern-Simons term coupled to a set of charged scalar fields representing fluctuations around the mean-field solution corresponding to the filled lowest Landau level.

These composite fermions create a Fermi surface which exhibits fractional quantum Hall operation ( FQHE ) , i . k . , they show plateaus in their Hall conductance at fractions of E / 2πh 2 . In past years there have been numerous efforts to explain these dynamics within spiral field 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , but so much no complete formulation exists . One method means of studying the reduced - intensity effective behavior describing the dynamics of the FQH liquid 7 , 9 . This operation contains a Chern - Simons field coupled to a setting of charged scalar fields indicating fluctuations around the play - field solution relating to the filled lowest Landau level . It goes out that the generated system is described by a two - connected conformal field field ( CFT ) . Moreover , the CFT partition function evaluated on a torus coincides with the statistical measure over all states of the FQH fluid 10 .",

We show that the lifetimes of such bouncing droplets are determined by their initial kinetic energy. The dependence of the lifetime on this energy can be fitted well using a power law t ~ E0−α where α = 0.5 ± 0.1 for both numerical simulations and experiments. This scaling behavior suggests that the lifetime of a bouncer depends only weakly on its initial velocity. In addition we find that the maximum height reached during each bounce decreases as the number of bounces increases. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be used to estimate the surface tension of water based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have been studied extensively over recent years due to their potential applications in microfluidics  1  .

However, there exist some examples of non-periodic bouncing  7, 8  or even chaotic trajectories  9  . It was shown recently  10  that the lifetimes (i.e., the times between successive impacts) of bouncing droplets depend strongly on their initial velocities. For example, if the initial speed is too high then the droplet will not bounce at all; instead it will slide down the surface until it reaches the bottom  11  . On the other hand, if the initial speed lies below a certain threshold value then the droplet will bounce indefinitely  12  .",

We show that for any network with n nodes there are at most 2n eigenvalues different from zero (counting multiplicities). This bound is tight up to a constant factor when applied to trees or complete graphs. For general graphs we prove an upper bound of O(n log n) on the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues. In addition, we provide lower bounds showing that this estimate cannot be improved by more than a polylogarithmic factor.

We show that for any system with n networks there are at most 2n eigenvalues different from zero ( including multiplicities ) . This bound is tight up to a continuous factor when applied to trees or complete graphs . For universal graphs we prove an upper bound of O ( n log n ) on the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues .

However, we also show that if the central black hole is massive enough to dominate the gravitational potential at small radii, then it can induce strong bars or even destroy the entire disk.

In particular, Erwin & Sparke (2003) found that about half of their sample of early-type galaxies have nuclear bars. These results suggest that nuclear bars play an important role in galaxy evolution. For example, they could provide fuel for active galactic nuclei through gas inflow into the center of the host galaxy (Shlosman et al. 1990 ). On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies. Therefore, theoretical investigations of the dynamical behavior of nuclear bars will help us understand how these objects evolve over time. \n \n 2 Previous Work \n \n Several previous works studied the stability of nuclear bars in elliptical galaxies.

In this regime, we find that the charge distribution is characterized by alternating peaks separated by valleys which become more pronounced as temperature decreases. This behavior can be understood in terms of formation of a periodic structure due to inter-particle correlations. Our results suggest that such structures may exist experimentally in semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes. Introduction:-In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the electronic properties of nanostructures  1  . One dimensional systems have attracted particular attention because they provide a unique opportunity to investigate fundamental physical phenomena like Luttinger liquid  2  , fractional statistics  3  , and Wigner crystallization  4  .\nTheoretical studies of 1D quantum dots (QDs), i.e., QDs with only one dimension much smaller than other two dimensions, were first carried out by Lieb et al  5  who showed that these systems exhibit interesting features including shell filling effects  6  . Subsequently, several authors studied various aspects of QD physics  7, 8  . For example, it was shown that the energy spectrum of a QD depends strongly on its shape  9  . It also turns out that the single particle wave functions of a QD depend sensitively on the boundary conditions  10  . Recently, some experimental progress has been made towards realizing 1D QDs  11  -  13  . However, most experiments so far have focused mainly on transport measurements  14  -  16  rather than direct imaging  17  . Therefore, theoretical investigations play an important role in understanding the underlying physics of these systems  18  -  20  .\nIn this work, we consider a model consisting of N non-interacting fermions confined to a 1D QD with parabolic confinement potential V(x).

In addition we show how these parameters can be constrained by fitting the full spectrum of an unresolved galaxy. This work was performed within the framework of the ESA Gaia mission. Keywords: Galaxy evolution; Stellar populations; Spectroscopy. 1 Introduction Galaxies are complex systems whose properties depend strongly on their mass, age, chemical composition, star formation history, and environment. These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight. Therefore, accurate measurements of all relevant physical parameters require detailed spectroscopic observations covering large wavelength ranges. Such studies are now possible thanks to new space missions like GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, Hubble Space Telescope, and most importantly, the upcoming European Space Agency s Gaia satellite.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping.

We consider both kinetic and flow descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas , which are relevant for numerous distance and lab fields . In this context we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations ( DNS ) of the Vlasov - Maxwell system . The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics - We perform DNSs of the Vlasov - Poisson system in attempt to characterize the statistical features of the electrostatic field fluctuations generated by an first spectrum of Alfvenic modes . Our investigation shows that the energy cascade continues towards smaller spatial sizes until it reaches the ion Larmor radius level where it is directed into adjacent wavenumbers through Landau damping . At these small values , the energy transition rate drops due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors . This system gives to the formed of intermittency in the distribution system of molecules . 2.

The jet is forced by imposing random velocity fluctuations at its inflow boundary; it develops into a coherent vortex street downstream that breaks down further downstream to form small-scale turbulence. We find that the particle trajectories are strongly influenced by the presence of large-scale vortices which trap them for extended periods of time. In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well. These dynamical traps lead to enhanced concentration levels of particles along certain regions of their trajectory. Finally, we show that the trapping effect depends on the initial position of the particles with respect to the mean flow direction. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in the transport of pollutants or other tracers in geophysical flows such as atmospheric jets.

The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years  1, 2  . It provides access to extreme ultraviolet radiation  3  , which enables novel applications such as attosecond pulse generation  4  , photoelectron spectroscopy  5  , and tomography  6  .\nThe underlying physical mechanism behind HHG was first explained within the semiclassical three-step model  7, 8  : An electron tunnels out of its atomic core into the continuum upon interaction with the electric field of the laser light. Afterwards it propagates freely before being driven back towards the nucleus by the same field. Finally, it recombines with the parent ion emitting a photon whose energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy lost due to tunneling  9  . Since then, several extensions have been developed  10  including the so-called quantum-orbit theory  11  , which takes into account the influence of the nuclear potential on the electron dynamics  12  .

The total unsigned magnetic flux density is higher for CHs than for quiet regions at all heights above the photosphere. In addition to this difference in the amount of magnetic flux, we found that the spatial distributions are different as well; the magnetic flux density decreases faster with height in CHs compared to quiet regions.

The temperature dependence of the optical conductivity shows that the charge gap opens below TMI = 135 K, which is consistent with previous results obtained on single crystals grown under different conditions. In addition we find evidence for an additional energy scale associated with the formation of excitons near 50 meV. We show that this feature can be explained within a simple model based on electron-phonon interaction between molecular orbitals.

Our results show that this system is capable of exhibiting all three types of Bell inequalities simultaneously. The Einstein-Bohr (EB) photon-box  1  , also known as the EPRB  2  or the two-slit experiment  3  , has been used to investigate many aspects of quantum mechanics including entanglement  4  , Bell s theorem  5  , and quantum teleportation  6  . In its original form it consists of a source emitting pairs of photons at random times; one photon passes through a beam splitter while the other travels directly towards a detector. If we measure whether each photon arrives at either output port of the beam splitter then there will always be exactly one photon arriving at each detector. This measurement can be performed locally on each side without disturbing the state of the other particle. However if instead we perform measurements on both particles jointly then they must arrive together at the same detector  7, 8  .\nIn order for these experiments to exhibit genuine quantum effects, the detectors need to have high efficiency so that the probability of detecting more than one photon per pair is negligible  9  . Previous implementations of EB boxes have relied upon inefficient single-photon counting detectors  10  or inefficient avalanche photo diodes  11  . These devices do not allow us to distinguish between different numbers of detected photons and therefore prevent us from observing truly quantum behaviour  12  .",

The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states.

In this article we present some new results on the DualHeap algorithm that shed light on its efficiency and inherent parallelism.    We show how it can be implemented using only O(logn) bits per element while still maintaining its efficiency guarantees.   This implementation requires no extra space beyond what is needed by the input data itself and thus fits well with modern storage devices like flash memory or hard disks where storing large amounts of data is cheap but accessing individual items may be expensive.

Analysis of 9 Years of EGRET Data .\nAbstract:\nWe have analyzed nine years (1991â€“1998) of data on blazars observed by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). We find that there is no significant correlation between gamma-ray flux and photon index for individual sources, but we do see evidence for an anti-correlation when all sources are combined into one sample. This result suggests that the spectrum hardens as the source brightens. The lack of such a trend in single-source analysis may be due to insufficient statistics or intrinsic spectral variability within each source. Our results also suggest that the average luminosity of blazars increases faster than linearly with increasing redshift. These findings can help us understand how relativistic jets work in active galactic nuclei. Relativistic jets play important roles in many astrophysical phenomena including active galactic nuclei (AGNs), microquasars, pulsar winds, and gamma ray bursts (GRBs).

Analysis of 9 Years of EGRET Data . Abstract : We have analyzed nine years ( 1991â€ “ 1998 ) of data on blazars seen by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope ( EGRET ) . We show that there is no considerable correlation between gamma - ray density and photon index for individual components , but we do show data for an anti - correlation when all components are combined into one sample . This result means that the spectrum hardens as the source brightens . The absence of such a trend in single - source data could be due to lacking statistics or intrinsic statistical variability within each source . Our results also suggest that the average luminosity of blazars changes rate than linearly with increasing redshift . These findings can help us learn how relativistic systems operate in active galactic nuclei . Relativistic jets play key importance in numerous astrophysical observations including alpha galactic assemblies ( AGNs ) , microquasars , pulsar winds , and gamma disk winds ( GRBs ) . In AGNs , they are supposed to carry away most of the energy produced at the main engine . However , it continues unknown what physical mechanisms drive these outgoing outflows .",

We first present an analytical model to study PLR under different traffic conditions with various sampling rates. Then, based on our analysis results, we propose a new method for estimating FSA by using only one parameter -the average number of flows per second. Finally, through extensive experiments conducted over both real-world traces and synthetic data sets, we show that our proposed estimation method is accurate enough to be used as a practical tool for evaluating network monitoring systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related works about netflow sampling and exporting. In Section 3, we describe our experimental environment.

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",

The observed profiles show that the blue wing is enhanced relative to the red one at all heights above the limb where we can see the flare emission. This effect is more pronounced for higher altitudes. We find that this behavior cannot be explained solely by Doppler shifts due to bulk plasma motions along the LOS. In addition, our modeling shows that the observed profile shapes cannot be reproduced without including nonthermal electron beams as an additional heating source. \n \n Keywords: Solar flare, chromospheric lines, nonthermal electrons, radiative hydrodynamics model, RH code, Mg II k line, line asymmetry. 1 Introduction \n \n During solar flares, intense energy release leads to rapid changes in physical conditions throughout the atmosphere of the Sun. These include temperature increases up to several million degrees Kelvin, strong magnetic fields, high densities, and large velocities. All these factors affect the shape of spectral lines emitted by different atmospheric layers. For example, it has been shown that the intensity ratio between two Fe I lines formed at different temperatures depends on the height of formation of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips 2004) . Also, the presence of nonthermal electrons causes significant deviations from Maxwellian velocity distributions leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al. (1990) ; Doschek et al. (1991) ), while bulk flows lead to Doppler shifts of the line center position (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Brosius 2009 ). Therefore, studying the temporal evolution of the line profiles provides important information about the dynamics of the flaring region. However, interpreting such data requires detailed knowledge of the underlying physics involved in the processes responsible for the observed phenomena. \n \n In particular, the study of the Mg II h&k lines offers unique opportunities to investigate various aspects of solar flares because they form over a wide range",

We propose an algorithm that achieves stability by using a simple backoff mechanism based on local information only. The proposed scheme is shown to be throughput optimal under certain conditions. In addition, we show how our results are related to existing work on this topic. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our approach over other schemes. Wireless broadcast has been studied extensively for many years due to its wide range of applications such as data dissemination, file transfer, video streaming, etc.. However, most previous works assume that all transmissions occur synchronously or within some fixed schedule. This assumption does not hold true when there exist multiple transmitters competing for channel resources simultaneously. Random access (RA) protocols have recently received much attention because they allow users to send packets whenever it is convenient without requiring tight synchronization among them  1  . Unfortunately, RA introduces additional challenges compared to traditional synchronous transmission models since collisions may happen frequently if no coordination exists between different transmitters  2  .\nIn this paper, we study the problem of broadcasting in multi-hop wireless networks with random access. Specifically, each node maintains one packet which needs to be transmitted to every other node in the network eventually. Each node chooses independently and uniformly at random a starting time slot to begin transmitting its packet. If two or more nodes start their transmissions at the same time slot, then these transmissions collide and none of them will reach the intended receivers successfully. Our goal is to design distributed algorithms that achieve both stability and high throughput while minimizing the number of retransmissions required to deliver messages reliably.",

The proposed approach is based on the concept that all users should be allocated their required data rates at minimum total transmit power consumption while maintaining acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). We first develop a new analytical model which can accurately predict the average received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under different system configurations.

Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation  11  which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system  12  . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small.

The current–voltage characteristics show clear signatures for molecular conduction, such as Coulomb blockade peaks and negative differential resistance regions.

We prove that our method always selects at least one node as the input sites when all nodes are reachable from each other . Furthermore , we show through simulations that our method performs good even under numerous system circumstances such as dynamic topologies or restricted transmission ranges .

We show that these actions are not generally invariant under local gauge transformations unless certain conditions on their form are satisfied. These results have important consequences for the construction of gauge-invariant observables in supersymmetric gauge theories. They also provide an explanation why it is possible to construct nontrivial superpotentials even though supersymmetry does not allow any explicit breaking terms at tree level. Finally we argue that our findings can be used to resolve some puzzling features observed recently in lattice simulations of N = 1 supersymmetric QCD with four flavors. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories play an important role both in particle physics and string theory. Their low-energy dynamics is described by an effective action which contains all quantum corrections due to the integration over heavy fields like quarks or gluons. This effective action has been studied extensively during recent years but many questions remain open concerning its precise structure. One particular issue concerns the question whether this action is gauge invariant. It was shown already more than twenty years ago  1  that if one integrates out only massive fermions then the resulting effective action is indeed gauge invariant. However, when including also massive bosonic degrees of freedom there exist counterexamples where the effective action fails to be gauge invariant  2  . Recently, this problem attracted renewed interest because of its relevance for the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories  3, 4  .\nIn this work we study the gauge invariance properties systematically using functional methods. Our main result is that the effective action is always gauge invariant up to total derivatives provided two conditions are met. First, the effective action must contain no higher-order time-derivatives acting on the gauge field. Second, the coefficients appearing in front of the various operators in the effective action should satisfy certain relations. For example, they cannot depend explicitly on the gauge coupling constant g. If either condition is violated then the effective action will fail to be gauge",

This effective act has been studied much during previous years but numerous concerns exist open concerning its precise mechanisms . One special matter concerns the matter whether this act is gauge invariant . It was shown also more than twenty years ago 1 that if one integrates out only large fermions then the subsequent effective operation is also gauge invariant . However , when including also enormous bosonic forms of freedom there exist counterexamples where the effective operation fails to be gauge invariant 2 . Recently , this problem attracted continued interest because of its importance for the understanding of anti - perturbative behavior in supersymmetric gauge schemes 3 , 4 . In this research we examine the gauge invariance behavior systematically using functional techniques . Our main result is that the effective act is always gauge invariant up to total derivatives whenever two circumstances are met . First , the effective act must include no higher - come time - derivatives acting on the gauge field . Second , the coefficients appearing in front of the different operators in the effective act should fulfill certain relations . For example , they cannot depend explicitly on the gauge interaction factor g . If either condition is violated then the effective act will fail to be gauge",

We show that RSP is strongly affected by the presence of the Luttinger parameter, which describes the strength of electron-electron interactions. In particular we find that for large values of the Luttinger parameters the magnitude of RSP decreases significantly due to an increase in the effective mass of holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RSP can be controlled by applying external electric fields perpendicular to the plane of the 2D hole gas. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments on GaAs quantum wells. The effect of the Luttinger terms, structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), and Zeeman splitting on resonant spin polarization (RS P ) has been studied using density functional theory. It was found that RS P is suppressed when the Luttinger parameter increases because it leads to larger effective masses.

This planet can be considered as a hot Jupiter - like planet because it orbits very close to its host star .

In order to understand how these phenomena take place, it is important to study their properties individually. However, this task has been difficult because most of them have very fine structure and they often overlap each other spatially.

The proposed method is based on the idea of using multiple views, each one capturing different aspects or features of the same dataset. We show how this can be achieved by defining a set of views for each node in the decision tree model being learned. These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent s training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL). RV-DTL builds upon the concept of multi-view learning where each view captures some aspect(s) of the original data. More specifically, our approach defines a set of views for every internal node in the decision tree being built. Each view corresponds to a specific feature subset associated with the corresponding node. Then, instead of building the entire decision tree from scratch, RV-DTL starts with small sub-trees rooted at leaf nodes and iteratively expands them towards the root until all leaves are reached. At each expansion step, RV-DTL selects the best split among those available according to the information gain criterion. Finally, the final decision tree is constructed by merging together...",

With decreasing temperature down to 77 K, the permittivity increased slightly while the loss tangent decreased significantly due to the freezing out of mobile ions. At cryogenic temperatures, two relaxation processes were observed in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 kHz. The first process was attributed to the grain boundary effect; it shifted towards higher frequencies as the temperature decreased. The second process was associated with ferroelectric domain wall motion; its relaxation time constant remained almost unchanged when the temperature changed.",

The flow is forced at large scales by adding to the momentum equation an external force that has zero mean but whose Fourier transform contains both positive and negative wavenumbers. We find that this type of forcing excites two distinct types of modes in the system: vortical and wave-like modes. Vortical modes are characterized by strong vertical motions concentrated near the center of the domain; they have low horizontal velocities and their kinetic energy decays rapidly as we move away from the center. On the other hand, wave-like modes are characterized by weak vertical motions distributed over larger regions of space; they have high horizontal velocities and their kinetic energies decay slowly or even increase slightly when moving away from the center. In addition, these waves can be either stationary or propagating horizontally depending on whether the forcing spectrum peaks at small or large horizontal wavenumber respectively.",

The temperature of the blackbody component varies between 0.6-0.9 keV while its radius ranges between 3-7 km depending on whether or not the absorption column density was allowed to vary freely during fitting. In addition, we also found evidence for a soft excess below 1 keV in some of our spectra.

We show that these flows are governed by an exact functional differential equation which is derived using the background field method. The solution to this equation yields all possible counterterms needed to render the theory finite at any order in perturbation theory. This result generalizes previous results obtained within the context of flat space-time. In particular we find that the beta functions for the gravitational couplings do not vanish even if one considers only pure Yang-Mills theories without matter fields. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the running of the gravitational coupling constants can be determined completely in terms of the beta functionals associated with the non-gravitational sectors. Finally, we discuss how our formalism may be used to study the effects of radiative corrections on black hole entropy. Introduction: Gauge theories play a central role in modern particle physics. They provide a description of fundamental forces such as electromagnetism or weak nuclear force. However, it has been known since the early days of QED (quantum electrodynamics) that perturbatively quantizing gauge theories leads to ultraviolet divergences. These divergences have to be removed by adding appropriate local counterterms to the classical action. It turns out that there exist infinitely many different ways to add these counterterms so that the resulting effective action remains invariant under the original gauge symmetry transformations. Therefore, the choice of the correct set of counterterms depends crucially on the regularization scheme chosen to regulate the infinities appearing during the calculation of Feynman diagrams.

Introduction \n \n Supermassive black holes reside in the center of most massive galaxies. Their growth is thought to be fueled by gas inflow driven by gravitational torques produced during mergers and/or interactions between galaxies (Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Hopkins et al. 2006) . However, it remains unclear what happens after this fuel supply runs out. One possibility is that the black hole continues growing via radiatively inefficient accretion flows (Narayan & Yi 1994) , which may produce powerful winds and jets that can drive large-scale outflows into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) (Silk & Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ). Another possibility is that the black holes become dormant as the ISM becomes too hot to cool efficiently (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006 ) until another merger event triggers renewed activity. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for shutting off black-hole growth will help us understand why some galaxies have large black holes while others do not. \n \n 2.

We find that the planet s ability to open a gap is determined primarily by its accretion rate onto the planet (which depends on the planet s mass) rather than by its luminosity or temperature. The critical planet mass decreases with increasing disk viscosity because higher viscosities lead to more rapid angular momentum transport across the planet s orbit which reduces the planet s ability to accrete gas. For fixed viscosity, we find that the critical planet mass increases with decreasing surface density power law index because lower values of this parameter correspond to steeper radial profiles of the disk s surface density which leads to stronger gravitational torques exerted by the planet.

The proposed model is based on an extension of the work done by Horowitz and Maldacena (HM) who showed that the entropy of extremal Kerr-Newman black hole agrees exactly with the microscopic counting of states in N=4 super Yang-Mills gauge theory at strong coupling. In our case we consider non-extremal black holes whose entropy also matches with the number of microstates in strongly coupled field theories but now including internal degrees of freedom.

We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations.

We find that it has developed a strong infrared excess due to dust formation at temperatures between 1000-2000 K. This suggests that the object may have undergone a recent episode of enhanced mass loss on a time scale of years or decades prior to our observations. In addition we detect emission lines of hydrogen and helium indicating ongoing mass loss. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that this object underwent a late thermal pulse (LTP), i.e., a rapid increase in luminosity followed by a period of high mass loss. If so, then the LTP would have occurred within the last few hundred thousand years. Based on these findings we propose a revised evolutionary model for V4332 Sgr including a VLTP event as well as a subsequent superwind phase.",

The observed behavior can be explained within the framework of the spin-fermion model if one assumes that the spin-wave lifetime decreases rapidly at temperatures close to T* due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles. This interpretation implies that the pseudogap opens already below T* as suggested previously. \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high-temperature superconductors using neutron scattering techniques  1-5 . Neutron scattering allows us not only to investigate the static structure factor S(Q) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons  6 . It was found recently  7-9  that the low energy spin wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 displays unusual features compared to conventional metals. For example, it exhibits a strong dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions  8  and shows significant deviations from the usual linear dependence between the inverse spin wave velocity and momentum  9 . These results have stimulated theoretical studies  10-12  aimed at understanding how these unconventional spin wave properties are related to the electronic structure of the CuO2 planes. However, little attention has so far been paid to the effect of doping on the spin wave dynamics. Here we present new experimental data obtained on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX (x= 6.35), where x denotes the oxygen content  13 . Our main goal is to explore whether the spin wave properties change significantly when going away from optimal doping towards lower values of x.",

Abstract : We report on decay scattering experiments conducted to research magnetic excitations in an underdoped cuprate superconductor , YBa2Cu3Ox ( x = 6 . 35 ) . We notice that the intensity and linewidth of the lowest - value charge beams decline with increasing heating up to T * ~ 150 K , which is higher than Tc by about 50 K . The seen behavior can be described within the context of the magnetic - fermion model if one assumes that the charge - wave life decline rapidly at depths close to T * due to the decay into fermionic quasiparticles . This construction assumes that the pseudogap starts also below T * as indicated previously . Introduction In subsequent years there has been considerable interest in studying the features of large - rate superconductors using decay scattering techniques 1 - 5 . Neutron background allows us not only to investigate the periodic structure factor S ( Q ) but also dynamic correlations such as phonons or magnons 6 . It was found recently 7 - 9 that the reduced intensity magnetic wave spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 exhibits extraordinary features versus to standard metals . For example , it exhibits a fine dispersion anisotropy along different crystallographic directions 8 and shows considerable deviations from the normal linear dependence between the dual quantum wave speed and value 9 . These results have stimulated theoretical research 10 - 12 directed at understanding how these alternative spin wave structures are connected to the electronic behavior of the CuO2 molecules . However , little interest has so yet been made to the influence of doping on the spin wave dynamics . Here we show latest experimental data collected on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX ( x = 6 . 35 ) , where x denotes the oxygen content 13 .

In this work we study the spin current through an interface between two ferromagnetic layers with different coercive fields by using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation combined with the Slonczewski spin-transfer torque term. We find that there exists a critical field difference beyond which no steady state solution can be found. The results are consistent with previous experimental observations. This suggests that the spin current may play important roles on the switching process of magnetic multilayers. Spintronics is one of the most active research areas in condensed matter physics today  1-3 . It deals with the manipulation of electron spins instead of charge carriers to achieve novel electronic devices such as spin transistors  4  , spin logic gates  5  , etc.. One of its central concepts is the spin current  6  . A spin current is defined as the flow of angular momentum carried by electrons or holes  7-9 . Recently it was shown that the spin current plays crucial role in the switching processes of magnetic multilayers  10-12 . For example, when a spin-polarized current passes through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the injected spin current will exert a torque on the local magnetization due to the so-called spin-transfer effect  13  . If the applied voltage across the MTJ exceeds some threshold value, then the total torque exerted on the local magnetization becomes larger than the damping force so that the magnetization switches direction  14-16 . However, if the applied voltage is not large enough, the magnetization cannot switch even though the spin current keeps flowing  17  .\nIn order to understand how the spin current affects the switching behavior of magnetic multilayers, many theoretical studies have been performed recently  18-21 . Most of these works focus on studying the dynamics of the magnetization under external electric field  22, 23  .

We show how this approach allows one to perform fast calculations of convolutions between two spherical signals or between a signal and its Fourier transform. As examples we apply our technique to calculate correlation functions of CMB temperature fluctuations and to compute power spectra of simulated galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of these methods to higher-dimensional spaces. Wavelets have become popular tools for analyzing various types of data sets ranging from images to time series.

Many extensions of the SM predict extra contributions to the effective four - fermion interaction Lagrangian 6 which could lead to observable deviations from the predictions of the SM 7 , 8 . For example , it has recently been shown 9 that some models of quantum force 10 could induce an information dependent refractive index n = 1 + εE / E0 where E0 is a characteristic level connected with the quantum concept 11 . This would result in a modification of the magnetic mix area sin2θ12 = 1−cos2θ12 ≈ 1 + ε / 2 + O ( ε3 ) 12 giving to possibly large impacts on the propagation of neutrinos 13 . In addition to these theoretical motivations , there exist numerous experimental indications pointing towards proposed alternative science beyond the SM 14 : i ) Large solar 15 and solar 16 neutrino flow deficits ; v ) LSND 17 and MiniBooNE 18 anomalies indicating short - baseline νμ → νe absorption interactions not predicted within three - flavor neutrino oscillations 19 ; iii ) Anomalies in the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment",

The observed X-ray luminosity Lx ~ 3×1033 erg s-1 can be explained by the decay energy of radioactive nuclei produced in the core collapse supernova explosion at t ~ 1s after the birth of the progenitor star. We show that the total amount of 56Ni synthesized during the explosion is about 0.1M⊙ which agrees well with the theoretical prediction for massive stars. In addition to the nuclear burning, we consider the effects of magnetic field decay due to ohmic dissipation as well as gravitational wave emission. It turns out that these processes are not important enough to explain the present state of E1207 within our lifetime. However, if the initial magnetic field strength was larger than 1013 G, it could have been reduced down to the current value of 5×1012 G through ohmic dissipation before the age of the universe reached 13Gyrs.",

If there are too many electrons present at late times (due to an overabundance of 13N), they will be captured onto protons instead of being emitted as positrons; thus, less energy will be released than if no such process were occurring.

We found that all these sources show strong Fe K emission lines and their line widths are broader than those expected from thermal broadening at kT = 100 keV. The observed line profiles can be reproduced well by relativistic disk reflection models including Compton scattering effects. These results suggest that there is an additional component to the X-ray continuum other than the standard thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes. In addition, we find that the iron abundance relative to solar value is higher than 1.5 times in three out of four objects.

Abstract : We result on Suzaku observations for four active galactic sites ( AGNs ) found by Swift / BAT survey , which are considered as obscured AGNs with density density larger than 10 24 cm - 2 . We found that all these components show bright Fe K emission bands and their line widths are broader than those expected from thermal broadening at kT = 100 keV . The seen line profiles can be reconstructed good by relativistic disk reflection models including Compton reflection models . These results suggest that there is an extra component to the X - witness continuum other than the standard narrow accretion rings around supermassive black belts . In addition , we find that the metal density comparable to solar value is higher than 1 . 5 twice in three out of four observations . This supports that the main components of these obscured AGNs could have been buried under heavy rich torii . Finally , we discuss alternative origins of this different type of buried supermassive black spaces using on our observational results .",

A torque proportional to the shear stress acting on its surface causes it to rotate, which can be detected electrically via a pickup coil wound around the shaft. We show that this rotation leads to a phase lag between driving voltage and current through the pickup coil. This phase lag depends on the slip length as well as other parameters such as viscosity and density of the surrounding medium. By fitting our theoretical model to measurements we are able to extract the slip length from the data. Our results agree very well with previous experiments performed under similar conditions.

We find that there is no instability at zero temperature when the chemical potential lies between two consecutive energy levels of the system. This result holds true even if we consider finite temperatures as well. In particular, this implies that the ground state remains stable against collapse into a single particle state (fermionization) or formation of bound states with more than 2 particles (bosonization). The results are also valid for higher spins. Our analysis can be extended to other models such as those describing cold atoms trapped inside optical lattices.

Zero point energy (ZPE) is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to create particles out of nothing. Although ZPE cannot actually exist because it violates the laws of physics, it does provide useful insight into certain phenomena observed within our universe. For example, if we consider the expansion of space-time during the early stages of the universe s existence, then it seems reasonable to assume that the volume of space increased exponentially over time due to the rapid release of ZPE. If so, then the total mass-energy density would decrease rapidly until all available ZPE had been released.

In this study we investigated whether exposure to chronic social defeat (CSD) can induce anhedonic-like behavior in male C57BL/6J mice. We found that CSD-exposed animals exhibited decreased preference for sucrose solution compared with control group. Moreover, CSD-exposed mice showed increased immobility time during forced swimming test as well as reduced locomotor activity in open field test. Finally, we observed significant decrease in dopamine release in nucleus accumbens shell after acute administration of amphetamine in defeated mice. These results suggest that CSD may be used as animal model of anhedonia.

The results show that there are significant differences in the IM plasma pressure profiles obtained with different satellites. In particular, the pressure profile derived from GEOS-1 observations shows a sharp peak near L = 3 , while those inferred from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 data exhibit much broader peaks around L = 4 . These discrepancies may be due to the fact that these satellites have different orbits which sample different regions of space. It is also found that the pressure profiles inferred from the three satellites agree well when they are shifted outward along the L-shell coordinate system.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Generating Minimally Coupled Einstein-Scalar Field Solutions from Vacuum Solutions with Arbitrary Cosmological Constant .\nAbstract:\nWe present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 . Even today there exist many open questions about black holes  4  . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",

Even today there exist numerous open problems about black holes 4 . One reason why finding precise solutions is so hard is that most models of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions . Another problem exists when trying to seek solutions describing systems with numerous interacting components like black spaces surrounded by matter or other fields . Here one generally has to answer complicated differential equations numerically which means it hard to seek all logical solutions even if their solution was assured theoretically . This problem becomes especially severe if one likes to research experiments at large interactions since then numerical techniques become less accurate due to large corrections emerging from higher orders in perturbation field .",

This result stands regardless if the signals are dependent across rate or rate . The optimal number of receive anten - nas tends as more transmit antennas are used by the transmitters . For example , we show that using four send antennas results in the highest sum - rate when three receive antennas are used per user ; therefore , five receive antennas should be used rather if eight receive antennas are used .",

We show that, under certain conditions, the applied field can be used as a guiding field to direct the growth of precipitate bands along specific directions. The results are explained using a simple model based on the competition between diffusion and reaction rates at different locations within the sample. This work provides new insights into how chemical systems may self-organize through interactions with their environment. Chemical systems often exhibit complex spatial structures such as stripes or rings which form spontaneously without any externally imposed symmetry breaking  1  .

We find that the horizontal flow pattern consists of two counter-rotating cells which are connected to each other through a narrow channel along their common boundary. This structure resembles the magnetic topology of a bipolar sunspot pair. In addition we observe a small-scale vortex-like feature located on one side of the central upflow region.

We say that the horizontal flow pattern means of two counter - rotating cells which are connected to each other through a narrow flow along their common border . This system follows the magnetic configuration of a bipolar sunspot couple . In addition we witness a small - level vortex - like feature located on one side of the main upflow region .

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Electron Doping of Cuprates via Interfaces with Manganites .\nAbstract:\nWe report on the observation of electron doping in cuprate superconductors by interfacing them to manganite insulators through epitaxial growth and chemical bonding at interfaces.  The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers  1  . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity  2  . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory  3  , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc  4  .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value  5  . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane  6  . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system  7, 8  . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3  9  or LaAlO3  10  onto the surface of cuprate superconductors.

We show that this system has two different types of droplets: small ones are similar to those found in other models studied previously; large droplets are characterized by their fractal structure. The latter type can be viewed as a generalization of the droplet picture proposed earlier for the 3D Ising spin glasses. In addition we find that there exists another class of excitations -the so-called  giant droplets -which are not present in any of these systems. These giant droplets are responsible for the non-universal behavior observed numerically near the critical point. Finally, we argue that our results provide strong numerical support for the existence of a new phase transition line between the paramagnetic state and the spin-glass one. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe concept of  droplet excitations  was introduced originally within the framework of the mean-field theory  1  . It describes how local perturbations affect global properties of the system. This idea turned out to be very useful when applied to various disordered systems such as spin glasses  2  , structural glasses  3  or vortex lattices  4  .\nIn particular it allowed to explain many features of the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin glasses  5  . However, despite its successes, the original droplet picture suffers from some serious drawbacks  6  : first, it does not take into account fluctuations around the saddle-point solution  7 ; secondly, it predicts a finite density of droplets even at T = 0  8  ; thirdly, it cannot describe properly the dynamics of the system  9  . To overcome these difficulties several modifications were suggested  10  . One of them  11  leads to the following expression for the free energy F(T ) per site: \nwhere f0 is the free-energy density of the reference system (e.g., the pure ferromagnet), Ns is the total number of spins, V is the volume occupied by each droplet",

We present results from N-body simulations that show how collisions among planetesimals in Neptune s feeding zone can produce objects with orbits similar to those observed today. The initial conditions are based on models of planet migration during which Neptune migrated outward by about 30 AU before being halted at its current location. Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper belt formed as a result of collisional grinding between bodies whose sizes were comparable to Pluto (r ~ 1000 km). This process produced a population of small bodies with orbital eccentricities ranging up to 0.3. Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these bodies to be scattered into highly eccentric orbits.

The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.   The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.   The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.    This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.  It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.  In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.  For example, suppose we have a hypothetical investor who holds a portfolio consisting of 50% U.S. Treasury bills and 50% Standard & Poor’s 500 Index Funds.

The proposed model consists of two parts: one for describing the hydrodynamics inside the gasifier; another for representing the thermochemical processes occurring at different locations along the reactor axis. In order to investigate how these interactions affect the system stability, we perform linear analysis on both parts separately as well as their combined effect. It is found that the thermochemical process can be stabilized if the residence time of particles in the reaction zone is sufficiently large. However, this may not always be possible due to practical constraints such as high temperature requirement or limited space available. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using realistic operating conditions to verify our theoretical results. Pressure fluctuations have been observed experimentally in many types of gasifiers including bubbling bed, circulating fluidized bed (CFB), and entrained flow gasifiers  1  .

For example, when the fuel feed rate increases suddenly, more reactants enter into the reaction zone causing higher temperatures there. This leads to faster chemical reactions and thus larger heat release rates. As a result, the local pressure rises rapidly.

This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Geometry of Time, Axiom of Choice and Neuro-Biological Quantum Zeno Effect .\nAbstract:\nThe geometry of time is the study of how space-time evolves in time.  The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time  1  . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski  2  who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions.

Title : Geometry of Time , Axiom of Choice and Neuro - Biological Quantum Zeno Effect . Abstract : The geometry of time is the investigation of how space - time evolves in time . The axiom of choice states that for any system of anti - filled sets there exists at least one setting which contains necessarily one element from each setting . In this section we show that if the world has an intrinsic quantum system then it follows that the dynamics of time can be described by using the axiom of selection to select a discrete point on every path through spacetime . We also discuss some could implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno influence could play a role in understanding different details of cerebral system such as mind . The geometry of time is the mathematical expression of how space - time evolutes over time 1 . It was first introduced into science by Hermann Minkowski 2 who showed that the map of matter - matter could be represented by four digits ( x , y , z , t ) called coordinates or co - ordinates . These are similar by the following expression : x2 + y2 - z2 - t2 = ( c ^ 2 ) ( 1 - ( v / c ) ) 1 / 2 Where k means the speed of light and v gives the speed of the object being seen . This example relates the correlation between distance walked along the x - component , y - component , z - plane and t - line respectively . For example , if you were observing someone creeping across your living room room with their side towards you they would have a good value for the x - side but no values for the other three directions because they are not falling in those directions . If therefore you were watching them walk away from you they must have negative values for all three coordinates except the x - plane since they are also travelling forward in that path . As another example consider two things traveling side - by - side down a motorway . They will both go at the same speed so their velocities will be equal . However , if one road goes north while the other goes south they will seem to move faster than each other otherwise though they are traveling at the same speed .",

The exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear; however it has been suggested that pulsations play a key role.  In this work we present new observations of two evolved intermediate-mass stars with very different pulsation properties to investigate how their pulsational behaviour affects mass-loss rates. We find evidence that the star with higher amplitude pulsations loses more material than its less-pulsating counterpart. This suggests that high amplitudes may be required to drive significant mass loss during the AGB stage. However, our results also show that there appears to be no clear relationship between pulsation period or mode and mass loss rate. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of low-metallicity stars as well as the formation of planetary nebulae.",

It was formulated by Einstein et al., who claimed that it could be solved only if there existed hidden variables which were not included in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. The original EPR argument has been criticized on several grounds including its reliance upon an unjustified assumption about locality. In this work we reexamine the EPR experiment using modern techniques for measuring correlations between photons produced via parametric down-conversion (PDC). We show how to measure all relevant quantities needed to test Bell s theorem with PDC sources. Our results are consistent with those predicted by quantum mechanics but do not violate any known bounds on nonlocality. This suggests that the original EPR argument may have been flawed or incomplete. Quantum entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from condensed matter systems to high energy particle collisions. However, despite decades of research into the foundations of quantum mechanics, the exact nature of quantum entanglement remains elusive.

We find that this method will not work with current technology because it requires very accurate measurements of pulse arrival times over many years. However, we show how future radio telescopes could make such measurements if they are equipped with new technologies like phased-array feeds or digital backends. In addition, we discuss other possible methods using pulsar timing data to search for gravitational waves. Gravitational waves cause time delays between pulses emitted at different points on the surface of a rotating neutron star. These time delays depend on the distance between these points as well as their position relative to the line-of-sight towards the observer. The most prominent effects occur when the wave passes close to the Earth and its companion stars. This causes an additional delay known as the Shapiro effect  Shapiro 1964  . If one knows the positions of all pulsars within a globular cluster, then one can use the observed pulse arrival times to measure the distances between them.

In addition , we obtain that the slope variable L ( ρ0 ) , characterizing the density dependence of atomic incompressibility K∞ = 9L ( ρ0 ) ( 3π2ρ0 / 40MeV ) 2 , drops rapidly as thermal advances for both pure magnetic matter and symmetric atomic matter . This means that the stiffness of atomic matter becomes weaker at large heats . We also obtain the stress P , entropy S and specific heat Cv of atomic matter as dependent of baryonic number density nB and temperature T .",

The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes in order to improve lifetime performance. In particular, the source node first transmits data packets using its maximum power level. Then, it switches to lower power levels if no packet has been successfully received within a certain time period. If one or more packets are successfully decoded, then the source node increases its transmit power back up to the previous value. We derive closed-form expressions for outage probability as well as average throughput under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that our proposed scheme can significantly increase network lifetime compared to conventional schemes without compromising system reliability.

We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*. For times larger than t* the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial condition and coincides with the one predicted by classical mean field theories.

In attempt to prove our selection algorithms we compare them against simulated stellar groups retrieved from N - ship simulations . Our main results are as follows:  1. Using the matched filter technique we obtain that the number density of cluster regions at z < 0 . 5 is n ( z < 0 . 5 ) = 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 x 10 - 3 h3 Mpc - 3 . This value goes good with previous determinations using other techniques . 2. By using the same mixed filter technique to simulated cluster regions we show how this method can be used to estimate the mass value of galaxy regions up to z ~ 1 . 0 .",

In addition we find that the fraction of blue cloud galaxies increases towards higher redshifts up to z~2.5-3.0, while it decreases again beyond this epoch. This trend can be explained by the fact that most massive galaxies have already formed stars before z~3, so they become redder than less-massive ones afterwards; therefore more massive galaxies dominate the red-sequence population at high-z.

Finally, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the unstable modes it becomes evident that they tend to localize near regions where there exist structural defects such as icosahedral-like motifs.

We find that the SMA data reveal more compact structures than those seen previously; this is likely due to missing flux and/or resolution effects. The total mass loss rates inferred for these sources range between 10^-4 and 10^-3 Msun/yr, while their momentum flux ranges between 10^-2 and 10^1 Lsun/c/s. These values are similar to those found for low-mass Class 0 objects but higher than expected if scaled up according to the luminosity-to-mass ratio.

Here we propose that graphene can be used as such material by exploiting its unique electronic structure. We show how this leads to a novel type of spin transistor which operates at room temperature without external magnetic fields or applied gate voltages. The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic contacts connected via a single layer of graphene. By applying a voltage between these contacts one can control the SOC strength in the graphene channel leading to a change in the transmission probability through it. This results in a switching behavior similar to conventional transistors. In addition, our analysis shows that the proposed device exhibits high on/off ratios even when operating under realistic conditions.

This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields.

The results show that ER decreases with increasing temperature for all samples while R H increases with decreasing temperature. It is found that both silver and indium doping decrease T C , increase J c and enhance pinning force density F p .

These results are explained by considering different effects of silver and indium ions on the microstructure as well as their influence on oxygen vacancies concentration.

The structural parameters such as lattice constant, unit cell volume and bond length were calculated from XRD data. The dc magnetization measurements reveal that Curie temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and pinning force density (Fp) decrease with increasing amount of silver or indium content.",

Title : Inter comparison of the magneto transport of La2 / 3Ca1 / 3MnO3 : Ag / In polycrystalline composites . Abstract : The influence of metal and indium on the magnetic structures , electrical resistivity ( ER ) and Hall coefficient ( R H ) has been explored in La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 Mn O 3 . The results show that ER falls with increasing temperature for all data while R H increases with varying cooling . It is found that both metal and indium doping decrease T C , increase J g and increase pinning force density F P . Silver doped sample shows higher values of J c than indium doped one at lowest grades but smaller value at large ranges . These results are described by considering different impacts of metal and indium concentrations on the microstructure as also as their influence on oxygen vacancies content .

We show that there are two different ways how one can define this quantity depending on whether or not one takes into account the back-reaction effects due to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. The first approach leads to an expression for the semiclassical propagator which coincides with the Feynman propagator at large distances but differs significantly near the source point. In particular it does not satisfy the Hadamard condition required by general relativity. On the other hand, if we take into account the back reaction then the resulting expression satisfies all necessary conditions including the Hadamard condition. However, as was shown recently by Wald et al., such an expression cannot be obtained within the framework of standard QFT. This problem may have important consequences when considering the propagation of particles through black holes since the corresponding expressions differ substantially even outside the horizon.",

In this work, we perform large-scale quantum transport simulations on GNR-FETs by solving the nonequilibrium Green s function equations within an effective mass approximation. We find that the subthreshold swing decreases rapidly when the channel length is reduced below 10 nm while it increases slowly beyond 20 nm. The ON/OFF current ratio also shows similar trends but its value becomes saturated around 100 nm.

However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are extremely narrow compared to those of normal radio",

We use two different sets of evolutionary tracks with varying Y values for masses between 0.8 M⊙ and 8 M⊙ at solar metallicity. The first set is based on the Padova code while the second one uses the Geneva code. For each track we calculate synthetic spectra using the SPECTRUM code. These synthetic spectra are then used as input to determine the best-fit parameters of observed high-resolution optical spectra of Galactic open clusters. Our analysis shows that both codes produce similar results when fitting these cluster data. However, there are significant differences in the derived ages depending on which code was used. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Padova tracks have been calculated without convective overshooting whereas the Geneva tracks include this effect.",

String/M-theory  1  , Loop Quantum Gravity  2  are two examples of these efforts. However, despite their successes they still suffer from some problems. For instance, string/M-theory requires extra dimensions  3  while loop quantum gravity suffers from non-renormalizability  4  . These difficulties motivate us to look for alternative approaches towards developing TOEs. Recently, a novel approach called  emergent spacetime  was proposed  5, 6  . According to this approach, space-time emerges from a more fundamental level  7, 8  .\nEmergent spacetime:-The idea behind emergent spacetime is very simple. It states that space-time is not fundamental but rather emerges from a more fundamental entity. To see why this might happen consider the following argument. Imagine you are sitting on your couch watching TV. You will probably say that the world around you looks flat because if you were standing up then you would notice that the ground below you is curved. Now imagine yourself floating above Earth.

In this talk I will present some results on the statistical mechanics of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. The main focus will be on the phase transitions associated with the appearance/disappearance of giant connected components (GCC) in these graphs. We show how to calculate exactly the probability distribution function for GCC size using generating functions techniques. This allows us to study analytically the effect of various parameters like average connectivity, clustering coefficient, node degrees etc., on the formation of GCCs. Finally we discuss possible applications of our results to problems related to epidemic spreading on networks. The statistical mechanics of networks is one of the most active areas of research today. It was pioneered by Barabasi-Albert who discovered that many real world networks have power law degree distributions  1  . Since then there has been considerable interest in understanding the statistical mechanical behavior of different classes of networks  2  .\nIn particular it has been shown recently  3  , that the presence or absence of a giant component (GC), which contains a finite fraction of all nodes in the graph, can lead to interesting phase transitions.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been introduced more than 50 years ago  1  . It describes a ferromagnetic material where each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbors via exchange interactions J ij , while it also feels an external magnetic field h i randomly oriented on different sites  2  .\nIn recent years there have been many studies devoted to this problem both experimentally  3  -  6  and theoretically  7  -  12  . This interest was triggered mainly by the fact that the RFIM shares some features with real systems such as diluted antiferromagnets or spin-glasses  13  -  15  . For example, the presence of quenched disorder leads to frustration effects  16  similar to those observed in spin-glass materials  17  . Moreover, the RFIM displays a rich variety of phases depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field  18  . At low fields one finds a paramagnetic phase, whereas above a certain threshold value H c = O(J), the spins align along the direction of the local magnetic field leading to a ferromagnetic state  19  . Finally, if the magnitude of the external field exceeds another threshold value H t > H c , the magnetization becomes discontinuous  20  .

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS The Random Field Ising Model ( RFIM ) has been introduced more than 50 people ago 1 . It states a ferromagnetic matter where each magnetic interacts only with its nearest associates via exchange interactions J ij , while it also feels an external magnetic field h i randomly centered on different sites 2 . In subsequent years there have been numerous experiments devoted to this problem both experimentally 3 - 6 and theoretically 7 - 12 . This interest was triggered mainly by the fact that the RFIM faces some features with actual systems such as diluted antiferromagnets or magnetic - frames 13 - 15 . For example , the presence of quenched behavior gives to anger feelings 16 similar to those seen in spin - glass materials 17 . Moreover , the RFIM exhibits a rich variety of phases depending on the intensity of the applied magnetic field 18 . At small fields one finds a paramagnetic charge , whereas above a specified limit value H c = O ( J ) , the spins align along the path of the surrounding magnetic field giving to a ferromagnetic field 19 . Finally , if the intensity of the external field exceeds another limit value H t > H c , the magnetization becomes discontinuous 20 . These three regimes are divided by two second - line phases occurring at T c1 < 0 and T c2 > 0 21 . However , despite these analogies between the RFIM and observed systems 22 , the exact nature of the phase diagram remains controversial 23 .",

The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) . It has been suggested that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during different stages of evolution of molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). \n \n Recent observational studies have shown that many young massive stars are associated with filamentary structures observed in infrared dust emission maps (André et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2013 ). These filaments often appear to be aligned along magnetic field directions inferred from polarisation measurements (Chapman et al. 2011) , suggesting that magnetic fields might play an important role in regulating the dynamics of such systems. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields can affect the stability properties of self-gravitating clouds against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomis",

The preliminary results are made on observations of adjacent star - creating regions . We say that shock compression results to an increase in density and heating at the post - shock region . This causes the gas force slope across the shock front to decline rapidly as life continues . As a result , the field rows become more twisted due to flow dynamics caused by the shock wave .

The same relationship holds true for repulsive gravity as well.   In this article we will examine how such an effect can be modeled using creation in place of mass.    Creation is defined by Einstein s field equations as:  G = 8πG/c4T00 where T00 represents the energy density of space-time.  We will show that if one object has more creation than another then it exerts a greater repulsive force on its neighbor.   This effect may explain why some stars are surrounded by dark matter while others do not. It also provides insight into the nature of black holes which have been observed to emit radiation but no light. Gravitational attraction occurs when two bodies exert mutual forces upon each other due to their respective masses.  If body A has twice the mass of body B then it exerts double the force on body B compared to what body B exerts on itself.  Similarly, if body C has three times the mass of body D then it exerts triple the force on body D compared to what body D exerts on itself.  Force is measured in newtons (N) or dynes (dyne).",

Abstract : We investigate the electrical excitation of nonlinear currents in a 2D system with an applied voltage bias between two connected metal plates divided by a dielectric film . We show that , depending on the parameters of the system ( the thickness of the dielectric surface , the density of carriers ) , different forms of nonlinear currents can be excited . In specifically , we find that for small values of these parameters small wave solutions exist which are similar to those found earlier in 1D systems . The name of such reflection beams is confirmed experimentally using time - discrete optical reflectivity observations conducted at room cooling on crystals comprised of GaAs / AlGaAs quantum wells grown by molecular wave epitaxy . These experiments reveal the presence of bright small signals propagating along the path opposite to the applied electric field . Their propagation velocities comply good with theoretical predictions using on numerical simulations of the basis equations . The results shown here could have key applied in semiconductor devices where it has been shown recently that the generation of small signals gives to superior performance features .",

The model takes into account both electron-phonon scattering processes that lead to spin dephasing as well as phonon-assisted tunneling between localized states near the Fermi level.

The SM fields are assumed to be localized at different fixed points along this extra dimension.

Finally we discuss how our results could be tested experimentally. Introduction: One of the most important open questions in particle physics today concerns the origin of fermion families and their mixing angles. It has been known since the work by Pati & Salam  1  , that if quarks and leptons were unified into larger multiplets then it would be possible to understand the pattern of quark-lepton masses and mixings within Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). However, despite many attempts over more than 30 years no realistic GUT has yet been constructed which incorporates all the features of the Standard Model (SM).\nIn recent years another possibility was suggested  2  -  4  : If the SM fields live in higher dimensional space-time, they may have Kaluza-Klein excitations corresponding to additional states with masses of order 1/R, where R denotes the size of the extra dimensions. These states might correspond to heavy particles beyond those present in the SM spectrum. This idea leads to interesting phenomenological consequences  5  .\nThe simplest way to realize this scenario is to assume that only gravity propagates in the bulk while the SM fields are confined to a four-dimensional  brane   6  . Such theories lead to corrections to the Newtonian potential between two test masses m 1 and m 2 separated by distance r given by: \nwhere M P l = 1/ √ 8πG N ≈ 10 19 GeV is the reduced Planck scale and n i counts the number of extra spatial dimensions accessible to field i.

The resulting quantum theories have many interesting features including nontrivial anomalies and non-perturbative effects such as instantons.    In particular we find that the partition functions for these models are closely related to automorphic forms on the corresponding groups; this is known as the Langlands correspondence between representations of the two groups.   This provides a new perspective on the relationship between gauge theory and string theory; it also suggests a possible connection between the Standard Model and M-theory. Solitons play important roles in physics ranging from condensed matter to particle and nuclear physics. They appear naturally in various physical contexts where nonlinear interactions occur, e.g., in fluid dynamics or field theories describing particles interacting via Yukawa potentials (e.g., quarks). A particularly rich class of solitonic solutions arises when one considers integrable systems whose equations of motion admit Lax pairs.

The QD emission line splits into two components with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to about 1 T, which corresponds to the Zeeman splitting energy of 0.5 meV at 4 K.

Quantum dot (QD), also known as semiconductor nanocrystal or artificial atom, has attracted much attention due to its unique physical properties such as size-tunable band gap  1  , strong confinement effect  2  , and large oscillator strength  3  .

The main spiral turn - off value occurs around K = 14 . 5 mag , indicating an age between 5 and 7 Gyrs . This positions it among the ancient open groups known . Using our data we obtain a average metallicity Fe / H = - 1 . 3 x 0 . 1 dex . From this value and using theoretical models we estimate the mass of the most massive star in the cluster as Mmax = 120 - [UNK] . In addition , we have acquired deep imaging photographs with HST / ACS / WFC2 covering the central region of the cluster . These reveal numerous dozen very bright members within a distance of only 20 arcsec .",

The method is based on wavelet transforms in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). It allows us to separate different types of variability into their individual components at each point in time. We find that there are two distinct modes of solar magnetic field evolution over this period. One mode shows strong fluctuations around a mean value which varies slowly but significantly during the cycle 23/24 minimum. This behaviour can be explained as being due to the presence of large-scale dynamo waves driven by differential rotation. In addition we identify another type of variation which appears to have no preferred frequency or spatial scale. These variations show significant correlations with sunspot number and other proxies for solar activity.

We show how this scenario can be realized in string theory with an explicit example based on type IIB orientifolds compactified to four dimensions on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular we find that there are many possible realizations of such models which lead to realistic values for the cosmological parameters. The model is consistent with all current experimental constraints including those coming from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as from direct searches at colliders.

The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle:  Highly turbulent solutions of LANS-alpha and their LES potential .\nAbstract:\nWe present highly resolved numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the LANS-alpha model, which is known to produce good results for wall-bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades  1, 2  . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems  3–5  , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models  6  .\nIn recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged  7–10  .

Abstract : We create strongly precise numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations with the LANS - alpha model , which is good to produce good results for wall - density systems at small Reynolds values . We show that this method can also be used in large - Reynolds number circumstances where it produces accurate results albeit though its intrinsic results are not accepted today . The main benefit over standard LES techniques lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid - level models have to be introduced . This gives the alternative very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as necessary by other LES approaches . In addition we prove how the LANS - alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme using on the variational multiscale formulation ( VMS - LES ) to obtain more effective computations . Finally , we discuss some common topics concerning to the using of these schemes in useful purposes . Turbulence plays a key role in numerous physical observations including from climate prediction to oceanic circulation and fire systems .

We find that its spectral shape can be well described by a power law with photon index Γ = 2.1 ± 0.2 plus two thermal components; one component has temperature kT = 0.3 +0.4 −0.1 keV while another has higher temperature kT = 3.7 +1.6 −1.1 keV. The luminosity ratio between these two thermal components is L h /L l ≈ 5.9 +2.8 −2.1 .

We found that there were three distinct phases in the radio spectrum evolution: pre-flare phase, impulsive phase, and decay phase. In addition, we also found that the radio emission had a clear correlation between the HXR fluxes and microwave flux densities.

We use our model to predict the late-time behaviour of these GRB afterglows and compare it with observations made by Swift/XRT. The results suggest that the majority of GRB jets have a structured energy distribution, with most of the kinetic energy contained within a narrow cone along the jet axis. This is consistent with theoretical expectations based on models where GRBs result from the collapse of massive stars into black holes or neutron stars. \nIntroduction\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Piran 2004 , Gehrels et al. 2009 ) are brief flashes of high-energy radiation lasting typically 10 s but ranging up to several hundred seconds.

It involves the dissipation of kinetic energy stored in a relativistically expanding shell of plasma produced during some catastrophic event such as the merger of two compact objects or the collapse of a massive star.

Title:  The Maximal Amount of Gravitational Waves in the Curvaton Scenario . Abstract : We research gravitational currents produced by curvaton scenario , where the inflaton field is coupled to another scalar field called curvaton which decays into background after inflation and produces primordial density fluctuations . We prove that the amplitude of gravitational currents generated during inflation can be augmented if the decay rate of curvaton is large sufficient compared with Hubble factor at its decay rate . In this fact we show that the metric - to - scalar factor becomes larger than 0 . 1 for most values of parameters except when the weight of curvaton is very small or the interactions between inflaton and curvaton fields are extremely weakly . This result could give an reason on why the latest observations give such a large value of tensor - to - scalar value . Introduction The latest observational data 1 strongly suggest that there exists a considerable excess of primordial gravitational currents ( GWs ) in our world . If confirmed , it will have key implications not only for cosmology but also cosmic science 2 . However , the source of these GWs has been one of the biggest puzzles in modern cosmology 3 . In help to explain the experimental thermal anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , numerous models beyond standard model of cosmic field were proposed 4 , among them supersymmetric grand unification models 5 and supergravity 6 are also famous instance . These models predict fresh particles whose values lie around 10 16 GeV 7 , 8 . It was shown 9 that the existence of such heavy matter could lead to effective inflationary scenarios 10 . On the other hand , the presence of such heavy interactions must produce too much gravitons 11 unless their couplings to ordinary matter are strongly subdued 12 . Therefore , it appeared hard to produce sufficient excess of GWs within the context of these models without conflicting with CMB observation 13 . Recently , however , numerous authors 14 - 17 indicated that the production of GWs could be achieved field though the inflaton does not couple directly to any heavy interactions .

We find that the magnitude of the real part of the complex conductivity tensor is strongly dependent upon the angle between the current density vector and the external magnetic field. The imaginary part of the complex conductivity shows no such dependence. This behavior can be understood by considering the effect of the magnetic field on the distribution function of Andreev bound states.

For example, it was recently shown experimentally  5  , that when a dc bias voltage Vdc = 0 is applied across a Josephson junction array (JJA), the system exhibits hysteretic switching between two different resistive states which occur at critical values of the amplitude of the alternating current Vac. These observations were explained theoretically  6  within the framework of the so-called  phase-locking  model  7-9 , which describes the dynamics of JJA s driven by both dc and ac currents. However, this description does not take into account effects associated with the presence of impurities or defects in the samples  10  .\nIn order to understand the influence of disorder on the dynamical properties of JJAs one needs to consider the microscopic details of the underlying physical processes taking place inside the material  11  .

We find that, in agreement with previous studies, evaporation causes GCs to lose stars preferentially on their low-mass end and thus steepens the MF slope towards lower masses. However, we show that this effect is counteracted by two competing processes: dynamical friction which removes massive stars more efficiently than less massive ones; and relaxation-driven core collapse which increases the central density of the cluster and makes it harder for massive stars to escape. The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs. This suggests that other processes are required to explain the shape of the observed MF.

We find that both microand macro-rheology are consistent with an elastic network model for which we can extract values for the number density of links between filaments as well as their stiffness. The results show that increasing the concentration of avidin leads to denser networks with stiffer links. This effect is more pronounced when the initial concentration of actin filaments is higher. Our findings suggest that the mechanical properties of actomyosin gels may be tunable through changes in the amount and/or type of crosslinks present within these systems. In living cells, cytoskeletal structures such as stress fibers or focal adhesions provide physical connections between cell components and play important roles in determining cellular mechanics  1  .

We prove that both microand macro - rheology are consistent with an elastic system model for which we can obtain values for the number density of connections between filaments as also as their stiffness . The results show that increasing the presence of avidin gives to denser networks with stiffer connections . This increase is more pronounced when the first density of actin filaments is higher . Our findings suggest that the mechanical behavior of actomyosin gels could be tunable through changes in the number and / or type of crosslinks found within these systems . In living cells , cytoskeletal structures such as stress fibers or cell adhesions play physical connections between cell components and play key positions in determining cell mechanics 1 . These structures comprise of bundles of semiflexible biopolymers called as actin filaments 2 , which are connected together via modified expression structures called crosslinks 3 . In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how the mechanical structures of biological structures depend on the microscopic behavior of the biological networks 4 . For example, it was shown recently that the viscoelasticity of reconstituted actomyosin gels depends strongly on the presence of myosins  5  . However , despite this progress our knowledge about the correlation between the macroscopic behavior of complex fluids and the microstructure of the constituent built components continues restricted 6 .",

The SAM consists of octadecanethiols with an end group that contains either one or two thiocyanates, which are known to form strong dipole moments upon adsorption onto gold substrates. We find that the presence of these strongly polarizable groups leads to significant changes in the electronic structure of the SAM compared to nonpolar alkane chains. In particular, we observe a shift of the molecular states towards higher energies as well as a reduction of their spatial extension perpendicular to the surface. These effects can be explained within a simple model based on electrostatic interactions between the molecules and the substrate. Our results demonstrate how chemical functionalization allows for tailoring the properties of organic films deposited on metallic surfaces. Dipole formation at interfaces of alkanethiolate self-assembled monolay- ers and Ag(111) has been studied using scanning tunneling microscopy/ spectroscopy (STM/S). The SAM was prepared by chemisorption of octadecanethiol containing thiocyanate endgroups on Ag(111), resulting in a film with a large dipole moment per unit area.

The data are consistent with theoretical predictions that such emissions should be produced by particles accelerated near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole located there.   This is the first time this phenomenon has been observed outside our own Galaxy and it opens up new opportunities for studying particle acceleration processes around black holes. Black holes are among the most exotic objects known to science. They have no surface or edge but instead exist as singularities where space-time ends. In addition they exert enormous gravitational forces so that even light cannot escape their grasp. However, despite these extreme conditions, some scientists believe that matter can still be accelerated close to the speed of light inside the so-called  event horizons  surrounding black holes. Such high energy phenomena could produce extremely energetic photons called  TeV gammas  - short for Tera-Electron-Volt photons. These would then be detectable using ground-based telescopes like those used by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).

The model is based on the concept of self-assembly as it occurs during the formation of biological macromolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. We show how this process leads to the spontaneous appearance of functional units which we call  gene families . Gene families are defined by common sequence motifs and can be seen as building blocks for more complex organisms. In our approach, these building blocks evolve into new species through mutations and selection processes. Species interact with each other via chemical reactions mediated by enzymes. These interactions lead to the formation of metabolic networks whose structure reflects the underlying network topology of the interacting species. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed model reproduces several important features observed in real-world systems including preferential attachment, scale-free degree distributions and small world properties.

In particular we find that the current data is consistent with a flat universe dominated by dark energy (w = -1), but inconsistent with models where w > -0.8 or w < -2/3 at 95% confidence level. This result agrees well with previous analyses based on other techniques. \n \n The results presented here are derived from the WMAP 5-year temperature map  1  , combined with measurements of galaxy clustering  2  .

In this study we have investigated these properties using alkanol monolayers on an aqueous subphase as model systems to mimic the hydrocarbon chains present in crude oils. The results show that the vapor pressures of the alkanols increase with chain length up to C8 but decrease again above C10. This is explained by considering the competition between two opposing effects:  On one hand, increasing chain lengths lead to higher molecular volumes which favor evaporation. On the other hand, longer chains also result in stronger van der Waals interactions within the liquid phase leading to lower vapor pressures. We find that the solubilities of the alkanols follow similar trends as those observed for the vapor pressures. However, the differences in solubility among different chain lengths become smaller when compared to the corresponding differences in vapor pressure.

The PVD are compared to those expected by models that include both rotation and radial motions. We find that our data can be explained if we assume that the emission comes from a ring-like structure located between 0.1 AU and 1 AU from the central star.

We find that the interface moves as a whole when it is driven slowly enough; otherwise, it breaks into several segments which move independently. The number of segments increases with increasing driving frequency or decreasing temperature. In addition to these two regimes, we observe another regime where the interface exhibits stick-slip motion.

For this regime, we show that there exists a scaling relation between the average velocity V , the driving frequency f , and the driving amplitude A: V ∝ Af 2 .
