Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of the SM, offers a compelling solution to the hierarchy problem. However, SUSY models face significant constraints from the properties of superpartners. To address these challenges, several authors have proposed various approaches, including the introduction of additional gauge symmetries and the incorporation of extra dimensions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that there exists a class of string-inspired models in which the lightest superpartner is a gravitino. The gravitino, being a spin-3/2 particle, has a decay rate that is significantly different from that of the neutralino. This characteristic makes the gravitino a viable candidate for dark matter. Furthermore, if the gravitino mass is less than 1 GeV, its decay becomes more favorable than that of other candidates. Thus, the gravitino could serve as a compelling candidate for dark matter. Additionally, the gravitino interacts primarily through gravity, decaying into photons or lepton-neutrino pairs. If the gravitino mass exceeds 100 MeV, its decay products will be detectable as diffuse gamma rays. Consequently, the gravitino must satisfy specific criteria to be considered a viable dark matter candidate.",

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening. In particular we find that for small values of the QD size dispersion there exists a critical value of the growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be formed.

In this process, QDs form spontaneously and arrange themselves into regular patterns. Our findings indicate that the ordering of QDs is influenced by two competing factors: surface diffusion and strain relaxation. The former tends to increase the density of QDs, while the latter promotes their spatial organization. Notably, we observe that for larger distributions of QD sizes, there exists a critical growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be achieved. This insight helps explain the challenges encountered in producing ordered QD arrays with larger sizes using conventional methods. \n\nKeywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy \n\n1. Introduction \nSemiconductor nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant attention due to their unique optical properties. They are utilized in various optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors, and they also play crucial roles in biological applications. The most widely used method for growing QDs is the Stranski-Krastanov technique, which involves depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate at high temperatures, followed by annealing at lower temperatures. During this process, QDs nucleate across the entire sample area and subsequently evolve into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening. However, this technique does not allow for precise control over the sizes of individual QDs within each array. Recently developed methods have enabled the production of highly ordered QD arrays, but they require very precise temperature control during deposition. \n\n2.

The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations.

One intriguing framework is the seesaw mechanism, where SM singlet right-handed neutrinos acquire large Majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking. To determine whether the observed neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, one can search for lepton number-violating processes mediated by virtual heavy neutrinos. These processes include neutrinoless double beta decay, tritium beta decay, and charged-current quasielastic interactions. However, all these processes face significant astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties. In contrast, colliders offer a clean environment to investigate lepton number violation.

        "original_text": "We present the theory behind relativistic fluctuation theorems, which are exact relations between entropy production in nonequilibrium processes and fluctuations in equilibrium states. We show that these results can be derived using only standard statistical mechanics techniques applied to systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking interactions. In particular we derive an expression for the entropy production rate in terms of correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. This result is used to calculate the entropy production rates associated with several simple models including Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, and driven harmonic oscillators. Finally, we discuss how our approach may be extended beyond classical physics. Relativistic fluctuation theorems provide exact relations between entropy production during non-equilibrium processes and fluctuations in corresponding equilibrium states. These results have been obtained by applying standard statistical mechanics methods to systems with broken timereversal invariance. Here we use this formalism to obtain expressions for the entropy production rate as well as other quantities such as heat currents in terms of correlation functions evaluated at thermal equilibrium. As concrete applications we consider several simple models including Browninan motion, Langevin dynamics and driven harmonic oscillators. \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Entropy production plays a central role in many areas of science ranging from biology  1  , chemistry  2  , geophysics  3  , and neuroscience  4  . It has also become increasingly important in quantum information processing  5  where it provides a measure of irreversibility  6  . Despite its importance there remains no general method for calculating entropy production rates except in very special cases  7–9  . Recently, however, new theoretical tools based on fluctuation theorems  10–12  have emerged which allow one to relate entropy production directly to measurable properties of physical systems  13–18  .

Introduction\nEntropy plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, including biology, geophysics, and neuroscience. Its significance has grown in recent years, particularly in the context of understanding irreversibility. Despite its importance, there is no general method for calculating entropy production except in a few specific cases. Recently, research based on fluctuation theorems has emerged, allowing for a connection between entropy production and measurable properties of systems. In particular, there has been significant interest in developing experimental techniques capable of measuring entropy production rates in real-time, enabling direct tests of fundamental thermodynamic principles and potentially leading to practical devices for harnessing work from thermal fluctuations. \n\n2.

Introduction\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of computing devices such as laptops, PDAs, and smartphones, there has been an increasing interest in providing high-quality services over wireless local area networks (WLANs). However, due to the limited resources available in WLANs, efficient resource management has become critically important. The most commonly used medium access control protocol in current WLAN implementations is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which facilitates contention-based channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and provides contention-free service via Point Coordinated Function (PCF). While CSMA/CA allows multiple stations to share the same channel simultaneously without explicit coordination, it suffers from performance degradation as the number of active stations increases. This issue is primarily caused by hidden node problems, where two stations attempt to transmit packets to each other simultaneously, resulting in collisions. To mitigate these issues, several approaches have been proposed. Among them, one notable method is the Reservation Channel (VRC), which aims to reduce interference among data transmissions from different stations. A modified version of VRC has also been introduced to further enhance the performance of CSMA/CA under heavy load conditions. However, all these approaches assume a fixed number of active stations within the network.",

Additionally, we find that the entropy profiles of our simulated cluster population can replicate the observed profiles within their scatter. Nonetheless, there are notable differences between individual simulated clusters and real observations, which may be attributed to non-gravitational effects such as AGN feedback.",

The OT was observed at an R magnitude of 16.7 and later at 14.6, with a rise time of approximately one day. It is situated near the core of M85, one of the closest galaxies to our own Milky Way. We note that this event exhibits several characteristics similar to those of Type Ia supernovae, yet it lacks the typical spectroscopic features associated with these phenomena. This suggests that we may be observing a different type of explosion, potentially related to other transient events such as tidal disruption flares or superluminous supernovae. \n\n**Keywords:** Supernova, Optical transient, PTF, Tidal disruption flare, Bright optical transient\n\n**Introduction**  \nIn recent years, there have been numerous instances of exceptionally luminous optical transients linked to nearby galaxies. Notable examples include the well-known eruptions of Eta Carinae (Davidson & Humphreys 1997; Smith et al. 1998), SN 2005ap (Gal-Yam et al. 2005; Foley et al. 2007), ASASSN-14li (Holoien et al. 2014a), ATLAS14aaq (Dong et al. 2015), PS1-10jh (Gezari et al. 2012), iPTF16axa (Kasliwal et al. 2016), and ASASSN-15oi (Shappee et al. 2016). Many of these events have been associated with supermassive black holes in galactic centers. However, their precise nature remains uncertain. Some researchers have proposed that these phenomena could be the result of tidal disruptions of stars by black holes (TDE) (Komossa 2002; Gezari et al. 2009a; Bloom et al. 2011; Holoien et al. 2013b; Arcavi et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2017), while others suggest they may represent manifestations of thermonuclear explosions (SNe Ia-like) (Valenti et al. 2009; Kasliwal et al. 2016).",

This has been interpreted as evidence of asymmetry in these events, potentially caused by strong magnetic fields or rapid rotation. However, it remains uncertain whether either factor alone could produce such highly polarized light curves. In this study, we explore how the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields influences the outcomes of accretion-induced collapse (AIC), where a white dwarf collapses into a neutron star. To conduct this investigation, we employ two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code. Our initial models consist of rigidly rotating white dwarfs with masses ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 solar masses. To account for the effects of general relativity on the dynamics of the white dwarf, we utilize a polytropic equation of state, P = Kρ^Γ, where ρ represents mass density and P represents pressure.

Our findings reveal that microtubules exhibit remarkable stiffness when it comes to bending, yet they are relatively soft when stretched. The elastic behavior can be described by an entropic spring model with a persistence length of approximately 1.5 micrometers. Microtubules can be shaped into configurations such as rings or helices without losing their integrity. When we examine their straightness, we observe that it is influenced by the forces applied. This suggests that microtubules possess internal structures that develop during their assembly. These insights enhance our understanding of how microtubules function within cells, where they encounter both external forces and internal tensions from motor proteins acting upon them. Microtubules (MTs) are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, intracellular transport, and mechanosensing. They are composed of tubulin dimers arranged in a head-to-tail fashion to form protofilaments. MTs originate from centrosomes and exhibit dynamic instability, alternating stochastically between phases of growth and shrinkage. Additionally, microtubules interact strongly with motor proteins; for instance, kinesin-1 moves processively along the MT, while dyneins exert pulling forces. These motors generate forces that can cause MTs to buckle and deform. It has been proposed that such deformations may lead to mechanical instabilities and even catastrophic failures. However, there has been limited research on the mechanics of individual MTs under these conditions. In this study, we employ optical tweezers to explore the elastic properties of Jarvis MTs.

        "original_text": "We study the circular and non-circular motion near the event horizons of rotating black holes by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, which is an extension of the standard geodesic approach to include higher-order corrections due to gravitational radiation reaction effects. We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family has smaller orbital frequency than the outer one; it corresponds to bound orbits while the outer solution describes unbound orbits. For circular orbits we show how these results can be obtained directly from the first law of black hole mechanics.

Our findings reveal that both circular and non-circular orbits exhibit two distinct families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family has smaller orbital radii compared to the outer one; the inner solution corresponds to bound orbits, while the outer solution describes unbound trajectories. For circular orbits, we demonstrate how these solutions can be derived from the laws of black hole mechanics. Additionally, we provide numerical evidence that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) shifts inward as the spin parameter increases.

Since then, numerous observations have supported this model. To understand the dynamics of matter falling into black holes, it is crucial to determine where matter is trapped or scattered. This understanding hinges on identifying the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which represents the closest possible radius for stable orbits around a black hole. The position of the ISCO is highly sensitive to the spin parameter \\( J = Ma^2/(2r_g) \\) of the black hole: if \\( J < M^2 \\), then the ISCO is greater than \\( 3M \\); however, as \\( J \\) approaches \\( M^2 \\), the ISCO decreases rapidly until it reaches the Schwarzschild radius \\( R_s \\equiv 2GM/c^2 \\). Therefore, understanding the behavior of the ISCO is essential for elucidating the physics of matter in close proximity to black holes.",

We explore how this scenario could elucidate several perplexing phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. Specifically, we argue that: (i) the observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be accounted for by the existence of a halo of ultracompact dark matter surrounding each galaxy; (ii) the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters, occurs through the gravitational collapse of overdensities in the primordial density field, influenced by quantum fluctuations during inflation; and (iii) dark matter may consist of ultracompact objects with masses around \\(10^{22}\\) GeV. This article is part of a series on Quantum Matter. For further details, please visit http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604070. \n\nIntroduction: Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new types of elementary particles, which have yet to be confirmed experimentally. One particularly intriguing class of models involves so-called WIMPZILLAs—stable relic particles with masses around \\(10^9\\) GeV or higher. These particles are expected to have been thermally produced in the early universe, but their current abundance could still be detected through their annihilation signals. In this letter, we propose an alternative explanation for the nature of dark matter, suggesting that it consists of self-gravitating bosons. Boson stars are gravitationally bound states of scalar fields, which have been studied in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories, where they serve as solitonic solutions. More recently, boson stars have been investigated in various theoretical frameworks. If these objects exist, they could form a population of compact structures that account for all or a portion of the dark matter in the universe.",

These findings are significant for understanding the underlying mechanisms behind the experimental observations of rippling effects on the electronic properties of graphene devices. Graphene exhibits remarkable electronic properties due to its unique two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, which gives rise to various novel phenomena such as high carrier mobility, Klein tunneling, and valley polarization. However, experimental studies have demonstrated that pristine flat monolayer graphene tends to develop ripples spontaneously. It has been suggested that these ripples could influence the performance of graphene-based devices. In this study, we investigate the impact of ripples on the electronic and transport properties using a tight-binding approach. We find that the strain induced by the ripples can create an energy gap around the Fermi level for both armchair and zigzag orientations.

Introduction\nSemi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (SIDIS) has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This process provides insights into the quark structure of the target nucleus through the interactions of produced hadrons with the scattered lepton. At high Bjorken x, where the active quarks are highly virtual, SIDIS probes the significant region between the non-perturbative regime described by effective field theories and the perturbative regime governed by perturbative quantum chromodynamics. In this kinematic regime, it becomes crucial to examine the properties of bound-state hadrons through their interactions with virtual photons, thereby offering insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of composite states. Theoretical studies have indicated that the hadron production in SIDIS is strongly dependent on the transverse momentum (k_T) of the produced hadrons. It has been shown that the dependence of cross-sections on k_T can help differentiate between various theoretical approaches. For instance, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism predict a significant increase in cross-sections with increasing k_T, while those based on the CCFM evolution equations lead to different predictions. \n\n2.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is one of the most fundamental models for studying non-equilibrium phenomena. It describes particles hopping along a one-dimensional lattice of L sites under specific rules: each site i (where i = 1, ..., L) can hold at most one particle; if a site is unoccupied, a particle can hop to the right with a certain rate; if a particle is present, it remains stationary. If another particle attempts to move into an occupied site, it cannot proceed until the site becomes available. This model has garnered significant attention due to the interesting properties of its stationary state, which depend on the boundary conditions. Previous studies have explored various boundary conditions, including open boundaries where particles enter from the leftmost site at a rate α and exit from the rightmost site at a rate β. For instance, when α = β = 1/2, the stationary state becomes independent of the initial conditions. Conversely, when α > β, the stationary state exhibits phase separation, while for α < β, it displays non-uniform profiles. These characteristics make the ASEP a powerful framework for analyzing non-equilibrium systems.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nIn our research, we found that standard Wilson-type fermions face significant challenges, such as the species doubling problem, as outlined by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, and the Gribov ambiguity. These issues have been addressed by introducing various types of fermionic formulations. Among these, the overlap-Dirac operator is perhaps the most notable, as its eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. However, the computational cost of this operator increases rapidly with larger lattice volumes due to the need for exact calculations of the inverse Dirac operator. To mitigate these costs, several approximate methods have been proposed. Among these, the Neuberger overlap operator appears to be the most favorable option to date. Another promising approach involves the concept of exact renormalization. It has been shown that the fermion determinant detD(μ), where D(μ) represents the fermion matrix defined through the fermionic action, satisfies a specific flow equation.",

Another key feature is entanglement, which refers to correlations between particles that cannot be explained by classical physics. In this work, we address the following question: given a system consisting of N spin-1/2 particles, what is the overall state? Specifically, if all particles were to exist simultaneously, what would be the resulting state of the system?

These materials exhibit unique properties due to their reduced dimensions, typically on the order of tens of nanometers. For instance, they can demonstrate ballistic and coherent transport regimes. Experimental studies have shown that the magnitude of conductance fluctuations in these systems is highly dependent on temperature (T) and system size (L), decreasing rapidly with increasing T and decreasing L. At low temperatures, the primary source of conductance fluctuations arises from interference effects. However, at higher temperatures, thermal averaging disrupts coherence among different pathways.

However, numerous questions remain regarding the properties of this recently discovered state, including whether it is part of a larger multiplet. In the context of supersymmetry, each SM particle has a superpartner that differs only in spin. If R-parity is conserved, all superpartners must be produced in pairs. One implication of this scenario is the potential existence of multiple Higgs doublets. Specifically, if the scalar Higgs boson observed at the LHC corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate (h₀) of such a multiplet, then the next-to-lightest CP-eigenstates (H₀ and A₀) could couple strongly to fermions.

Additionally, we have found evidence of atomic hydrogen extending beyond our observed limits, which may be linked to tidal features or interactions with neighboring galaxies. These results align with previous studies suggesting that many spiral galaxies exhibit large reservoirs of interstellar hydrogen distributed over several kiloparsecs. \n\nKeywords: Atomic Hydrogen, Galaxy Evolution, Spiral Structure.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nDark Matter (DM) remains one of the most significant mysteries in modern physics. Its presence has only been inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on galaxies, clusters, and other cosmic structures, while direct detection experiments have thus far been unsuccessful. Numerous models of CDM (Cold Dark Matter) have been proposed; however, most of them have not been experimentally validated. One possibility is that DM consists of elementary particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter. If they interact electromagnetically, they might escape detection even if they are abundant. Conversely, if they interact strongly enough with normal matter, they could be detectable. Various experiments aimed at searching for DM have been conducted. Recently, the DAMA collaboration reported significant findings regarding annual modulation, suggesting that the motion of the Earth around the Sun leads to an increase in the rate of nuclear recoils detected from June to October compared to December to February. Such behavior cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics. Several researchers have proposed different theories to account for these observations.",

One of the most interesting phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantized Hall effect (FQHE)  4  .

One of the most intriguing phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It has been shown that when the number of electrons \\(N\\) is odd, the lowest Landau level (LLL) accommodates only one electron per magnetic flux quantum. FQHEs have garnered significant interest because they offer a unique opportunity to explore many-body effects in condensed matter physics. Recently, several researchers have investigated the properties of the modified Coulomb interaction between two oppositely charged particles moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to their motion. They found that the ground state energy critically depends on whether the total angular momentum \\(J = L + S\\) is zero, where \\(L\\) is the orbital angular momentum and \\(S\\) is the spin. Specifically, if \\(J = 0\\), the ground state energy is given by \\(E_0 = -e^2 / l_B + O(1/N)\\), where \\(l_B = eB/mc\\) is the magnetic length. Conversely, if \\(J = 1/2\\), the ground state energy takes a different form.",

Introduction\nGraphene has garnered considerable attention recently due to its unique properties. It consists of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, where each carbon atom forms covalent bonds with three neighboring carbon atoms. Owing to its two-dimensional nature, graphene exhibits high carrier mobility, exceptional conductivity, remarkable mechanical strength, optical transparency, and flexibility.

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are strips of graphene with finite widths, have been proposed as fundamental components for various applications, including transistors, interconnects, photodetectors, and solar cells. Compared to traditional silicon-based electronics, GNRs offer numerous advantages: they exhibit high electron mobilities, allow for better control over charge transport, provide greater design flexibility, and enable multifunctionality. However, challenges remain in the practical realization of GNRs, such as the need for precise control over fabrication parameters and edge roughness. Additionally, the electrical properties of GNRs are highly sensitive to these factors.",

In this study, we introduce an interactive visual analytics tool that enables users to explore extensive volumes of 3D oceanographic data, facilitating the detection of patterns and anomalies. Our primary objective is to equip scientists with robust tools for data analysis without requiring them to have expertise in computer science or visualization techniques. We utilize state-of-the-art volume rendering methods, incorporating advanced features such as brushing, linking, and querying. Our research is grounded in real-world oceanographic datasets collected during various research cruises across Europe. This article outlines our findings and future directions. Oceanographers are increasingly faced with vast amounts of data regarding oceanic properties (e.g., temperature, salinity) and biological phenomena (e.g., plankton blooms). These datasets can be instrumental in studying global shipping patterns, disease spread, and migratory behaviors. However, the analysis and interpretation of these large datasets remain challenging due to their high dimensionality and complex relationships among variables. Interactive visual analytics have demonstrated significant potential in helping scientists uncover hidden patterns and anomalies within their data.

However, we recover these functions by expressing the NDCF as an integral over the relevant variables. We demonstrate how these challenges can be addressed by introducing a new quantity, the modified density correlation function (LNDCF). The LNDCF is free from infrared divergences while still capturing correlations between different spatial scales. Specifically, we analyze the LNDCF in two limiting scenarios: when all particles have equal velocities and when their velocity distribution follows a Maxwellian profile.

We find that there are three distinct types of black holes depending on whether the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is positive or negative. This framework allows for two classes of static, spherically symmetric black holes that lack event horizons but feature naked singularities at their centers. Additionally, we identify another solution: an asymptotically anti-de Sitter wormhole with a throat connecting two asymptotic regions. Finally, utilizing a recently developed method by one of the authors, we construct a novel solution representing a time-dependent spacetime horn.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe resurgence of gravitational waves has provided a new perspective on our understanding of gravitation, particularly in the context of general relativity. However, despite its successes, general relativity still struggles to explain certain phenomena such as dark matter and black hole singularities. As a result, numerous alternative theories of gravity have been proposed over the years. One such alternative is the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity, which can be viewed as a natural extension of general relativity, incorporating higher-order curvature corrections. Moreover, this theory has led to intriguing discoveries regarding black holes, wormholes, and even time-dependent spacetimes. Recently, EGB gravity has gained attention due to its significant role in explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nMolecular motors are crucial for various biological processes, including muscle contraction, vesicle transport, chromosome segregation, and cellular movement. They convert chemical energy into mechanical work through repeated interactions with cytoskeletal filaments, such as microtubules, and their subsequent release. Kinesins represent the most extensively studied class of molecular motors, moving along microtubules toward their plus ends, while myosins transport along actin filaments toward their minus ends. Both types of motors have been shown to exhibit stochastic stepping behavior even in the absence of external loads. Recent studies have revealed that kinesins and myosins display this randomness, which may be attributed to thermal fluctuations or internal dynamics. However, questions remain regarding how these motors respond to external loads.

Helium has been the subject of extensive research, both experimentally and theoretically, revealing two stable isotopes (3He and 4He) along with several excited states. These states have been examined using various spectroscopic techniques, including absorption spectroscopy, laser excitation, and Compton scattering. Despite the significant progress made, a satisfactory explanation remains elusive regarding why the 3He state is unbound while the 4He state is bound. To further understand the structure of helium, we propose a theoretical framework in which the electron is characterized not only by its position but also by its momentum vector.

Here we show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) can be delivered directly to synaptic sites by lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane or indirectly via endocytosis followed by recycling endosomes. We used single-particle tracking with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to follow GluR2-containing AMPA receptors tagged with quantum dots at hippocampal neuron dendrites. The results reveal two distinct trafficking routes for receptor delivery to synapses. First, receptors diffuse laterally along the surface until encountering an existing synapse where they become trapped.

The results are compared to those obtained when fitting directly for these six orbital elements as well as the moon-to-host radius ratio and moon phase function simultaneously. Our analysis shows that our new method can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the moon s physical characteristics even if its orbit has significant eccentricities or inclinations. \n \n Keywords: Exoplanet, Moon, Transit Timing Variations, Photometry \n \n Transiting planets have been found around more than 1000 stars so far1.

These moons play crucial roles in planetary evolution but are challenging to detect through direct imaging due to their small sizes. Consequently, we seek alternative methods to ascertain their physical properties. In particular, the study of moons around extrasolar giant planets provides valuable insights into their formation processes. Here, we propose a novel approach to estimate the characteristics of exomoons based solely on their transit light curves. This method does not require prior knowledge of the planet's orbital parameters, allowing us to detect moons with highly inclined or eccentric orbits. Furthermore, it is effective regardless of whether the planet is tidally locked or free-rotating. Ultimately, it yields reliable estimates of the moon's size, mass, and density.

We have developed an analytical model for calculating the spectrum emitted by a thin, optically thick accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole and applied it to several BHCs with known mass functions. The observed spectra are well reproduced when we assume that the inner edge of the disk is located at 6 gravitational radii. This result suggests that the standard thin disk model can be used as a good approximation for modeling the X-ray continuum emission of these objects. \n \n Keywords: Black holes -- Spectroscopy -- X-rays -- Modeling -- Accretion disks -- Emission lines -- Broad-band spectral energy distribution -- Luminosity function -- Mass measurement -- Stellar-mass black holes -- Supermassive black holes -- Active galactic nuclei -- Quasars -- Cosmic evolution \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In recent years there has been considerable progress made towards understanding the physical processes occurring near supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasars, and other similar systems. These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly.

These studies primarily rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over various time scales. However, due to their complex nature, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are challenging. Instead, researchers often use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between different properties of AGNs to estimate their luminosities. For instance, if one can determine how light from an AGN passes through a specific region of interest, it is possible to estimate its luminosity using geometric considerations. Alternatively, knowing the distance to an AGN allows for the calculation of its absolute magnitude. Unfortunately, both methods require detailed knowledge of the emitting regions, which is not always available through direct observation. Therefore, to accurately estimate the luminosities of AGNs, it is essential to develop models that can reproduce the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

We show that these theories are not free at high energies but instead have an interacting fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. This is achieved by using the recently developed technique of holographic renormalization to compute the beta functions of the gauge coupling constants as well as those associated with higher-derivative terms in the action. The latter can be used to stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. In particular we find that there exists a large class of models which admit metastable de Sitter solutions. These results provide further evidence for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS 7 vacuua in this context. Introduction: Recently it has been shown  1  that certain classes of N = 1 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions may be realized via compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds X 3 . It was also found  2  that such constructions generically lead to massive gravitons in five dimensions whose masses scale like M 2 grav ∝ V −3 , where V denotes the volume of X 3 . As a result one expects that the effective gravitational constant G 5 will run logarithmically with energy  3  .\nIn  4  it was suggested that this running could be stopped if one considers non-perturbative effects due to Euclidean D3-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles L ∈ H 4 (X 3 ; Z). Indeed, it turns out that the corresponding instanton contributions generate a term proportional to R ∧ R in the lowenergy effective action  5  . If this term dominates over other contributions then the resulting vacuum solution should correspond to anti-de Sitter space  6  . Moreover, since the instanton contribution scales like e −1/g s , where g s denotes the string coupling constant, one finds that the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space decreases exponentially fast when approaching weak coupling  7, 8  .

Our findings indicate that these theories are not asymptotically free at high energies; rather, they possess an ultraviolet fixed point characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom. This analysis employs the recently developed method of holographic renormalization to compute the beta functions of the gauge coupling constants, as well as those related to higher-order terms in the effective action. The results can be utilized to stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. Notably, we demonstrate the existence of a broad class of models that exhibit metastable de Sitter vacua. These findings provide additional support for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS7 vacua within this framework.\n\nIntroduction: It has been established that certain classes of N = 1 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions can be realized through compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds, denoted as X3. Furthermore, it was discovered that such constructions typically lead to the emergence of massive gravitons in five dimensions, with their masses scaling as M^2_grav ∼ V^(-3), where V represents the volume of X3. Consequently, one anticipates that the five-dimensional gravitational constant G5 will exhibit logarithmic running behavior. It was proposed that this running could be mitigated by considering non-perturbative effects arising from Euclidean D3-branes, which contribute to the Lagrangian as L ∈ H^4(X3; Z). Indeed, it turns out that these instanton contributions generate a term proportional to R ∧ R in the low-energy effective action. If this term dominates over other contributions, the resulting vacuum solution is expected to correspond to anti-de Sitter space. Moreover, since the instanton contributions scale as g_s^(-1), where g_s is the string coupling constant, one finds that the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space decreases exponentially as one approaches weak coupling. Thus, to achieve a phenomenologically viable scenario...",

Introduction\nImage registration is one of the most fundamental tasks in various fields, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and computer vision. It involves finding a spatial transformation that maps each point \\( x \\in \\Omega_1 = [0, 1]^d \\) to its corresponding location \\( y = T(x) \\in \\Omega_2 = [0, 1]^d \\) in another image \\( I(y) \\). Here, \\( d \\) represents the dimensionality of the space. For instance, if \\( T_1 \\) and \\( T_2 \\) are two consecutive transformations in a dynamic sequence, identifying the optimal transformation \\( T \\) allows us to track the movement of objects over time. Similarly, if \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) represent two views of the same scene captured by cameras with slightly different orientations, registering these images enables us to merge information from multiple viewpoints. Recent years have seen significant interest in developing fast and accurate registration algorithms. However, despite considerable progress in addressing this challenging problem, it remains unsolved due to various factors, including a high number of degrees of freedom, the presence of noise, partial occlusions, and lack of feature correspondence.",

The resulting embryo then evolves into either a gas giant planet or a pair of planets with similar masses, depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This process differs significantly from scenarios where all bodies interact simultaneously; notably, we observe that multiple stable outcomes can arise even when the initial conditions are identical.

        "rewrite_text": "We are investigating optical and near-infrared (NIR) data for GRB 060206, which indicates that its X-ray to optical afterglow is characterized by an achromatic break at t_break = 1.3 days, followed by a power-law decay with an index of -1.2 (Fν ∝ t^-1.2). The absence of any spectral change across this break suggests that it was not caused by interactions with the surrounding medium. We found no evidence for significant extinction along our line of sight; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of reddening due to dust in the host galaxy. Our findings align with previous assertions that the achromatic breaks observed in many other gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be attributed to late-time energy injections rather than being the result of a jet break. \n\n**Keywords:** Gamma-ray bursts, Afterglow emission, Energy injection, Jet break, Redshift measurement \n\n**INTRODUCTION** \n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in understanding how gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce their broad-spectrum electromagnetic emissions. This research has led to several successful models for the prompt emission of GRBs (see, e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but there remains a focus on the characteristics of the afterglow emissions. A notable feature of most afterglows is the presence of a steepening or break in the light curve around one day post-burst (Rhoads 1999). Such breaks have often been interpreted as the point at which the relativistic ejecta becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, allowing the emission to decline rapidly. However, some researchers argue that these breaks may occur if the ejecta continues to interact with the surrounding medium following the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000), while others propose that they could result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008). Another explanation for these breaks involves interstellar scintillation (Goodman 1997; Goodman & Narayan 2006).",

The deviation is more pronounced when we use the SZ signal to estimate cluster masses instead of using the X-ray temperatures. This may be due to non-thermal pressure support or biases introduced by different selection effects between X-ray and SZ surveys.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe presence of smaller particles can significantly influence the properties of larger particles through depletion forces. These effects are crucial in various phenomena, including protein crystallization, gelation, and sedimentation. Depending on the relative sizes of the components, the mixture may be either miscible or immiscible. Additionally, there are regions of metastability and even multiple phase coexistence. Several studies have explored the effects of depletion attractions on the phase behavior of simple mixtures. However, most of these studies rely on idealized models that overlook hydrodynamic interactions, finite-size effects, polydispersity, and other complexities. Recently, some researchers have begun to incorporate more realistic features such as Brownian motion, electrostatic repulsion, and van der Waals attraction. Despite these advancements, accurately predicting the location of the critical point remains challenging due to strong correlations among the components.

We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector. In turn, the orientations of galactic angular momenta determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction processes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the shape distribution of galaxies could provide information about the origin of galactic angular momentums (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008) . However, observational studies show conflicting results regarding whether there exists any preferred direction of galaxy spin axes relative to their neighbors  positions (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 , for recent works).\nIn order to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for determining the directions of galactic angular momentas, we need to study the statistical properties of galaxy spin distributions over large volumes of the universe.

        "rewrite_text": "We provide an analysis of the alignments between galaxy spins and tidal fields in real space, utilizing data from the Two Mass Redshift Survey (TMRS). Our findings indicate that galaxies tend to align preferentially perpendicular to their tidal fields on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is more pronounced for galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed correlation between spin and tidal fields can be attributed to the torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play a significant role in the angular momentum of galaxies. These insights have important implications for understanding how dark matter halos influence their surrounding environment, as well as for interpreting cosmic shear statistics.\n\nIntroduction: Galaxies are situated within overdense regions of the universe, where they interact strongly with other structures, such as neighboring galaxies or clusters. During their formation, these interactions can exert dynamic torques that affect the orientation of the galaxies' angular momentum vectors. Consequently, the orientations of these angular momentum vectors influence the shapes of the galaxies through dynamical friction. It has been proposed that the observed distributions of galaxies could provide insights into the dynamics of their angular momentum (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008). However, observational studies have produced conflicting results regarding whether there is a correlation between the orientations of galaxy spins and their positions (see, for example, Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 for recent research). To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed distributions of galaxy spins, we focus on the statistical properties of spin orientations over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), provide the necessary data to analyze these orientations with sufficient accuracy. For instance, Lee et al. (2008) utilized SDSS DR4 data to examine the alignments between galaxy spins and their nearest neighbors, but they found no significant correlation.",

One of the key characteristics of superfluids is their ability to flow without dissipation, which has led to various applications, including superconductors. Recently, ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have emerged as a new platform for exploring quantum phenomena. These systems exhibit fascinating behaviors such as Mott insulating phases, supersolids, and even topological states. Furthermore, they allow for the tuning of interaction parameters and the observation of collective excitations. This makes them ideal candidates for investigating theoretical predictions. In particular, bosonic atoms in optical lattices can form a Bose-Einstein condensate, which behaves similarly to a superfluid. Recent experiments have observed superflow and vortices in these systems. However, unlike traditional superfluids, the condensates in optical lattices interact strongly with one another. Therefore, understanding how interatomic interactions affect collective excitations is crucial.

Our main conclusions are: 1) Galaxy clusters exhibit significant deviations from isotropic dynamical equilibrium; 2) These deviations can be accounted for by assuming that the dark matter distribution has a radially biased velocity dispersion tensor; 3) This assumption suggests that the dark matter halos surrounding individual galaxies have elongated shapes with varying orientations relative to one another. Additionally, our analysis provides important constraints on the mass-to-light ratio for the studied clusters. Using HST observations of four nearby galaxy clusters, we find evidence that the dark matter distribution exhibits a strong radial dependence in its velocity dispersion tensor.",

An intriguing class of such solutions was discovered by Bañados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ), who demonstrated how to obtain a static black hole solution in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. A key feature of these solutions is their asymptotic behavior; they describe black holes with event horizons that are completely characterized by global parameters such as mass or charge. However, despite their utility for studying gravitational phenomena, these solutions do not provide detailed insights into the properties of spacetime near the singularities. It would be beneficial to extend them into more complex geometries that incorporate additional parameters defining the internal structure of the black hole. One approach to achieve this is to consider higher-dimensional generalizations of the BTZ solution. Alternatively, one could explore duality transformations on known solutions. For instance, starting with the Schwarzschild solution in spherical coordinates and applying an appropriate transformation could yield another solution expressed in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates.",

The RFM is designed as an ultrathin device that is accelerated to high speeds by femtosecond laser pulses directed at it at a specific angle. We observe that the interaction between the counter-propagating laser beams leads to a shift in frequencies, which are significantly altered compared to those produced without the RFM. This phenomenon can be explained through the principles of nonlinear optics and advanced electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential for generating high-energy photons through laser collisions in a vacuum. These discoveries have significant implications for applications such as imaging or X-ray sources based on tabletop experiments. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the interactions of lasers with matter under extreme conditions. One particular area of research focuses on the novel phenomena associated with the interaction of lasers in vacuum, where the effects of strong quantum electrodynamics (QED) have been observed. For instance, the experimental emission of electrons and positrons has been documented when intense laser pulses are directed onto thin foils. Additionally, the generation of photons and particle pairs in vacuum has been theoretically explored. In this letter, we report our experimental observation of another intriguing phenomenon related to the interaction of lasers in vacuum—the relativistic tennis effect. This occurs when two counter-propagating laser beams collide within a vacuum chamber. When these beams interact, they produce new frequencies that are shifted to higher energies. This effect arises from the coherent addition of the electric fields from both lasers, resulting in the formation of a standing wave pattern. Consequently, the amplitude of the standing wave increases, leading to the emergence of new frequencies. Here, we document the first observation of the relativistic tennis effect. To achieve this, we employed a relativistically flying mirror.",

They have been extensively studied both theoretically and observationally over many years. A significant aspect of their physics involves how various entities behave in close proximity to them, particularly those that can be influenced by the black hole's gravity. Recent studies have revealed interesting dynamics occurring very close to the event horizon. For instance, when considering a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, its trajectory will be affected by the photon sphere. If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, it will eventually fall into the black hole after emitting photons. Another fascinating phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole, where the dynamics are similarly influenced by the presence of the photon sphere. However, unlike in the case of a Reissner-Nordström black hole, the interactions here involve not only photons but also gravitons. In this context, the study of scalar fields outside black holes has been a focus of research, particularly in determining the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs), which are the characteristic frequencies associated with these systems.",

We demonstrate analytically that if the maximum beta is below a certain threshold, all modes remain stable regardless of their frequencies or wavelengths. This finding is consistent with our numerical simulations. Finally, we investigate the impact of curvature on the stability properties of longitudinal flows. It turns out that while curvature does not influence the stability characteristics of these flows, it does affect the nature of the eigenfunctions associated with different eigenvalues.",

They have been extensively studied through computer simulations; however, obtaining reliable data has been challenging due to finite size effects. These effects arise because interfaces are typically only one molecular layer thick, making them difficult to simulate accurately. Instead, boundary conditions are often employed to connect images of the same system. Consequently, the interfacial properties are highly dependent on system size. Recent research has made significant strides in understanding these finite-size effects, demonstrating that the behavior of interfacial properties follows a power law related to the system size.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) successfully describes most experimental data available today, but its validity has been confirmed only up to energies of approximately 1 TeV. At higher energies, phenomena emerge that are not accounted for by the SM. To address these effects, one typically considers extensions of the SM or models based on effective field theories. Effective theories offer a systematic approach to incorporate corrections from physics at energy scales beyond the reach of the SM. They enable us to calculate observables using perturbative methods, even when the underlying physics cannot be described within the framework of standard quantum mechanics. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where there is no fundamental understanding of the physical processes involved. One prominent example is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interaction. QCD predicts the existence of hadrons composed of quarks and gluons. However, since the typical distances within a hadron are significantly smaller than the scale of QCD interactions, these components can be analyzed separately from the overall dynamics. For instance, the production of light and heavy flavors in high-energy collisions can be computed using perturbative techniques. Conversely, the interactions among partons must also be considered.",

We show that this new formalism allows us to obtain exact results for several interesting cases where standard methods fail or are not applicable. In particular we consider two different types of boundary conditions at one end of the chain (the origin) which lead to completely different behaviour of the system as time evolves.

To tackle these complexities, the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism has been proposed. In this framework, one considers a system evolving deterministically over time, interspersed with random transitions between states. These transitions occur as a result of interactions with other fluctuating degrees of freedom, such as phonons, electrons, and photons.

Introduction\n\nAn intriguing aspect of string theories is their capacity to incorporate gravity into the fundamental framework of nature. This has sparked renewed interest in studying thick branes that exhibit supersymmetry. One such class of spacetimes is characterized by warped geometries, where the metric takes the form ds² = e²A(y)(ημνdxμdxν + dy²), where y represents the coordinate along the brane, A(y) is the warp factor, and ημν is the Minkowski metric. In the case of five-dimensional scenarios, this corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum model. Recent studies have shown that the presence of a nontrivial warp factor leads to significant features in the physics of fields propagating in the bulk. These include modifications to standard dispersion relations, spontaneous symmetry breaking, fermion localization, and more. It has been established that the effects of the warp factor are critically dependent on its behavior near the boundary of the thick brane. If the warp factor decreases sufficiently rapidly at infinity, all observables will align with those computed using a conventional flat brane. However, if the warp factor does not diminish quickly enough, novel phenomena emerge.",

This suggests that the gravitational torques exerted by the bar can trigger the conversion of molecular gas into new generations of stars. \n- The emission associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shows a clear correlation with regions of active star formation. \n- Our data, when compared with hydrodynamical simulations, indicates that the observed distribution of the interstellar medium can be explained if the bar's gravitational potential has effectively driven gas towards its Lindblad resonances.",

The SSAs are analyzed as functions of transverse momentum, rapidity, the azimuthal angle between jets, and event centrality. We find no significant dependence on any kinematic variable, except that the magnitude of the asymmetry decreases with increasing rapidity. Our results are compared to predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations, including corrections for various uncertainties in parton distribution functions. The measurements are consistent within the uncertainties reported. This represents the most precise measurement of this observable to date.\n\nIntroduction: Single transverse spin asymmetries have been observed in various processes involving polarized protons or neutrons, such as inclusive pion production, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan lepton pair production, prompt photon production, and direct photon emission. These measurements provide crucial insights into the spin structure of nucleons. Specifically, they can be used to test the validity of factorization theorems that connect hard scattering cross sections to partonic distributions within the proton. Additionally, these observables can offer insights into physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent studies suggest that large transverse spin asymmetries may arise from the interference of two amplitudes corresponding to different helicities of quarks originating from longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy p + p collisions. Such effects challenge parity conservation and could indicate new physics. However, there has only been one previous measurement of transverse spin asymmetries in hadronic dijet production at high energies, conducted at RHIC, where the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision was √sNN = 200 GeV, which is significantly lower than our current study.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nUnderstanding how macroscopic systems behave under the influence of their environment has been a fundamental question in physics since its inception. This challenge becomes even more complex when addressing many-body systems, such as those found in condensed matter or quantum field theories, where the number of degrees of freedom can be substantial. A powerful approach to tackle these issues involves studying the dynamics of the system conditioned on specific measurements performed on the relevant degrees of freedom. In recent years, various methods have been developed to efficiently describe the time evolution of quantum states. Among these, the Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) presents a promising alternative due to its capability to capture non-Markovian effects. However, despite its strengths in providing insights into short-time dynamics, the HDM struggles to accurately reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the system. To address this limitation, we propose a new formulation of the HDM, termed the Hierarchy of Density Tensors.",

Introduction\n\nStellar ages are essential in various fields of astrophysics, ranging from Galactic archaeology to exoplanet science. Specifically, accurate ages are crucial for understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars is challenging due to their wide range of masses, luminosities, and complex evolutionary histories. For instance, while main-sequence turn-off ages can be accurately estimated using photometric methods such as isochrones and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these methods become less reliable beyond the red giant branch, where convection significantly affects the results. Although asteroseismic techniques allow us to investigate the interiors of evolved stars, the complexity of the resulting data necessitates detailed modeling of each star individually. Consequently, alternative methods must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars with varying characteristics. Gyrochronology offers a promising approach for estimating ages based on the spin-down rates of magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003). It has been demonstrated that the Rossby number (Ro), defined as the ratio between the rotation period (Prot) and the convective overturning timescale, plays a key role in this method.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate how the behavior of the Carter constant is influenced by the spin and mass ratio in binary systems containing spinning black holes, utilizing simulations based on general relativity. Our findings indicate that the Carter constant is weak when the black holes are aligned or anti-aligned, but becomes strong when there is a non-zero angle between their spins. This suggests that it may be possible to measure the quadrupole moment of the black holes by observing their gravitational waves during the late stages of inspiral. Such observations could provide insights into the spacetime geometry near the event horizon, which remains to be explored.\n\nIntroduction: In this study, we examine how the behavior of the Carter constant is affected by the spin and mass ratio in binary systems of two spinning black holes. The Carter constant is one of several constants associated with geodesic motion around Kerr black holes (Carter, 1968). It serves as an indicator of the spacetime geometry near the event horizon, as its value changes over time only if there are significant deviations from axial symmetry at small radii (Bardeen, 1973; Thorne et al., 1986). In binary systems, the presence of an accretion disk can lead to variations in the Carter constant, even though the total angular momentum of the system remains constant (Kerr, 1963). Previous studies have shown that the orbital dynamics of binaries with non-spinning components are influenced by the black holes' quadrupole moment, expressed as Q = M(1 - S²)/c²R², where S is the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar, 1999). However, these effects become negligible when the black holes are in a rapid plunge phase due to strong gravitational interactions caused by the emission of gravitational waves. Furthermore, observations indicate that many galactic centers host supermassive black holes with masses reaching up to 10^9 solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al., 2000). These systems are believed to evolve through multiple phases of mass accretion before reaching their final state of coalescence. During such interactions, the black holes could experience significant tidal forces and other dynamical effects.",

Our results indicate that these correlation functions can be effectively described by an exponential function with a correlation length that increases as the temperature approaches the glass transition point. This increase aligns with predictions from Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT), although we observe deviations from MCT near the glass transition temperature (Tg). These deviations are attributed to dynamic heterogeneities that arise close to Tg. The data we provide offer valuable insights into the nature of spatio-temporal fluctuations in glassy materials. Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow relaxation processes over a wide range of timescales. Specifically, they demonstrate non-exponential relaxations, aging phenomena, and other characteristics associated with glassy behavior. Theories such as MCT have been developed to explain these phenomena. However, despite their successes, there remain significant questions about how well MCT describes real systems. A key issue is the influence of spatial correlations between local regions where particles move more or less rapidly. These correlations arise due to cooperative rearrangements and/or dynamical heterogeneity. Recent theoretical work has shown that spatial correlations play a crucial role in shaping the form of the dynamic structure factor, Fs(q, t), where q represents the wavevector corresponding to the probed length scale, and t denotes the lag time used to evaluate Fs(q, t). To determine whether MCT captures all relevant physics, it is essential to experimentally investigate the spatial correlations.

The CME speed is estimated to be about 1450 km/s at 1 AU using STEREO observations. We find that this CME originated from a complex magnetic structure consisting of two opposite-polarity flux systems connected by a filament channel. In addition, we found that there were several small-scale brightenings around the main sunspots before the onset of the flare/CME activity.

However, we observed variations in the bias parameter across different redshift bins, which aligns with our expectations. Furthermore, we investigated how this clustering evolves as a function of stellar mass and UV luminosity. Our analysis reveals that there are no significant differences in the clustering dynamics when considering only those galaxies above or below a specific threshold in either stellar mass or UV luminosity.",

Introduction\nConvolutional neural networks have been widely utilized in various computer vision applications. Recently, they have been adapted for different types of optimization tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and more. However, most existing research primarily focuses on optimizing a single objective function. In many real-world scenarios, multiple objective functions must be considered simultaneously.

Thus, there is a pressing need for new methodologies to effectively handle multi-objective optimization challenges. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been employed to address these multi-objective optimization problems, learning policies directly from raw data without the need for handcrafted features.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS The study of Majorana fermions has sparked renewed interest in the exploration of non-abelian anyons in condensed matter physics. Semiconductor nanowires present a promising platform for realizing such exotic states, where they can manifest as end modes or as excitations bound to vortex cores. To experimentally validate these proposals, it is crucial to understand the effects of disorder, electron-electron interactions, and other sources of decoherence on the stability of the Majorana state. A number of theoretical studies have recently addressed various aspects of these issues. However, many fundamental questions remain regarding the interplay among different factors that contribute to the emergence of Majorana modes in realistic experimental scenarios. One key issue is the role of interactions in shaping the nature of the ground state of the system. It has been demonstrated that repulsive interactions tend to favor the formation of a spin-singlet state over a triplet state. Conversely, attractive interactions can lead to the opposite scenario, promoting the formation of a spin-triplet state instead of a singlet state. These findings have been established through various theoretical approaches.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the phenomenon of slow wave resonance (SWR) in multilayered structures composed of anisotropic layers, each defined by its own permittivity tensor and thickness. Our findings indicate that SWR can only occur when the principal axes of the permittivity tensors are aligned with one another within each layer. In this context, we derive expressions for the dispersion relation between the recovered modes and the Bloch wavenumber \\( k_x \\). These results can serve as guidelines for designing multilayered structures that exhibit pronounced SWR effects at low frequencies. \n\n**Keywords:** Slow wave resonance; Anisotropy; Multilayer structure; Dispersion relation. \n\n**1. Introduction** \n\nPeriodic multilayers, consisting of alternating thin films made from different materials, have garnered significant interest in recent years due to their unique properties. These properties include high reflectance, unusual refraction, and nonlinear optical characteristics, making them promising candidates for various applications such as optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics. Recent studies have demonstrated that multilayers composed of anisotropic layers exhibit intriguing electromagnetic phenomena related to slow wave resonance (SWR). This phenomenon occurs when the group velocity of the Bloch modes approaches zero within the structure. This condition leads to a substantial increase in the effective refractive index \\( n_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\omega}{v_{\\text{ph}}} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency and \\( v_{\\text{ph}} \\) is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave. Consequently, the transmission spectrum of the layers is characterized by narrow stop bands, which are highly desirable for many practical applications. \n\nDespite numerous studies on SWR in multilayers, several fundamental questions remain regarding the conditions under which this phenomenon occurs. For instance, it has been experimentally observed that the presence of misaligned anisotropic layers can completely disrupt the SWR effect, even when other layers are properly aligned. Conversely, numerical simulations suggest that...",

Additionally, we observe that the height achieved during each bounce decreases with an increasing number of bounces. Finally, we demonstrate how these observations can be utilized to estimate the surface characteristics based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have been extensively studied in recent years due to their potential applications in microfluidics. These studies typically focus on millimeter-sized droplets impacting hydrophobic surfaces, but they also encompass smaller droplets bouncing off superhydrophobic coatings. In many instances, it has been noted that the droplets exhibit periodic bouncing. However, there are cases of non-periodic bouncing or even chaotic trajectories. Recent research has shown that the lifetimes (i.e., the intervals between successive impacts) of bouncing droplets are significantly affected by their initial velocities. Specifically, if the initial velocity is too high, the droplet will not bounce and will instead slide down the surface until it reaches the bottom. Conversely, if the initial velocity is below a certain threshold, the droplet will continue to bounce indefinitely.",

Specifically, it was observed that, with other parameters held constant, an increase in Rm leads to a rise in both the saturation level of the Maxwell stress tensor and the growth rate of the total unstable density. Increasing S also raises the saturation value of the stress tensor but does not affect its growth rate. Conversely, a decrease in β results in a lower saturation level of the tensor while having minimal impact on its growth rate. It is important to note that these observations are valid only when the initial equilibrium state meets specific constraints that depend on the relevant dimensionless numbers.",

It is important to note that the electronic behavior is influenced not only by the geometry but also significantly by the compositional projections.

The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle interactions explains how these elements were formed during the brief moments following the Big Bang. In this context, I will provide an overview of our current understanding of the synthesis of light nuclei with mass numbers A = 1 - 3, which is achieved through photonuclear reactions at high temperatures and densities in the early universe. This research is particularly relevant for understanding the abundances of these elements, as well as for data obtained from radioactive beams at GSI Darmstadt.

Introduction. The synthesis of light elements in the early universe remains one of the most challenging questions in modern science. It has been established that photons can induce nuclear fusion processes leading to the creation of light elements such as deuterium (D), helium-3 (3He), helium-4 (4He), lithium-7 (7Li), and beryllium-9 (9Be). However, our understanding of the conditions under which these elements were formed has only recently improved. Specifically, temperatures (T) and densities (ρ) reached up to 10^12 K and 10^15 g/cm³, respectively. These extreme conditions can only be replicated in laboratory experiments using relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, due to the rapid timescales involved, such experiments do not allow us to directly observe the formation of these light elements. Instead, they provide insights into the properties of dense matter, which may be relevant for understanding the dynamics of supernova explosions. Conversely, the abundance patterns observed in primordial stars, such as Population II stars, or in metal-poor stars, provide important constraints on models of the early universe and the composition of primordial matter.",

Furthermore, we found that the magnetization increases linearly as the external magnetic field decreases below 1 T and exhibits hysteresis at very low fields, confirming the presence of ferromagnetic behavior.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in using pulsed signals as sources of coherent charge transport. This concept was initially proposed over twenty years ago, but it has only recently been realized in experimental devices. A particularly intriguing class of periodically-driven systems includes those whose properties are significantly influenced by their internal degrees of freedom. These models have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to exhibit a variety of phenomena, ranging from quantum-dot transistors to heavy fermion behavior. Recently, several studies have theoretically explored the potential of using quantum dots and carbon nanotubes as electron pumps. However, most investigations have focused on weak coupling regimes, while experiments typically operate in strong coupling conditions. Therefore, it is essential to extend existing research beyond the weak-coupling limit. The aim of this work is to examine the effects of electron correlations on the performance of a quantum dot-based electron pump. To achieve this, we consider a QD connected to two leads via tunneling barriers. One lead is driven out of equilibrium by applying a time-dependent gate voltage \\( V_g(t) \\), while the second lead functions as a reservoir. This setup is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.",

The resulting composition is significantly affected for sources located beyond redshifts greater than 0.5 due to absorption effects resulting from pair production interactions between cascade photons and the extragalactic background light associated with galaxies. For models of nearby sources, we establish an upper limit on the photon fraction, fγ, of less than 10% to 20%, depending on the assumed UHECR energy spectrum. This constraint aligns with current observations of the diffuse gamma-ray background, as indicated by Fermi/LAT data. Additionally, our analysis reveals that cascade photons are expected to dominate the total diffuse gamma-ray emission below 1 GeV if they originate from within a distance of approximately 100 Mpc from us.",

Finally, we will demonstrate how these two aspects are interconnected through the framework of a Harish-Chandra bimodule. The key insight is that if G is a connected semisimple complex group defined over Q, then there exists an isomorphism between the category of finite-dimensional representations of G (Q) and the category of Harish-Chandra modules for its corresponding affine Hecke algebra. This research was conducted in collaboration with David Vogan at Harvard University during my postdoctoral fellowship.",

To achieve this, we define the process of rounding the parameters of first-order transitions, effectively transforming their landscape without altering the overall fraction of cooperators within the range of 0 to 1. Through numerical simulations, we show that this rounding process consistently enhances the fraction of cooperators at equilibrium across all scenarios examined. Finally, we present a method for determining the optimal rounding configurations that promote cooperation in these networks.",

Notably, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum \\( J = N/2 \\) (where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms).

This approach works well in the weak-coupling regime, where the interaction between atoms is relatively small.

In this article, we focus on a fascinating class of experiments where the properties of these systems can be probed through their response to changes in parameters.

A crucial aspect of these phenomena is the presence of collective charge and/or spin degrees of freedom, which significantly influence the excitation spectrum. In the case of cuprate-based high-temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that the pseudogap regime arises from competing orders originating from different regions of the Brillouin zone.

However, it has been demonstrated that even if all parties involved share maximal entanglement at some point during their protocol, they may still be unable to perform any useful tasks due to decoherence effects. In this study, we investigate how entanglement can be generated between two atoms trapped in an optical cavity. Each atom interacts locally with its own photon, which is coupled to another external photon via a mirror (see Fig. 1). This model is applicable to various systems, such as semiconductor microcavities or trapped atoms. For instance, in a previous study, it was suggested to create a Bose-Einstein condensate within a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity to produce entangled photons, which could then be used to entangle qubits.",

Our findings are compared with results from other techniques, such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Notably, we illustrate that our method is effective in determining the energy gap between the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum in semiconductors.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe study of luminescence phenomena has garnered significant attention over the years due to its ability to provide insights into the electronic structure and optical properties of solids. Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly valuable as it allows us to investigate the dynamics of electrons excited into the conduction band. Numerous studies have focused on developing specialized models to address various aspects of luminescence phenomena. However, many of these studies have operated under the assumption that the system remains close to equilibrium, which has led to inaccuracies in describing certain important experimental observations. For instance, the characteristics of the TSL curves can vary significantly based on the material type; in insulators, they typically exhibit a single peak, while in semiconductors, they can display multiple features. Additionally, even within the same category of materials, such as semiconductor crystals, the behavior can differ based on doping levels. These variations cannot be adequately explained by existing theories.",

This issue frequently arises in engineering applications involving complex phenomena such as multiphysics coupling, material failure, and contact mechanics. For instance, in nonlinear systems, varying initial conditions can lead to different equilibrium states. Similarly, in certain engineering contexts, multiple steady-state solutions may exist for different boundary conditions. To effectively utilize the reduced basis method (RBM) for these types of problems, it is essential to have a comprehensive set of snapshots that represent all potential solution behaviors. However, since each snapshot corresponds to a specific solution behavior, capturing them accurately through standard finite element analysis can be challenging. Consequently, various strategies have been developed over the past decade to address this challenge.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS \n\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been studied for over 50 years. It describes a ferromagnetic system where each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbors through a coupling constant \\( J_{ij} \\), while also experiencing an external random magnetic field \\( h_i \\) acting on different sites. Numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, both experimentally and theoretically. The interest in the RFIM stems from its similarities to real materials, such as diluted antiferromagnets or spin glasses. For instance, the presence of quenched disorder leads to effects reminiscent of those observed in spin-glass systems. Additionally, the RFIM exhibits a rich variety of phases depending on the strength of the external magnetic field. At low fields, the system is in a paramagnetic phase, while above a certain threshold \\( H \\sim O(J) \\), the spins align with the external field, resulting in a ferromagnetic state. If the external field exceeds another threshold \\( H_t > H_c \\), the magnetization becomes discontinuous. These three regimes are separated by two second-order phase transitions occurring at temperatures \\( T_{c1} < 0 \\) and \\( T_{c2} > 0 \\). However, despite the similarities between the RFIM and other systems, the precise nature of the stationary phase remains an open question.",

This trend can be attributed to the fact that most star-forming galaxies were actively forming stars at redshifts around z ~ 3, making them appear redder than their earlier counterparts; consequently, more galaxies contribute to the red-sequence population at higher redshifts.

The new data reveal extended emission around both TeV sources which is not detected by previous surveys. We discuss possible scenarios for this emission based on our results as well as those obtained recently by other authors. In particular we propose that the observed structures are due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven by stellar winds interacting within these clusters. This scenario would also explain why no X-ray counterparts have been found so far despite deep searches carried out with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Finally, we estimate the magnetic field strength required to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Cygnus OB2 association contains more than 100 OB stars distributed over an area of about 50 square degrees centered at l = 80°and b = 1° (  Fig.   1a ). It has been suggested that many of them could be members of binary systems or even multiple systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010) . These objects can drive powerful winds into their surroundings creating strong shocks where particles may be accelerated up to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shock fronts they will interact with photons coming from the surrounding interstellar medium producing high-energy electromagnetic radiation detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV range. \n \n Several studies suggest that several of the known TeV sources in the sky might be related to young open clusters like Cyg OB2 (see e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a ,b, 2007a .

Our data reveals extended emission surrounding both TeV sources, which is not captured by previous studies. We explore potential scenarios for this emission based on our findings and those recently reported by other researchers. Specifically, we suggest that the observed structures may result from synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks generated by interactions within these regions. This could explain the absence of X-ray counterparts, despite extensive observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Additionally, we estimate the magnetic field required to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries.\n\nIntroduction: The Cygnus OB2 association contains over 100 OB stars spread across approximately 50 square degrees, centered at l = 80° and b = 1° (see Fig. 1a). It has been proposed that many of these stars may be part of binary systems or even multiple star groups (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010). These systems can generate powerful winds that interact with their surroundings, creating strong shocks where particles can be accelerated to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shocks, they may interact with photons from the surrounding interstellar medium, producing high-energy emissions detectable across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including TeV gamma rays. Several studies suggest that many known TeV sources may be linked to regions like Cyg OB2 (see, for example, Aharonian et al. 2005a, b, 2007a). However, only a few of these associations have been thoroughly investigated through optical, infrared, spectroscopy, and/or continuum observations (see, for instance, Reimer & Böttcher 2006; Castro-Tirado et al.).",

The findings indicate that in the Λ-CDM model without DE, the growth rate of large-scale structures declines rapidly in the later stages due to the influence of CDM. Conversely, when DE is included under the same initial conditions, the growth remains consistent over time. This suggests that the presence of DE can significantly impact the formation of large-scale structures on extensive scales. Additionally, we observe that the density profiles of structures in these two scenarios exhibit notable differences. These results imply that it may be beneficial to investigate the relationship between these two models by examining cluster properties, such as mass functions and X-ray luminosities. \n\nKeywords: Cold dark matter; Dark energy; Growth rate; Clustering statistics; Density profiles; Cosmology.",

We discuss how to frame this problem as a statistical inference task, incorporating priors that encode information about the underlying matter distribution.

Specifically, we focus on two different approaches based on Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Additionally, we describe applications of these methods to simulated datasets.

These observations have provided compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter and have placed stringent constraints on various parameters related to the physics of the early universe. However, despite these successes, several fundamental questions remain regarding the standard model of cosmology. One such question pertains to dark matter: What is its composition? What is its mass? How does it interact with ordinary matter? Addressing these questions necessitates a detailed understanding of the spatial distribution of dark matter throughout cosmic history. Unfortunately, direct experiments often fall short in providing this information, as they typically only reveal the gravitational effects of dark matter.

This article draws heavily from two studies conducted at various universities across Europe between 2004 and 2006. The results indicate that there has been little change in the overall perception of privacy since 2004. Students continue to express significant concerns about their personal information being shared without their consent or control. However, some variations were noted among different countries. Additionally, the findings suggest that gender and age play a role in shaping these attitudes.

Introduction\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that luminous red galaxies (LRGs), identified through their optical properties or near-infrared photometry, serve as powerful probes for large-scale structure investigations extending to high redshifts (e.g., Eisenstein et al. 2001; Wake et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2007; Blake et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2008).

This problem is relevant in various contexts, such as biological systems, molecular dynamics, and granular gases. In this study, we focus on the two-species symmetric exclusion process (TCSP), which consists of two types of indistinguishable particles, A and B, that move according to specific rules. Particles of type A and B independently hop on a ring of L sites, alternating between neighboring sites with a certain probability. If both types of particles attempt to occupy the same site simultaneously, one of them will move forward while the other remains in place, depending on their respective densities. It is important to note that these dynamics conserve the number of each type of particle separately, but not their total number, N = nA + nB.

These messages can be viewed by all followers of the user, potentially leading to further dissemination of the content within the network. This phenomenon is often referred to as viral marketing and has been extensively studied. However, many questions about the dynamics of this process remain unanswered. In this study, we focus on analyzing cascades within large blogging communities, where each node represents a blogger and the edges connect pairs of blogs that share the same content. A cascade begins when a blogger writes a post that includes a URL linking to another blog. If their followers click on the link, they will visit the other blog and may explore additional posts. As illustrated in Figure 1, the resulting graph showcases several interconnected nodes representing different topics discussed by community members.",

This issue was addressed by Snyder, who proposed a type of coordinate transformation leading to a deformed Poincaré algebra.

Such deformations result in modifications to the standard dispersion relations and significantly affect the properties of matter fields. Recently, it has been suggested that introducing a minimal length scale into the framework of gravitational theories could help resolve the black hole information paradox. Another interesting aspect is that the deformation parameter \\( \\theta_{ij} \\) can be chosen so that its magnitude decreases rapidly with increasing distance.

INTRODUCTION**  \nIn many applications, accurately determining the position where a photon strikes a detector is crucial. This is particularly important when designing optical instruments like telescopes. To evaluate the spatial resolution of a detector, we need reference points against which we can compare our experimental data. One method to establish these reference points is to use a light source emitting photons at a controlled angle relative to the normal direction. If the detector has no intrinsic spatial resolution, all photons will originate from a defined area around the center of the detector surface. By varying the detector's angle, we can determine the fraction of total counts originating from different parts of the detector. We refer to these fractions as the response function R(θ) of the detector. Understanding the characteristics of this response function allows us to assess the spatial resolution of the detector. However, when multiple pixels are involved at a given angle, the situation becomes more complex, as several pixels may detect the same photon. To address this issue, we introduce a joint probability P_ij that indicates the likelihood of the i-th and j-th pixels detecting a photon simultaneously.

The smallness of the cosmological constant remains one of the greatest challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. It is widely believed that quantum gravity will be crucial in explaining why the energy density associated with vacuum fluctuations is significantly smaller than one would naively expect. Several attempts have been made to tackle this issue within the context of Loop Quantum Gravity, but many have failed to yield satisfactory results. In particular, the findings in previous studies do not consistently align with each other or with current experimental constraints. Here, we propose a new approach based on recent developments in the field. Our key insight is that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, derived from the canonical formulation of general relativity, can be related to the Schrödinger equation when applied to macroscopic states. As demonstrated in previous work, these equations can be modified due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom associated with the gravitational field itself.",
