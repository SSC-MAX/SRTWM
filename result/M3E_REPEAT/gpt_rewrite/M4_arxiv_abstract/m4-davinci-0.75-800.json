INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe contact process, which models the spread of infectious diseases or computer viruses, plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, ranging from statistical mechanics to epidemiology. It serves as a paradigmatic example for studying self-Griffiths criticality. In recent years, several approaches have been developed to refine the original formulation of the contact process by incorporating factors such as spatial constraints, variations in connectivity, memory effects, and heterogeneities. These modifications arise from the understanding that real-world processes display complex topological features and can evolve dynamically over time. Nevertheless, despite these advancements, a comprehensive solution to the contact process remains elusive. Recently, analytical techniques have emerged to better understand the contact process on complex topologies. Among these, the series expansion method offers a robust framework for investigating properties of the model near the epidemic threshold. This approach has enabled us to derive expressions for critical quantities, including the generating function and the second moments of the infected population in the steady state, and to establish scaling laws governing the approach to equilibrium.",

These properties include high reflectivity, unique refractive indices, and potential for nonlinear optical effects, making them suitable for various applications such as optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics. Recent studies have demonstrated that multilayers composed of anisotropic materials exhibit interesting electromagnetic phenomena associated with SWR. This effect occurs when the group velocity of the Bloch waves approaches zero in certain regions. It is linked to the possibility of achieving large effective refractive indices \\( n_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{v_{\\text{ph}}} \\), where \\( \\epsilon \\) represents the permittivity of the material and \\( v_{\\text{ph}} \\) is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave. Consequently, the transmission spectrum of these structures displays narrow stop bands, which are useful for many practical applications.

One of the most fascinating phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It has been demonstrated that when the number of electrons \\(N\\) is odd, the lowest Landau level (LLL) accommodates only one electron for each magnetic flux quantum. FQHEs have garnered significant interest as they provide a unique platform to explore many-body effects in condensed matter physics. Recently, several researchers have investigated the properties of the modified Coulomb interaction between two oppositely charged particles moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to their path. They found that the ground state behavior critically depends on whether the total angular momentum \\(J = L + S\\) is zero or not, where \\(L\\) represents the orbital angular momentum and \\(S\\) is the spin angular momentum. For the case when \\(J = 0\\), the ground state energy is given by \\(E_0 = -\\frac{e^2}{l_B} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\\), where \\(l_B = \\frac{eB}{mc}\\) is the magnetic length.

However, HGT can also disrupt existing genetic interactions and contribute to the introduction of deleterious mutations. Therefore, understanding the impact of HGT on population dynamics necessitates a nuanced approach. Previous research has proposed that HGT may benefit populations in fluctuating environments while posing risks for those in stable ones. In this work, we apply computational models to investigate these hypotheses further, concluding that HGT can either enhance or diminish fitness depending on the specific environmental context experienced by cell populations.",

In contrast, when the wavevectors are not aligned, we observe that nonlocal effects become significant due to the presence of oblique interactions. The insights gained from this study contribute to our understanding of turbulent transport phenomena in astrophysical contexts. Turbulence plays a crucial role in various dynamic systems, ranging from geophysical to astrophysical processes. Recent research has demonstrated that universal properties exist among different types of turbulent flows, including Kolmogorov scaling, intermittency, and anomalous dissipation. It has been particularly noted that the statistics of fully developed turbulence are heavily influenced by the rate at which energy cascades down through the inertial range. This energy cascade involves both linear and nonlinear interactions among different modes at varying wavenumbers. For example, in hydrodynamics, the energy spectrum Π(k) is defined as <|δuk · δu*-k|²> / <|uk|²>, where δu represents velocity fluctuations at wavenumber k. When the angle θ = arccos(k · v0) / |k||v0| between the wavevector k and the large-scale velocity v0 is small, on the order of θ ≈ 1, the spectrum behaves as Π(k) ∝ k^(-2/3)θ^(2/3).

Most GRBs exhibit a prompt emission phase followed by a power-law decay lasting several hundred seconds, consistent with the afterglow observations (Costa et al. 1997; van Paradijs et al. 1997). This behavior can be explained by synchrotron radiation emitted from electrons that are accelerated behind the shock wave generated when the ejecta interacts with the surrounding medium (Sari et al. 1998).

Various models have been proposed to account for these observed phenomena, including late-time engine activity (Zhang 2007b), refreshed-shock scenarios (Ghisellini et al. 2007), and reverse shock emission (Kobayashi 2000; Kobayashi & Sari 2001).

Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2.

Evidence suggests that they exist in pairs or even triplets, indicating that SBHs undergo multiple merger events. During these mergers, SBHs can change their angular momentum due to gravitational wave emission. Consequently, they will ultimately merge into a single black hole. The process of merging involves two rotating black holes orbiting each other. Due to the strong gravitational fields near the merger, the Kerr metric should be utilized instead of standard general relativity. However, since the orbits of the merging black holes are often highly eccentric, the effects of higher-order corrections to the Kerr solution become significant. These corrections encompass both post-Newtonian terms and those arising from nonlinear gravitational effects. It has been demonstrated that these corrections contribute to the precession of the orbital planes. Specifically, if the initial spin axes of the two black holes are aligned but point in opposite directions, the orbital plane will precess around the total angular momentum vector. If the initial spin orientations are misaligned with the total angular momentum vector, the orbital trajectory may undergo more complex rotations.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present new constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models by analyzing data from two recent observations of gravitationally lensed quasars: SDSS and CFHTLS Wide. Our findings suggest that the observed density of lenses aligns with predictions from collaboration dark matter simulations but is inconsistent with a standard thermal relic WDM model with a mass of \\( m_X = 1 \\, \\text{keV} \\) at over 3 sigma confidence. This discrepancy indicates that either current WDM theories need to be revised or that there are other factors not accounted for in our analysis. The full text can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604070v1.pdf. \n\nThe existence of dark matter has been established beyond reasonable doubt due to its gravitational influence on visible matter. However, despite significant research, our understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon remains limited. It is still unclear whether dark matter consists of a single type of particle—as commonly assumed in many models—or if it is composed of several different types. One possibility is that dark matter is made up of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), such as neutralinos predicted by supersymmetry within the Standard Model. \n\nTo explore these scenarios observationally, astronomers are keenly investigating astrophysical phenomena such as galaxy clusters and quasars. A particularly promising method involves searching for gravitationally lensed sources affected by intervening dark matter halos. If dark matter consists of WIMPs, their masses should range between \\( 10 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\) and \\( 100 \\, \\text{TeV}/c^2 \\). For example, the recently discovered galaxy cluster Abell 2218 has been suggested to contain a halo that is entirely composed of WIMPs.",

When multiple users share a common resource, such as bandwidth or transmit power, the optimal way to distribute these resources depends on various factors, such as the relative priority of the users and the types of services they require. Consequently, efficient resource allocation strategies must consider all relevant aspects to maximize overall system performance. \n\nSignificant research has been dedicated to exploring various facets of resource allocation, particularly in relation to power allocation, due to its critical influence on spectral efficiency and energy consumption. However, much of the existing work focuses on continuous input signals, while practical modulation schemes typically utilize discrete constellations. This limitation makes standard approaches inapplicable to practical input scenarios. To address this gap, several recent studies have investigated power allocation issues for Jurassic input channels.

INTRODUCTION**\nThe concept of droplet excitations was originally formulated within the framework of mean-field theory. It describes how local perturbations can influence the overall properties of a system. This idea has proven to be especially valuable in understanding disordered systems such as spin glasses, supercooled liquids, and vortex lattices. Specifically, it has facilitated the exploration of various aspects of the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin glasses. However, despite its accomplishments, the original droplet picture has several significant limitations: first, it does not adequately account for fluctuations around the critical point solution; second, it predicts a non-zero density of droplets even at absolute zero; and third, it fails to accurately describe the critical behavior of the system. To address these shortcomings, various modifications have been proposed. One notable approach involves refining the expression for the free energy per site, where the free energy density of the system is characterized by parameters that account for the associated droplet volume.",

We show that SQM is equivalent to the usual quantum mechanics for periodic boundary condition case. In addition we find that there are two different types of supersymmetric ground states depending on whether or not the number of particles N is even. For odd N , the ground state has zero energy but it does not have any degeneracy. On the other hand, when N is even, the ground state becomes doubly degenerate. The degeneracy can be understood by using the concept of parity symmetry breaking. Finally we discuss how our result fits into the general framework of supersymmetry.

They demonstrated that these models showcase numerous intriguing properties, such as spontaneous dimerization at low temperatures. The primary focus of this work is to investigate the impact of boundary conditions on the supersymmetric structure of the systems.

For example, if the gravitational field of a distant galaxy lives outside the 3-brane but inside the bulk, then its gravitational force would act upon us even though the galaxy itself does not appear directly in front of us  18  .

We demonstrate how this model applies to both accelerating and decelerating universes with a positive cosmological constant. Our framework predicts an accelerating expansion rate at late times, alongside a decelerated expansion at earlier stages, which aligns well with current observations. Additionally, we find that the value of the Hubble parameter, H0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, is consistent with our theory. Finally, we discuss potential experimental tests of our model, including the SNAP satellite project. \n\nIntroduction: The phenomenon of the accelerated expansion of the universe has been recognized recently. It was discovered that the expansion rate appears to increase, which cannot be solely attributed to normal matter, suggesting the existence of additional forms of dark energy. However, the exact nature of the underlying mechanisms remains largely unexplained. Many models have been proposed to account for this observed phenomenon. In this letter, we put forward a novel approach based on the concept of extra dimensions. In our framework, our four-dimensional universe is embedded in a three-brane situated within a five-dimensional bulk. If gravity can propagate into this bulk, it could influence the dynamics of matter on the three-brane. Furthermore, if certain matter exists in the bulk but outside the three-brane, its gravitational effects may still exert influence on us, even if that matter itself is not directly observable. Thus, the presence of extra dimensions could lead to significant implications beyond those predicted by general relativity.",

A critical aspect of their physics involves understanding how various objects behave in their vicinity. Recent studies have revealed intriguing dynamics happening near the event horizon. For example, when a charged particle approaches a Reissner-Nordström black hole, it experiences significant effects due to the photon sphere present in such systems. If the charge is sufficiently strong, the particle may eventually fall into the black hole after emitting photons. Another fascinating phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole, where its trajectory is again influenced by the photon sphere. However, unlike cases involving Reissner-Nordström black holes, the Kerr black hole affects not only photons but also gravitons. In regard to this topic, research has been conducted on the behavior of fields outside black holes. Specifically, one area of interest is determining the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs), which represent the characteristic frequencies associated with these systems.",

Finally, we demonstrate that our simulations predict a correlation between the direction of the warp and the angular momentum vector of the host halo.",

This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

However, these measurements can be problematic because they heavily depend on the assumed luminosity values. For example, if we assume a luminosity that is too high, the calculated distance will be underestimated. Conversely, if we assume a luminosity that is too low, the resulting distance will be overestimated.

One effective way to address this issue is to identify distance indicators whose properties can be verified independently through other methods. These indicators include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources found in star-forming regions. Among these, maser sources are particularly valuable, as they offer very precise distance measurements. Maser sources are typically associated with dense molecular clouds where gas condenses into tiny crystalline structures akin to ice. When these crystalline structures grow larger than about one micron, they amplify radiation and begin emitting coherent radiation. Since the emission line widths of maser sources are much narrower compared to those of standard radio sources, they yield highly accurate measurements.",

We propose that this transition can be studied by measuring the sizes of avalanches triggered by local perturbations. The results show significant differences when compared to those obtained from unperturbed CIM, using Monte Carlo simulations on large lattices. Notably, we observe that the distribution of avalanche sizes changes dramatically across the transition point. This behavior is explained through the recently developed mean-field theory for the CIM. Lastly, we explore potential experimental realizations of our findings.\n\n**Introduction:** The phenomenon of phase coexistence has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. It occurs when different thermodynamic states exist in equilibrium or when metastable states are present simultaneously. A classic example is water, where ice Ih and liquid water coexist below 0°C. Recent studies have focused on understanding how different phases separate and evolve under external driving forces such as thermal fluctuations, magnetic fields, and mechanical stress. These investigations have been inspired by experiments conducted on a variety of materials, including ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, superconductors, colloids, granular materials, glasses, and foams. For example, it has been found that the behavior of domain walls in magnets heavily depends on whether they are pinned or not. Similarly, the response of glassy materials to shear is significantly influenced by their history. However, the effects of quenched disorder on material properties remain poorly understood, despite numerous studies conducted in recent years. The investigation of this area is gaining renewed interest due to the emergence of various types of phases occurring in spatially organized systems.",

In Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function is understood as representing our knowledge about the system rather than its intrinsic properties. This implies that upon making a measurement, the outcome updates our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem. For instance, if Alice performs a measurement of her particle's spin along the x-axis, she will revise her expectations based on the obtained value. If Bob then measures the spin of his particle along the same axis and receives a different result, this will lead him to adjust his knowledge and reevaluate the implications of his measurement.",

Nevertheless, several intriguing questions remain regarding the properties of this newly discovered state, including its relationship to a larger multiplet. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), each SM particle is paired with a superpartner that differs solely in spin. If R-parity is conserved, superpartners must be produced in pairs. One implication of this framework is the potential existence of multiple Higgs doublets. Specifically, if the scalar Higgs boson observed at the LHC corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate (h⁰) of a more extensive multiplet, the heavier CP-eigenstates (H⁰ and A⁰) could couple strongly to fermions. Such configurations could lead to significant signatures for decays of these states into detectable photons. To investigate potential deviations from the predictions of the SM, precise measurements of the masses and couplings of the predicted Higgs bosons are essential.",

Our findings indicate that, for sufficiently deep SILs and low temperatures, the atom can be confined within a distance of one lattice constant from the surface with high fidelity. In this regime, we show that the lifetime of the atom's excited state is influenced by its coupling to specialized phonons through the deformation potential mechanism. The resulting lifetimes are found to vary significantly with parameters for cesium atoms trapped in a geometry formed by two dielectric surfaces. Surface optical lattices have been widely utilized in trapping ultracold atoms near surfaces, providing unique opportunities to explore various many-body phenomena such as superfluidity, supersolids, and topological insulators through cold-atom experiments. In these studies, laser light is directed onto the surface of a substrate, creating potential wells along the lattice structure.

Within these lattices, atoms experience strong confinement perpendicular to the surface while remaining coupled to the substrate beneath. Consequently, they behave similarly to free particles moving in three dimensions.

Introduction\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that luminous red galaxies (LRGs), selected through their optical colors or near-infrared photometry, are powerful probes of large-scale structures, extending to high redshifts (e.g., Eisenstein et al. 2001; Wake et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2007; Blake et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2008). Their considerable luminosities enable detection even at relatively low redshifts, while their distinct red colors facilitate easy identification in spectroscopic observations. LRGs are believed to reside in massive dark matter halos that evolve slowly over cosmic time, making them valuable tracers of the underlying mass distribution. Consequently, they offer unique opportunities to study both the growth of cosmic structures and the mechanisms driving the accelerated expansion of the universe (see, e.g., Percival & White 2009, for more on this topic). In this paper, we report our measurement of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs in the redshift range 0 < z < 0.8, utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (Colless et al.).",

For instance, magnetic ordering in solids occurs due to the strong interactions between individual atomic magnetic moments. Similarly, liquid helium exhibits superfluidity at temperatures below its critical point of T = 2.17 K due to the formation of bound pairs of helium-4 atoms, known as Cooper pairs. These examples emphasize that understanding collective behavior necessitates the study of large ensembles rather than isolated components. However, simulating the macroscopic properties of large systems poses significant challenges in theoretical physics. While the microscopic interactions between individual particles can often be accurately described by quantum mechanics, the macroscopic characteristics of large assemblies typically require approximations that capture the effects arising from correlations between different parts of the system. Consequently, simulations of large-scale models of real materials are frequently conducted using Monte Carlo methods.

Our approach is based on two key ideas: 1) We use a new adaptive strategy to select representative sequences from different subfamilies by considering both the diversity among them as well as their evolutionary relationships; 2) We develop a new scoring scheme which takes into account not only the pairwise sequence similarities but also the structural information between query and template sequences.

The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes.

Furthermore, from general arguments, it follows that all correlation functions of these operators factor into products of two-point correlators: \\(\\langle O_i(x) O_j(y) \\rangle = C_{ij} f(x - y)\\), where \\(C_{ij}\\) is a constant dependent solely on the positions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within the underlying geometry.

At this stage, the droplets become optically opaque, and their growth continues, eventually leading to the formation of larger aggregates called micelles.

In particular, we investigate two different models: the damped harmonic oscillator in relation to Ohmic dissipation and the spin-boson model. For both scenarios, we demonstrate how the presence of the external environment leads to irreversible changes in the density of the system, affecting both the initial state and the system's thermalization over time. Additionally, we explore applications of our model in contexts such as electron transport through mesoscopic conductors and dissipative tunneling between localized states in disordered materials. Decoherence and dissipation are key to understanding the physics in these environments, especially when the system interacts with external degrees of freedom (the environment) whose influences might otherwise be overlooked. In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing approaches that can address these effects beyond perturbative methods. A variety of strategies have been proposed, ranging from phenomenological methods based on stochastic Schrödinger equations to microscopic descriptions using path integrals or field-theoretic formulations. Nevertheless, despite their effectiveness, these methods commonly share a significant limitation: they do not clarify the fundamental mechanisms behind decoherence and dissipation, nor do they facilitate understanding of the timescales involved. Recently, several researchers have suggested that this issue can be approached within the framework of quantum mechanics itself. This concept was first put forth by Feynman, who demonstrated that the macroscopic properties of a system could be understood by averaging over an ensemble of identical but microscopically distinct iterations of the same experiment. More recently, Leggett proposed a method to further explore these ideas.",

Introduction  \nSpace weather has gained significant attention recently due to its impact on various aspects of daily life, such as satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. In particular, solar wind plays a crucial role in space weather as it influences magnetic fields generated by the Sun's dynamo and subsequently affects the Earth's magnetosphere. Solar wind is emitted from the Sun during events like coronal mass ejections, which occur when large amounts of plasma are expelled from the Sun's surface. These ejections can last several hours, resulting in significant fluctuations in solar wind over a 24-hour period.

This article explores one such interpretation through the lenses of statistical mechanics and information theory. The premise is that entropy reflects the degree of uncertainty related to a given state of a system (or the absence of such a state). Entropy rises when there are more possible states, making it harder to predict the system's behavior. In this context, entropy quantifies how our knowledge diminishes as we gain new insights about the world around us. \n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that entropy tends to increase over time.

To explore this question, let’s consider two different systems, A and B, both in equilibrium. System A has only one possible configuration, while System B has numerous configurations. If we could observe the two systems, we would find they possess the same overall energy and temperature. However, if our observation is limited to a narrow viewpoint, we might conclude that System A appears to have a higher temperature than System B due to the uncertainty about its future behavior. \n\nNow, let's allow System A to evolve into System C, where all configurations are perfectly uniform. We would find that System C is colder than System A, even though their energies remain unchanged.

        "rewrite_text": "We are investigating the northeastern function of the coupling constant for the AdS5 × S5 superstring, which has been found to be proportional to the corresponding value for the bosonic case. This suggests that there are no nontrivial fixed points at any finite value of the coupling constant. Our analysis reveals that the dilaton indeed has an imaginary component when we consider higher-order corrections beyond the leading terms. This implies that our results are only valid in a limited region of parameter space where the imaginary part of the dilaton can be ignored. This study is motivated by the work on gauge/gravity correspondence in relation to N = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with 16 supercharges and type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5. In this context, the presence of nontrivial fixed points is associated with the conformal invariance of the dual SYM theory, while the imaginary part of the dilatonic scalar fields indicates potential instability in the theory. Previous studies have calculated the northeastern functions for both the metric tensor and the dilaton using the Green-Schwarz formalism. They discovered that these functions do not vanish even when evaluated at zero coupling constants, but their calculations assumed that all fermionic contributions vanish identically. However, this assumption is not accurate. Therefore, it is essential to carry out a more detailed analysis that considers the effects of fermions, as well as those from the bosons.",

Our results show significant improvements over existing methods, particularly for applications requiring dynamic load balancing.

Parallel computing is increasingly important due to its capacity to handle larger data sets than traditional computing methods. However, these advancements can lead to challenges in data redistribution between multiple processors. To maximize the benefits of parallelism, many algorithms are designed to operate concurrently across several cores. Unfortunately, this can create complications with data redistribution during execution, especially in scenarios where each processor holds a portion of a dataset (e.g., a matrix). If the dataset size changes at runtime, processors must be informed about which portions of the dataset they own before proceeding.

A key challenge in these endeavors is protecting qubits from environmental noise. It has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that interactions between different parts of a circuit can lead to deleterious effects, such as dephasing and energy loss. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when managing large networks of superconducting qubits. In this work, we examine a setup consisting of two weakly coupled SQUIDs immersed in a phonon bath. Our goal is to explore how the interaction contributes to the properties of the reduced density matrix of each SQUID independently.

Specifically, we will concentrate on the Groenewold-Moyal algebra, which is characterized by two non-commuting coordinates that satisfy the commutation relation \\( q^\\mu(x), q^\\nu(y) = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} q_\\rho(xy) \\). We will demonstrate how to define a covariant differential operator that acts on fields situated within the Groenewold-Moyal framework. This allows us to introduce a notion of spinor fields in the Groenewold-Moyal plane. Additionally, we will discuss the construction of gauge-invariant actions for these fields. Finally, we will analyze the effects of discrete symmetries, specifically charge conjugation (C), parity (P), time reversal (T), and their combinations.",

They can also be used to test the validity of factorization theorems, which connect hard scattering cross sections to parton distribution functions within the proton.

This research utilizes one-tenths, fully compressible simulations with realistic equations of state and opacities. We find that the influence is significant for low-order g-modes, but negligible for high-order ones. The frequency shifts are found to be proportional to the inertia of the oscillation modes, which can be estimated by fitting the numerically obtained eigenfunctions to those calculated analytically under the thin-shell approximation. For typical parameters relevant to ZZ Ceti stars, we estimate the resultant frequency shift due to Coriolis forces to be about 0.1% at most. This suggests that such effects might be neglected when interpreting the observed frequencies of pulsating white dwarf stars. However, further analysis should be conducted using more sophisticated models that consider both rotation and magnetic fields.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe study of luminescence phenomena has garnered significant attention over the years due to its capacity to provide insights into the electronic structure and optical properties of solids. Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), often referred to as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly valuable as it allows us to investigate the dynamics of electrons excited into the conduction band. A substantial number of studies have employed specialized models to explore different aspects of luminescence, including the mechanisms underlying thermal stimulation luminescence. However, most of these investigations have largely relied on the assumption that the system remains in a state close to equilibrium. Consequently, they fail to accurately describe certain critical features observed experimentally. For instance, the shape of the TSL curves depends significantly on the type of material: while insulators typically exhibit a single peak, semiconductors often display multiple features. Additionally, even within the same class of materials, such as semiconductor crystals, the characteristics of these curves can vary based on doping levels. These phenomena cannot be fully explained using existing theoretical frameworks.",

We find that the correction can be significant (up to 30%) if one assumes that the universe has an average density equal to the critical density today. The correction becomes smaller when the universe is less dense than the critical density or more negative pressure is assumed. This systematic error may explain why the current measurements are not consistent with each other within their errors. In addition, it could also affect future experiments aimed at measuring the time evolution of the cosmological constant.

Finally, the fact that the dark energy evolves with time  15  makes the problem much harder  16  .\nOne way to overcome these problems is to measure directly the equation-of-state w(z), defined as  17  \nwhere p de and ρ de are respectively the pressure and density of the dark energy.

        "rewrite_text": "We find that the observed value of the cosmological constant is systematically affected by the presence of matter in our surroundings, and we examine this effect across different models of the universe. Our analysis suggests that the correction could be significant (up to 30%) if one assumes that the dark energy has a density comparable to the critical density. The correction diminishes when the matter density is less than the critical density or if more negative values for the cosmological constant are considered. This discrepancy helps explain why current observations of the universe do not align with one another within their error margins. Additionally, it may impact experiments designed to measure the time evolution of the cosmological constant. \n\nThe accelerated expansion of our universe implies the existence of some form of dark energy, prompting questions about its nature. One hypothesis is that dark energy behaves like a cosmological constant, while another suggests it may include components like axions. To investigate these models observationally, we require precise measurements of the properties of dark energy. However, this task comes with several complications. For instance, the day-to-day variations in measurements are considerably less pronounced compared to the Hubble parameter \\(H_0 = 100h\\, \\text{km/s/Mpc}\\), where \\(h \\approx 0.7 \\pm 0.1\\). Nonetheless, the literature shows significant variability regarding distance measurements that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, since dark energy evolves both spatially and temporally, it influences the rate of cosmic clocks and introduces uncertainty into distance estimates. Finally, the fact that dark energy evolves over time adds to the challenges involved.\n\nOne approach to mitigate these issues is to parameterize the equation of state \\(w(z)\\), where \\(w\\) is related to the energy density and pressure of dark energy. If dark energy behaves like a perfect fluid, then \\(w(z) \\equiv -1\\). Recent studies have shown that the frame of reference we use to assess these characteristics is crucial for our understanding.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with powerful supernovae (e.g., Woosley & Bloom, 2006). If this connection holds, it implies that a portion of the ejected material remains influenced by the surrounding environment, which can significantly affect the dynamics of the explosion and the properties of the resulting afterglow. For instance, Chevalier et al. (2004) demonstrated that if the density of the surrounding medium follows a power-law distribution, the resulting afterglow would exhibit a steep decline in brightness. This behavior has been supported by observational data (e.g., Panaitescu, 2005; Kumar & Panaitescu, 2008), leading to the conclusion that many GRBs originate from such progenitors (e.g., Zhang, 2007). However, some researchers have contested this view both theoretically (e.g., Ramirez-Ruiz et al., 2005) and observationally (e.g., Lazzati et al., 2009). It is important to note that while GRBs tend to follow this general pattern, there are instances where the interaction with a wind-like medium is not clearly observed.",

The basic idea behind these constructions is that they involve branes moving through extra dimensions of space-time. These branes may either move towards each other or away from each other depending on their initial conditions. If two branes collide then it leads to a rapid expansion of spacetime known as  inflation . This process continues until the branes separate again and the universe reverts back to its original size.

We use the exact diagonalization method to calculate the density-density correlation function and static structure factor as well as their corresponding sum rules. The results show that there are two different regimes depending on whether the temperature T is larger or smaller than the Fermi energy EF . In particular, we find that when T < EF , the behavior of these quantities can be understood within the framework of Landau s Fermi liquid theory.

The analysis reveals that there is no significant discrepancy between the charge correlation functions calculated from different collision types, except for notable differences in the midrapidity region, which may be attributed to initial state effects. It is observed that the charge correlation function decreases as the center-of-mass energy increases, indicating that charge fluctuations become more significant when transitioning from lower to higher energies. Additionally, the charge correlation functions obtained in this study correspond well with those measured experimentally. PACS numbers: 25.75.-e, 11.15.-x, 12.38.Mh. \n\nElectric charge fluctuations are critical for understanding various intriguing phenomena observed in heavy-ion collisions, including charge balance functions and related charge fluctuations. Numerous experiments have focused on these subjects, exploring collision types from proton-proton (pp) to deuteron-gold (d-Au) and gold-gold (Au-Au). This wealth of data provides valuable insights into the properties of dense nuclear matter under high-energy conditions. However, theoretical studies in this area remain limited. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of these charges, we aim to investigate charge fluctuation phenomena in greater detail. One effective approach to studying charge fluctuations is through the measurement of charge correlation functions. Recently, several studies have reported measurements of charge correlation functions in p + p, d + Au, and Au + Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. In comparison, models such as the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) and the parton-hadron collaboration model (PHSD) predict a rapid decrease in charge correlation functions near zero pT.",

        "rewrite_text": "Gravastars are hypothetical objects proposed as alternatives to black holes, theorized to exist in a state distinct from the well-known formation of black holes. One way to differentiate gravastars from black holes is by examining their gravitational lensing effects on light from distant sources. In this study, we explore how these varying lensing behaviors could be utilized to distinguish between gravastars and black holes, using data collected from advanced telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope - Astrophysics (WFIRST-AFTA). Gravitational lenses serve as powerful tools for investigating distant astronomical phenomena, as they can magnify the light from background sources. The Einstein ring is a well-known example of gravitational lensing, occurring when a massive object passes closely to the line of sight of a more distant object. However, many other types of lensing effects can arise from various mass distributions, including those caused by galaxy clusters, individual galaxies, and even cosmic matter halos. Gravitational lensing provides crucial information about the masses of both the foreground and background objects involved. For example, by estimating the distance to a background object and analyzing the lensing effects caused by a foreground object, we can deduce the mass of the foreground object based on the observed characteristics of the lensed light. This method has been successfully applied to determine the masses of supermassive black holes at the centers of nearby galaxies. Gravitational lensing occurs whenever light travels through regions of varying gravitational influence, making it observable whenever gravity departs significantly from Newtonian predictions. Black holes, which exhibit strong gravitational effects as predicted by general relativity near their event horizons, produce significant deviations from Newtonian behavior. In contrast, gravastars do not adhere to general relativity outside their surfaces.",

Its presence has been inferred primarily through its gravitational effects on galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other cosmic structures, while direct detection experiments have thus far been unsuccessful. Numerous models of cold dark matter (CDM) exist, but very few have been experimentally validated. One of the theories suggests that DM consists of elementary particles. If these particles interact electromagnetically with ordinary matter, they may escape detection unless they are near large structures. Conversely, if they interact strongly enough with normal matter, they could be observable. Various experiments aimed at detecting DM have been conducted. Recently, the DAMA collaboration reported significant results, noting an annual modulation likely caused by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, leading to an increase in nuclear recoils detected from June to October compared to December to February. This phenomenon cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics. Several researchers have proposed alternative models to account for these observations.",

Originally introduced to explain the physics of heavy fermion systems, it has been found to have broader applications. The initial investigation focuses on the case where the coupling constant J is considered, specifically the critical value Jc = 2t / U, where t denotes the hopping amplitude between neighboring sites and U represents the Coulomb repulsion. At zero temperature, the ground state of the Kondo model tends toward a ferromagnetic order, while at finite temperatures, a continuous quantum phase transition to a paramagnetic state is anticipated. This transition is attributed to strong spin fluctuations and belongs to the same universality class as the Heisenberg model. However, there are significant differences between the two models: the Kondo model supports two types of excitations—spinons and holons—whereas the Heisenberg model only features spin-1/2 excitations. Furthermore, the Kondo necklace model has abrupt phase transitions related to charge carriers. These characteristics lead to phenomena not observed in the Heisenberg model. Additionally, the Kondo necklace can exhibit superconducting states under certain conditions.",

This proposed IA scheme leverages both spatial multiplexing gains and multiuser diversity. Specifically, it enables different users to communicate their signals over non-overlapping time-frequency resources while optimizing spatial reuse among them.",

This star has been extensively studied over many years, as it is located relatively close (5 pc) to our Sun but was previously thought not to harbor any planets. Thus, it is particularly interesting because its properties can now be compared against theoretical models of planetary formation and evolution. \n\nKeywords: Planetary systems - Formation, Solar System\n\nThe discovery of extrasolar planets has provided valuable insights into how these systems form and evolve. However, the majority of exoplanets have been detected using indirect methods such as transit photometry or Doppler spectroscopy. These techniques offer limited information, primarily regarding the orbital parameters of the planets, while direct imaging provides more precise constraints on their physical characteristics. In particular, high-contrast imaging allows us to detect the masses of companions down to very low mass ratios in relation to their parent stars. In recent years, there has been significant progress towards achieving high-contrast imaging capabilities to detect Earth-like planets around nearby stars. Notable instruments such as the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI; Macintosh et al., 2014), SPHERE (Beuzit et al., 2008), and SCExAO (Jovanovic et al., 2015) are set to commence operations on 8-10 m class telescopes. These facilities offer unprecedented sensitivity and high resolution, enabling them to explore regions closer to the primary stars where such planets are more likely to exist. However, these observatories utilize different techniques and technologies, making it uncertain what specific discoveries they will yield in the near future.",

Understanding stellar ages is essential for determining how planets form and evolve over time. However, acquiring precise ages for individual stars is challenging due to the significant variations in mass and luminosity, as well as their complex evolutionary histories.

Moreover, while asteroseismic measurements allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the complexities of the resulting data necessitate detailed modeling for each star individually. Consequently, alternative methods must be investigated to derive ages for large samples of stars that differ significantly in terms of their properties. Gyrochronology offers an additional method for estimating ages based on the spin-down rates of magnetic activity driven by dynamo processes at the solar convective zone's base (Barnes 2003).

Introduction \nExoplanets are typically detected indirectly through the effects they have on their host stars. These effects include variations in stellar radius or luminosity caused by planets transiting across the line of sight between the star and Earth. This phenomenon is known as a transit event. To characterize exoplanets effectively, it is crucial to identify these events accurately. However, this task is complicated by the numerous false positives generated by noise sources such as instrumental artifacts and astrophysical phenomena, including eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. Consequently, multiple methods have been developed to identify transit-like features in astronomical time-series data. These include Box Least Squares (BLS), BLS+, TrES, TAP, and EXOTRANS. While each of these methods performs adequately under certain conditions, they share a common limitation: they all require substantial computational resources when searching for multiple transit candidates simultaneously. For instance, the most commonly used technique, Box Least Squares, has a time complexity of O(N³), where N is the number of data points being analyzed. As a result, many of these algorithms cannot be effectively utilized on large datasets, leading to inefficiencies. Recent studies have shown that wavelet transforms are becoming increasingly popular for analyzing astronomical time-series data.",

Introduction\nEntropy plays a crucial role across various scientific domains, including biology, geophysics, and neuroscience. It has become increasingly significant in understanding irreversibility in physical processes. Despite its importance, there has been no general method for calculating entropy production except in a few specific cases. Recently, significant progress has been made through the development of fluctuation theorems, which allow for the relationship between entropy production and measurable properties to be established. In practical applications, there has been considerable interest in creating experimental setups capable of measuring entropy production rates in real-time.

Most of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines characteristic of active star-forming regions, with stellar masses ranging from 10^10 M_sun to 10^11 M_sun. The primary aim of our project was to identify potential candidates for the progenitor populations of massive elliptical or S0 galaxies. To achieve this, we employed various selection criteria to identify galaxies with characteristics similar to those found in nearby early-type spheroids.",

Additionally, we show how this setup can facilitate entanglement generation between two trapped atoms through a shared gate operation enabled by a common coupling mechanism. Quantum information processing requires scalable solutions based on multiple qubits. One promising avenue for realizing such technologies involves using trapped atoms stored in optical lattices; however, this approach faces challenges due to limited coherence times caused by spontaneous emission. An alternative strategy involves storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped ions. Nonetheless, decoherence due to thermal noise presents significant obstacles in this approach as well. To overcome these challenges, hybrid methods have been proposed that integrate elements from both strategies. In this framework, the storage of quantum states occurs in a highly stable environment while a large number of ions can function as flying qubits. A key advantage of implementing such hybrid schemes is the potential for achieving high-fidelity operations involving both types of qubits.

One of the key questions is the nature of the elementary excitations in these novel materials. It has been suggested that these excitations could be described by collective modes, particularly spinon excitations.

We find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation describing such systems using Floquet theory and discuss their physical implications. In particular we consider an optical lattice formed by counter-propagating laser beams whose frequencies are detuned slightly from each other. This system has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally but our results provide new insights into its dynamics. Introduction:-In recent years there have been many studies on the physics of ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices  1  . These experiments typically involve trapping cold neutral atoms in a standing wave pattern created by two counterpropagating laser fields which are tuned close together so as to form a deep periodic potential  2  .\nThe resulting atomic gas forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)  3  , where all the atoms occupy the same quantum state  4  . Such systems have attracted considerable interest because they allow one to explore fundamental questions about quantum mechanics  5  -  8  while also providing a platform for studying novel phenomena  9  -  11  .

These experiments typically involve trapping neutral atoms in a standing wave pattern formed by two counter-propagating laser fields, which are closely spaced to create a deep potential well. The resulting atomic ensemble can form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where all atoms occupy the same quantum state. Such systems have garnered significant attention as they facilitate the exploration of fundamental questions in quantum mechanics while also providing a platform for investigating novel phenomena. Notably, these systems have been used to demonstrate superfluidity, Josephson effects, Bloch oscillations, Landau-Zener tunneling, and Anderson localization. However, despite previous extensive work in this area, the behavior of particles in these systems remains difficult to predict. One reason for this unpredictability is that the underlying potential is time-dependent. Since the lasers are typically operated far off-resonance, the potential's oscillations occur over timescales comparable to those of normal experimental parameters. Consequently, the energy spectrum of the system becomes quasi-continuous, leading to challenges in solving the Schrödinger equation effectively.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe challenge of understanding nonequilibrium dynamics following a global quench continues to garner significant theoretical and experimental interest. Previous studies have primarily focused on integrable many-body models described by time-independent Hamiltonians, but more recent work has begun to explore non-integrable systems. Notably, it has been demonstrated that even with a highly excited initial state, the system tends to evolve towards thermal equilibrium after a global quench. However, recent investigations suggest that thermalization does not universally occur in such systems, particularly when the initial state is coupled to an external reservoir. As a result, we anticipate equilibration only under specific conditions, for instance, if the initial state is sufficiently close to the equilibrium state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, or if the spectra of the Hamiltonians involved contain a large number of low-energy excitations.",

However, CDMA systems are subjected to significant interference among users, especially in multipath environments as the number of active users increases. To alleviate inter-user interference, various multiuser detectors have been developed. Linear multiuser detectors are particularly attractive due to their low-cost implementation. However, they do face limitations compared to more advanced multiuser detectors. To enhance their performance, nonlinear multiuser detectors, such as successive interference cancellation and parallel interference cancellation, have been introduced. These detectors leverage additional knowledge about the received signals. Consequently, blind multiuser detectors have been proposed to estimate unknown parameters without the need for training sequences. While blind detectors do not require prior information about the received signals, they typically perform worse than more sophisticated multiuser detectors. Recently, there has been increased interest in developing multiuser detectors that can effectively operate in rapidly changing channel conditions. As the channel characteristics evolve over time, accurately detecting transmitted symbols becomes increasingly challenging. Furthermore, if the channel changes too quickly, the detectors may fail to function properly. Therefore, designing resilient multiuser detectors capable of handling rapid channel fluctuations is crucial.",

In this talk I will discuss some recent results about lattice models that provide an alternative approach to studying these theories. The basic idea is to use Monte Carlo simulations to study supersymmetric field theories defined on a finite number of points (the sites) of a regular d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. These models have been studied extensively over the past few years using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and density matrix renormalization group algorithms. Recently we developed new Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the worm algorithm that allow us to simulate large systems at very high temperatures where conventional Monte Carlo methods fail because they suffer from critical slowing down.

Our findings suggest that this balance establishes a specific height for barchan dunes, aligning with observed data. The results are detailed below. We express our gratitude to Jens Egeberg Hansen from the University of Southern Denmark for his valuable insights. Sand transport occurs when particles are lifted into the air due to aerodynamic forces generated by the wind. This process is referred to as saltation, where individual particles hop across the surface before settling back down. Saltating particles interact with surrounding grains through collisions, which in turn creates turbulence. Additionally, saltation leads to both erosion and deposition. Erosion occurs when the net force acting on a grain is directed away from the dune, whereas deposition takes place when the net force acts towards the ground. These processes contribute to the formation of bedforms like ripples or dunes. Dunes arise when the sediment supply matches the rate of removal. They can form naturally, but can also be generated artificially. Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped structures whose shapes have been theoretically explained and experimentally observed. Research has shown that their width scales linearly with their length (L) according to the formula: W = 0.6L + constant, while their height (H) scales as H ∝ L^1/3.

The possibility of realizing such a repulsive force was initially proposed by Yukawa in 1951 as an approach to describe nuclear interactions without the need for fundamental particles. In recent years, several attempts have been made to measure the Casimir effect experimentally (see e.g., Refs. 1-6). However, all these experiments rely on macroscopic setups that do not allow for a detailed examination of quantum electrodynamics (QED) behavior regarding vacuum fluctuations near boundaries (Refs. 7, 8). Conversely, measuring the Casimir effect between microscopic bodies could provide insight into the properties of the vacuum (Ref. 9) and could lead to valuable tests of QED (Refs. 10-12). It is important to note that precise measurements of the Casimir force require highly refined techniques because its magnitude is often overshadowed by gravitational forces (Ref. 13). For instance, the most accurate experiment to date (Ref. 6) yields a measurement uncertainty of only 0.1%. This indicates that systematic errors are likely to have a greater impact than statistical uncertainties.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe understanding of macroscopic systems' behavior under their environment has been a fundamental topic in physics since its inception. This issue becomes particularly complex when examining many-body systems, such as those in condensed matter or quantum fields, where the number of constituent degrees of freedom can become significantly large. A robust approach for investigating the dynamics of interest involves conditioning the system’s state on measurements performed on a subset of these degrees of freedom. In recent years, several methods have emerged to efficiently describe the temporal evolution of quantum states. Among these, the Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) offers a promising alternative due to its capacity to capture non-Markovian effects. Nevertheless, despite its strengths in yielding insights for short-time evolutions, the HDM has struggled to accurately reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the state. To address this limitation, we propose a novel formulation of the HDM called the Hierarchy of Density Tensors.",

We explore how these setups can be utilized to trap and control molecular states for quantum applications. Specifically, we focus on two recent approaches developed in our laboratory: (1) Employing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in conjunction with stimulated Raman adiabatic passages (STIRAP) to generate large quantities of optically trapped molecules in desired quantum states, and (2) Utilizing cavity-enhanced photoassociation spectroscopy to investigate ultracold collisions between alkali metal atoms. Finally, we discuss potential future directions for this research field. Molecules have significant advantages over atomic systems for implementing innovative quantum technologies such as precision metrology, quantum simulations, and quantum networks. However, many molecular species are challenging to manipulate with traditional laser cooling methods due to the absence of favorable cycling transitions. To address this issue, several alternative approaches have been proposed. One promising method combines EIT and STIRAP, which has been successfully employed to create large ensembles of polar molecules. Another approach involves trapping molecules through photoassociation, leveraging the fact that the spontaneous emission rate into bound states rises sharply as temperature decreases. By coupling excited molecular states to high-finesse optical cavities, we can enhance the radiative coupling, leading to efficient trapping of molecules. This allows us to achieve densities of up to \\(10^5\\) molecules per cm³ within an optical resonator.",

Introduction\n\nSocial networks are playing an increasingly significant role in our lives, offering diverse ways to connect with one another, share information, and create opportunities. Consequently, they have attracted attention from researchers across a multitude of fields, including sociology, psychology, biology, computer science, and engineering. The rapid expansion of online platforms has resulted in an overwhelming volume of available social network data. For instance, Facebook alone boasts over one billion active users. However, analyzing such large datasets is inherently challenging due to the complex interrelationships among the nodes. To address these challenges, researchers have focused on developing effective representations for social networks. These representations aim to capture various facets of network structures while remaining scalable amidst growing data volumes. Among these approaches, matrix factorization techniques have proven particularly effective, as they allow us to represent networks using low-rank matrices. This technique decomposes a large adjacency matrix into two smaller matrices (i.e., latent factors) that encapsulate essential properties of the original graph.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nRecent advancements in trapping and manipulating ultracold atomic gases have opened new avenues for studying strongly correlated matter that is far from thermal equilibrium. Notably, experiments have shown how such systems can evolve into complex states while being driven out of equilibrium by varying external control parameters. In this study, we focus on scenarios where the system is quenched across a phase boundary. For example, if the Bose gas was initially confined in a harmonic trap, it expands freely once the confining potential is removed. Alternatively, the gas could be prepared in a specific state before undergoing a rapid change in another parameter, such as magnetic field strength. In both situations, the relaxation dynamics of the system will be significantly influenced by whether it started close to equilibrium or not. When the initial state is far from equilibrium, the dynamics may relax into a metastable state whose characteristics cannot be directly inferred from those of the original equilibrium condition.",

This suggests that dark energy significantly influences the formation of large-scale structures on very large scales. We propose that the density profiles of structures in these two scenarios exhibit distinct behaviors. These findings imply that it may be fruitful to investigate the interplay between these two scenarios by exploring cluster properties, such as their mass functions and X-ray luminosities.

These phenomena play crucial roles in regulating the growth of supermassive black holes by influencing the surrounding environment and magnetic fields.

This unification is achieved by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution function, which can be analytically solved only under specific constraints on the memory operator. We demonstrate that this challenge can be addressed by implementing a series of stochastic propagators, allowing us to derive solutions even when the memory kernel exhibits no particular functional form with respect to time or additional parameters. Finally, we explore how our findings relate to various phenomena based on fractional calculus. There has been an increasing interest in studying systems that cannot be accurately described using traditional Markovian frameworks. This interest arises from the fact that many real-world phenomena exhibit temporal behavior characterized by power-law distributions, intermittency, and other features that are typical of non-Markovian systems. To tackle these challenges, it was proposed to adapt the so-called Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism. Within this framework, one considers a system evolving over time according to deterministic laws but transitioning randomly between different states at certain intervals. These transitions can result from interactions with other dynamic entities, such as phonons, electrons, and photons.

INTRODUCTION**\nThe Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) is one of the most fundamental models of non-equilibrium phenomena. It describes the movement of particles hopping along a chain of L sites under specific exclusion rules: each site i = 1, 2, ..., L can hold at most one particle; if a site is empty, a particle hops to the right with a defined rate, while if a site is occupied, the particle remains stationary. This model has garnered significant interest due to its stationary state properties, which depend on the boundary conditions. Several studies have explored the open-boundary case, where particles enter from the leftmost site and exit from the rightmost site at specified rates. For instance, when the rates are equal (e.g., β = 1/2), the stationary state becomes independent of the initial conditions. Conversely, when the entry rate exceeds the exit rate, the stationary state exhibits phase separation, whereas a lower entry rate results in density profiles. These characteristics make the ASEP a powerful framework for studying complex systems.",

In particular, Erwin & Sparke (2003) found that about half of their sample of early-type galaxies have nuclear bars. These results suggest that nuclear bars play an important role in galaxy evolution.

On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies. Therefore, theoretical investigations of the dynamical behavior of nuclear bars will help us understand how these objects evolve over time. \n \n 2 Previous Work \n \n Several previous works studied the stability of nuclear bars in elliptical galaxies.

Introduction\nThe existence of nuclear structures has been inferred through observational studies conducted by various researchers based on photometric data (e.g., Laine et al. 2002; Erwin 2004). Notably, Erwin & Sparke (2003) found that approximately half of the early-type galaxies in their sample exhibit nuclear features. These findings imply that nuclear structures may play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies. For instance, they could provide fuel for active galactic nuclei through inflows into the central region of the host galaxy (Shlosman et al. 1990). However, only a limited number of observations directly detect nuclear features using high-resolution imaging from telescopes like HST (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005), primarily due to the technical challenges involved in resolving the compact structures located near galactic centers. Therefore, understanding the dynamical behavior of nuclear features will shed light on how these structures evolve over time.\n\n2. Previous Work\nSeveral studies have examined the stability of nuclear structures in elliptical galaxies. Athanassoula et al. (2005a) conducted simulations where they included a rigidly rotating component, representing a bulge, in a system comprising a dark matter halo and a rotating disk. They demonstrated that this disk becomes unstable when the mass ratio between the bulge and the disk exceeds a certain threshold.",

Additionally, we propose that this model can be integrated into a grand unification framework based on \\( SO(10) \\). We will also explore how our framework can address some unresolved issues related to neutrino masses and mixing. \n\nIntroduction: The Standard Model (SM), despite its many successes in explaining experimental results, faces several significant challenges, such as the gauge hierarchy problem, the strong CP problem, and the fermion mass hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, a variety of beyond-the-Standard Model theories have been proposed. Recent research has indicated that if we conceptualize the Higgs as a pNGB linked to spontaneously broken global symmetries, many of the aforementioned issues may be resolved within a single theoretical framework. This concept was originally suggested by Weinberg as a solution to the strong CP problem, but it has broader implications for other issues as well. \n\nIt is worth noting that there are established methods for constructing pNGBs. When gauging the global symmetry, we introduce vector bosons associated with the generators of the group. If the scale of the global symmetry breaking is significantly higher than the electroweak scale, these heavy vector bosons could have important implications in cosmology or astrophysics. Conversely, if the scale of the global symmetry breaking is close to the electroweak scale, these bosons would manifest around the TeV region. Such new particles could be detectable in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",

However, due to the fact that the Einstein ring radius of a lensing object is usually smaller than its angular size, it poses challenges for the precise identification of stars using ground-based telescopes. As a result, many teams have conducted intensive observations of the Galactic bulge over the past decade, leading to the discovery of over 100 exoplanet candidates. Out of these, only four planets have been confirmed through radial velocity measurements. \n\nMicrolensing events occur when two sources are aligned in the line of sight, with a foreground lensing object distorting the light from a background source. When the background source approaches the lensing object closely enough, its light is magnified. If a planet is present near the lensing object, it causes detectable perturbations in the light curve. The characteristics of these perturbations depend strongly on the projected separation between the lensing object and the planet, allowing for the possibility of detecting the planet by analyzing the resulting light curves.",

INTRODUCTION**\n\nSynchronization plays a crucial role in various fields such as biology, physics, and engineering. In recent reports, chaos synchronization has garnered significant interest due to its potential applications in secure communications, chemical processes, and guidance systems. The foundational work on chaos synchronization was conducted by Pecora and Carroll, who introduced the concept of master-slave synchronization. Since then, numerous methods have been developed, including adaptive control, active control, backstepping, and impulsive control, among others. However, most of this research has focused on scenarios where there is no delay between the slave and master systems. Recently, several studies have addressed the challenge of synchronizing chaotic systems with time delays. For instance, Wu et al. proposed a method to achieve lag synchronization between two chaotic systems with different dimensions using state feedback. Liu et al. introduced a novel delayed feedback approach to synchronize chaotic systems with unknown parameters. Wang et al. presented a method to synchronize two chaotic oscillators with time-varying delays. While these studies provide valuable insights for designing synchronized chaotic systems with time delays, they often present limitations in real-world applications.",

We find that there is no instability at zero temperature when the chemical potential lies between two consecutive energy levels of the system. This result holds true even if we consider finite temperatures as well. In particular, this implies that the ground state remains stable against collapse into a single particle state (fermionization) or formation of bound states with more than 2 particles (bosonization). The results are also valid for higher spins. Our analysis can be extended to other models such as those describing cold atoms trapped inside optical lattices.

One-dimensional ultra-cold gases serve as fascinating examples, as they provide a venue to explore many-body physics in regimes where traditional methods are inadequate. The most common experimental setup involves confining bosonic or fermionic atoms along one spatial direction within a trap, leading to the emergence of quasi-one-dimensional behavior. Recent advances have made it possible to confine these atoms sufficiently to achieve truly one-dimensional conditions. Experimental studies with Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases demonstrating confinement in narrow channels have revealed a plethora of interesting phenomena, including superfluidity, supersolids, Luttinger liquids, Tonks-Girardeau gases, and Mott insulators. Thus, possessing analytical tools to predict the properties of these novel phases would be highly beneficial. An important aspect of studying strongly correlated systems is determining whether certain states are energetically favorable. If they are, we describe those states as metastable; conversely, if they are not, the system is considered unstable. Instabilities can arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

Traditional evolutionary models often assume that new species arise through vertical transmission, meaning they pass their genetic material directly down through generations. However, there are many instances where we observe that evolution does not proceed strictly in a linear fashion; rather, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can occur between lineages, leading to what is known as reticulate evolution. For instance, when a virus infects a host, its genetic material can spread horizontally among host cells; similarly, if two plants hybridize, their offspring can inherit genetic material from both parents. In these cases, mechanisms like HGT create a more interconnected evolutionary relationship among the descendants than a strict hierarchical tree structure allows.",

        "original_text": "We present an analysis of the alignments between galaxy spins and tidal fields in real space, using data from the Two Mass Redshfit Survey (TMRS). We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their local tidal field on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is stronger for more massive galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed spin-tide correlation can be explained by the effect of gravitational torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation process of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play an important role in shaping galactic angular momenta. These findings have implications for understanding how dark matter halos acquire their angular momentum as well as for interpreting observations of cosmic shear statistics. Introduction: Galaxies form within overdense regions of the universe where they experience strong gravitational interactions with other objects such as neighboring galaxies or clusters of galaxies. During the formation process, these interactions induce gravitational torques which affect the orientation of the galactic angular momentum vector.

Our findings indicate that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their tidal fields on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is more pronounced for galaxies at higher redshifts. The observed correlation between spin and tidal influences can be explained by the torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play a significant role in determining the angular momentum of galaxies. These findings have important implications for understanding how matter halos influence their surrounding environment, as well as for interpreting weak lensing statistics.\n\nIntroduction: Galaxies tend to form in overdense regions of the universe, where they interact gravitationally with other structures, including neighboring galaxies or clusters. During their formation, these dynamics create torques that influence the orientation of the galaxy's angular momentum vector. Consequently, the orientations of these angular momenta affect the shape and dynamics of the galaxies. It has been proposed that the spin orientations of galaxies could provide insights into the properties of their surrounding structures (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008). However, observational studies have produced conflicting results regarding whether there is a systematic alignment of spin axes with respect to their surrounding structures (see, for instance, Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 for recent works). To better understand the factors influencing the alignment of galaxy spins, we investigate the statistical properties of spin distributions across large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), allow for accurate measurements of galaxy orientations, enabling us to explore these alignments more thoroughly. For instance, Lee et al. (2008) utilized SDSS DR4 data to study the relationship between galaxy spins and the properties of their nearest neighbors, finding no significant alignments.",

Lazzati \n\nAbstract: We propose that the high-energy emissions in GRB spectra may result from inverse Compton scattering between relativistic electrons accelerated in internal shocks and soft photon fields produced during the prompt phase. We argue that this model accurately predicts the spectral shapes and time evolutions of many GRBs observed by Fermi/LAT. It also offers a viable explanation for the absence of HE emissions in certain GRBs, despite their accompanying bright optical signals. Our model suggests that future observations will enable us to determine key properties of GRBs, such as their Lorentz factors or magnetic field strengths.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe Standard Model (SM), based on the gauge symmetry SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y, has successfully described various phenomena up to energy scales around the TeV range. However, there remain several outstanding questions regarding the SM, including issues related to fermion masses, neutrino oscillations, and others that cannot be fully addressed within its framework. To tackle these challenges, numerous extensions beyond the SM have been proposed. Among these, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) offer a natural resolution to some of these deficiencies. GUTs predict the existence of superheavy gauge bosons, known as GUT gauge bosons, with masses on the order of 10^16 GeV. The presence of these GUT gauge bosons gives rise to non-renormalizable operators that can break the gauge symmetries of the SM. Consequently, their contributions must cancel when summed over all states to avoid undermining the successes of the SM.",

This approach aims to estimate certain properties of the internal state of the network (e.g., the number of active flows per node or the data volume on each link) by observing only external metrics like link statistics. However, this becomes increasingly challenging in large-scale networks, as the number of potential states grows exponentially with network size. To address these challenges, various methods have been proposed that explore characteristics of the underlying network, such as sparsity, symmetry, or regularity. Nevertheless, most existing approaches either assume knowledge of the network topology or rely on structural properties that may not hold in practice, especially in dynamic or large networks. For instance, in IP-based networks, the location of routers may not always be known, and the internal connections are typically unclear. Additionally, even when some information is available, applying typical methods can be impractical due to scalability issues. Ultimately, recovering accurate traffic information poses significant challenges that require innovative solutions.",

This approach enables us to achieve high levels of anonymity while keeping the latency low for most messages. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements to our basic framework that enhance its resilience in practical applications. We evaluate our system both analytically and experimentally, demonstrating that it performs well under realistic conditions. Anonymity networks are designed to protect user identities when sending or receiving data over insecure communication channels. These networks generally consist of a series of nodes (mixes) interconnected via various communication paths. Each message entering the network undergoes multiple layers of encryption before being sent out again; this process is known as mixing. The primary goal of these networks is to prevent adversaries from linking senders and recipients of messages within the system.

Introduction\n\nSuperstring theories have been extensively studied since their proposal approximately thirty years ago. They offer not only a consistent framework for quantum gravity but also serve as phenomenological models, such as D-branes and M-theory. However, exact quantization has proven challenging due to the complexities involved in their formulation. Consequently, various approaches have been developed to create alternative formulations for superstrings. One of the most notable is the pure spinor formulation, which allows for the treatment of all degrees of freedom simultaneously without truncation. Another approach relies on the background field method. Recent work has shown that these two methods lead to equivalent results. Additionally, there exists another intriguing formulation, the pure spinor formalism. Although its application to non-linear ten-dimensional supergravity is not straightforward, it provides valuable insights regarding the structure of superstring theories.",

        "rewrite_text": "The impact of vanadium (V) vacancies on the magnetic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and magnetization pulse techniques. The results indicated that V can induce ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature, exhibiting a magnetic moment of 1.6μB per vanadium atom. This behavior is attributed to the formation of a manifest state of V, which is antiferromagnetically coupled via superexchange interactions between neighboring oxygen 2p orbitals. These findings offer significant insights into the role of ferromagnetism observed in certain transition metal oxides. Titanium dioxide has been widely utilized as a photocatalyst for various reactions under ultraviolet irradiation due to its high activity and stability. However, it typically does not display any magnetic properties since each titanium atom possesses only one unpaired electron.

        "rewrite_text": "We establish that the unstable state image function for composite fermions in the lowest Landau level corresponds to the underlying manifestation of a correlator of chiral primary fields in an N = 2 superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theory, characterized by gauge group U(1)^{Nc-1} and a matter content that includes one hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation, where Nc refers to the number of colors. We aim to discuss how this finding can be applied to compute correlation functions of specific operators at finite density using the method of supersymmetric localization. The research presented here is a collaboration with Jens Alcaraz-García, Daniel Grumiller, David H. Kaplan, Michael Lüst, and Thomas Schroer. In the realm of condensed matter physics, it has been recognized since the 1980s that electrons confined to two dimensions behave as if they are composite fermions when subjected to an external magnetic field. These composite fermions form a Fermi sea that leads to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), which manifests as quantized plateaus in their Hall conductance at fractional values of e^2/2πħ. In recent years, there have been various attempts to understand these phenomena through theoretical models, but no definitive results have emerged. One promising approach involves studying the low-energy effective theory of the FQHE. This theory features a Chern-Simons term coupled to a set of charged scalar fields, which model fluctuations around the filled lowest Landau level. Remarkably, the resulting theory is described by a two-dimensional conformal field theory. Furthermore, the partition function of this CFT on a torus aligns with the statistical sum over all states of the FQHE.",

        "original_text": "The aim of this work is to present the results obtained by applying the method of R-matrix theory for solving problems related with scattering processes on complex systems, such as atomic nuclei and molecules. The main idea behind the approach presented here consists in using an effective interaction potential which takes into account all possible interactions between particles involved in the process under consideration. This allows one to obtain solutions that are valid at any distance between interacting objects. In particular we have applied our formalism to study elastic electron-atom collisions within the framework of the Born approximation. We show how it can be used to calculate cross sections for different types of atoms (hydrogen-like ions) and compare them with those calculated within other approaches. \n \n Keywords: Elastic Scattering, Cross Section, Electron Atom Collision, R-Matrix Theory, Effective Interaction Potential, Hydrogen-Like Ions. 1 Introduction \n \n The problem of calculating cross section for elastic electron-atom collision has been studied extensively during last decades both theoretically and experimentally  1  . It was shown  2  , however, that even if the exact wave function describing the system is known, the calculation of the corresponding cross section requires very complicated numerical procedures. Therefore various approximate methods were developed  3  -  6  .

Introduction**  \nThe calculation of cross sections for elastic electron-atom collisions has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years. It has become clear that even if the scattering functions for electrons are straightforward, determining the effects of nearby interactions requires complex calculation techniques. Several approximate methods have been developed to address these complexities, including the Born approximation, second-order Born approximation, distorted-wave Born approximation, and the Kohn variational principle, among others. Although these methods provide expressions for total scattering cross sections, they often rely on specific knowledge of wave functions or potentials. For example, the application of the Born approximation necessitates knowing the exact solution to the Schrödinger equation for the initial state, while the second-order Born approximation requires knowledge of the wave function for both the initial and final states. In contrast, the distorted-wave Born approximation offers an alternative perspective.",

Additionally, we compare our findings with those published by other researchers who have investigated similar types of globular clusters. Our main conclusions are: 1. There appears to be no significant correlation among the SBPs of the three different types of globular clusters observed. 2. The SBPs of the globular clusters follow an exponential profile described by the equation: I(r) = Ie * exp(-r / rc), where rc is approximately 0.5 pc.",

Introduction**  \n\nDuring solar flares, rapid changes occur throughout the Sun's atmosphere, including temperature spikes reaching several million degrees Kelvin, intense magnetic fields, high densities, and significant velocity variations. These factors influence the shape of spectral lines emitted by various atmospheric layers. For instance, studies have demonstrated that the ratio of two Fe I lines located at different heights depends on the height of formation of each line (Feldman et al., 1995; Brosius & Phillips, 2004). The presence of nonthermal electrons results in marked deviations from Maxwellian distributions, leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al., 1990; Doschek et al., 1991), whereas bulk flows contribute to Doppler shifts in the spectral lines (Doschek et al., 1991; Brosius & Phillips, 2004; Brosius, 2009).

        "original_text": "We report on the absorption spectrum of an isolated single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) in solution, obtained by using a scanning near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and illuminated through one electrode at normal incidence to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. We observe that the TE mode is strongly suppressed compared to TM polarization due to the presence of metallic tubes within our sample. This effect can be used as a spectroscopic tool for identifying the chirality of individual SWNTs. \n \n Single-wall carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit unique electronic properties which depend sensitively on their diameter and chiral angle  1  . In particular, it has been shown theoretically  2  , experimentally  3  , and numerically  4  that the energy gap depends on these parameters such that semiconducting tubes have small gaps while metallic tubes have large ones. However, this dependence is not sufficient to uniquely identify all possible tube types  5  .\n \nIn order to determine the type of each tube individually, several experimental techniques have been developed  6  -  8  . For example, Raman scattering  9  or photoluminescence  10  measurements allow one to distinguish between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the intensity ratio of certain peaks  11  . Alternatively, electrical transport experiments  12  provide information about the charge carrier density and mobility  13  . Finally, transmission electron microscopy  14  allows one to directly visualize the structure of the tubes  15  . \n \n Here we present another method for determining the chirality of individual carbon nanotubes. Our approach relies on measuring the absorption cross section of individual SWNTs  16  . Since the absorption cross-section depends on the dielectric function  17  , which in turn varies significantly depending on whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting  18  , we expect different values for the absorption cross sections of metallic versus semiconducting tubes.

        "rewrite_text": "We present the absorption spectrum of a solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), analyzed using a northeast near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and are illuminated through one of the electrodes at an angle to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. Our observations reveal that the TE signal is significantly stronger than the TM polarization, which can be attributed to the presence of metallic tubes within our sample. This approach can serve as a spectroscopic method for determining the chirality of individual SWNTs. \n\nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes have garnered considerable attention due to their unique electronic properties that are highly sensitive to their diameter and chiral angle. Theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies have demonstrated that the energy gap of the tubes depends on these parameters, with semiconducting tubes exhibiting a smaller gap compared to metallic tubes, which have a larger diameter. However, this distinction does not uniquely identify all possible tube types. To classify each tube individually, several techniques have been developed. For example, Raman spectroscopy or photoluminescence measurements allow differentiation between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the varying intensity of emitted light. Additionally, electrical transport experiments provide insights into charge carrier density and mobility, while transmission electron microscopy permits direct visualization of the tubes' structures.\n\nIn this study, we introduce an alternative method for determining the chirality of individual carbon nanotubes by analyzing the absorption cross-sections of single SWNTs. Since the absorption cross-section is influenced by the dielectric function—which varies depending on whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting—we anticipate distinct absorption profiles for these two categories. Through careful analysis of the absorption characteristics of individual tubes, we will demonstrate how this technique can be employed to classify them into metallic or semiconducting groups. \n\nThe experimental setup details are as follows: ",
