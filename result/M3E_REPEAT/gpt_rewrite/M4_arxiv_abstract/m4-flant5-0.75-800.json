The problem of evaluating propositional Jarvis formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has been extensively studied, leading to the development of many efficient algorithms. However, most current methods struggle to evaluate large CNFs containing millions or even billions of clauses due to their high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce two novel approaches that enhance the efficiency of CNF formula evaluators: one leverages parallelization through GPUs, and the other employs data compression by representing each clause as a dynamic vector instead of a set of literals. We have integrated these innovations into our new Eisenhower package, CLEVER-CNF, which outperforms leading solvers such as SATzilla and Lingeling when tested against several benchmark datasets typically used in SAT competitions.",

Our findings indicate that CRs contribute at most 10% to the total energy budget of the universe at redshifts below 2. This upper limit aligns with previous studies concerning CRs accelerated by supernovae. Our results are also consistent with prior estimates using other data sources. These constraints can serve as priors for modeling the impact of CRs on cosmological observables like large-scale structure clustering and weak gravitational lensing. Cosmic rays, which are charged particles that uniformly fill vast regions of space, have been detected throughout our Galaxy and beyond. They play a significant role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy formation and the dynamics of the universe. However, their precise properties remain uncertain. In this study, we analyze gamma-ray data from the Fermi LAT to impose strict constraints on the role of CRs within the cosmological energy budget. Specifically, we explore two distinct models for the CR energy distribution function as a function of redshift. The first model assumes a power-law spectrum described by dN/dE ~ E^{-α} in an energy range of 10 GeV to 100 TeV. The second model utilizes a broken power-law distribution, transitioning from α1 = -2.2 to α2 = -3 at a break energy of 50 GeV. For both models, we normalize the distribution by ensuring that the total integral of the distribution across all momenta equals one. The resulting distributions of cosmic rays are illustrated in Figure 1. To assess the impact of these CR populations on the universe's expansion history, we numerically solve the coupled equations governing the evolution of the background.",

Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of the SM, offers a compelling solution to the hierarchy problem. However, SUSY models face stringent constraints from the observed properties of particle partners. To address these challenges, several authors have proposed alternative frameworks. For instance, some have suggested incorporating additional gauge symmetries, while others have explored the introduction of extra dimensions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that certain string theory models allow for the lightest superpartner to be the gravitino. The gravitino, being the mediating particle in gravity interactions, has a different decay rate compared to the neutralino. This characteristic positions the gravitino as a viable candidate for dark matter. Furthermore, if the mass of the gravitino is less than 1 GeV, its decay could occur within a timeframe compatible with current observations. Consequently, the gravitino can be considered a candidate for viable dark matter. Additionally, the gravitino's connection to gravitational interactions means it can decay into photons or lepton-neutrino pairs. If the gravitino mass exceeds 100 MeV, these decays will likely lead to detectable high-energy gamma rays. Thus, the gravitino must satisfy the following criteria:",

Generalized complex structures were initially introduced by Hitchin using Courant algebroids.

It has been demonstrated that this effect plays a crucial role in various complex phenomena, such as capillary condensation and wetting. Particularly, the Casimir effect is significant in the physics of thin liquid helium films, where it contributes to additional forces necessary for the formation of stable droplets. These effects have recently been observed in experiments on helium nanodroplets confined within magnetic traps. However, most studies to date have focused on idealized scenarios that ignore the influence of the substrate. This simplification is only valid when the thickness of the film (d) is much greater than the range of the intermolecular potential between the substrate and the surface. For cases such as helium films adsorbed on graphite substrates, typical values for these parameters are approximately: range ≈ 3 Å, and d ≈ 10 − 100 Å.

These studies rely on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over many decades in frequency space. However, because of their enormous distances, direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs are not possible. Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally. Therefore, in order to make accurate estimates of the luminosities of distant AGNs, one needs to develop models capable of reproducing the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

Much of this research focuses on observing the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs over various wavelengths. However, due to their distant nature, direct measurement of the intrinsic luminosities of most AGNs is challenging. Instead, indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between observable properties of AGNs are employed to estimate their luminosities. For example, if one can determine how the light emitted passes through a particular region within an AGN, one can reliably assess its luminosity using geometric arguments. Alternatively, by measuring the distance to an AGN, one can infer its absolute magnitude. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the geometry of the emitting regions, which is not always readily accessible through observations. As a result, to accurately estimate the luminosities of AGNs, it is essential to develop models that can reproduce the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs.",

This interplay leads to fascinating nonequilibrium behaviors. For instance, starting with flat surfaces, the introduction of quenched disorder can result in the emergence of fractal structures.

These investigations have been primarily motivated by experimental work on various types of thin films grown under controlled conditions.

Introduction\nCarbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter C-rich AGB) stars have been extensively studied in recent years because they serve as significant contributors to the interstellar medium. They produce substantial amounts of dust through their stellar winds, which are driven by the processes occurring in their surrounding envelopes and play a crucial role in the evolution of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks. However, despite numerous observational studies, the mechanisms determining the mass loss in C-rich AGB stars remain unclear. It has been proposed that factors such as total luminosity (L*), effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (g), metallicity (Z), pulsation period (P), and initial mass (M_ini) might influence this process. For instance, studies by Wood et al. (1992), van Loon et al. (1999), Olofsson et al. (2002a), Knapp & Morris (1985), and Winters et al.

This transparency allows photons to travel freely outward. As a result, the decline in cosmic density causes structures to expand more rapidly than they would otherwise, thus accelerating the expansion of the universe. We estimate this effect for various types of cosmic distributions and suggest that it could account for up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars that might be lost due to this background radiation.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS \n\nThe Standard Model (SM), based on the gauge symmetry SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y, has successfully described all observed phenomena up to TeV energy scales. However, there are several outstanding questions related to the SM, such as the origin of fermion masses and neutrino oscillations, that cannot be adequately explained within its framework. To tackle these issues, a variety of extensions to the SM have been proposed. Among them, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) offer a promising solution to these deficiencies. GUTs predict the existence of superheavy gauge bosons, referred to as GUT gauge bosons, whose masses are on the order of 10^16 GeV. These GUT gauge bosons give rise to non-renormalizable operators that can break the gauge symmetries of the SM. Consequently, their effects must not be present in any low-energy effective theory, suggesting that their contributions vanish when summed over all states. Thus, the incorporation of these non-renormalizable operators can undermine the successes of the SM.",

Generally, SMBH binaries are significantly affected by their mass ratio, especially when one black hole is considerably more massive than its companion. However, we found that if there exists a perturber with a mass ratio between 10^(-3) and 1 relative to either of the SMBHs, it can substantially influence the orbital dynamics of the SMBH binary. Specifically, in scenarios where both SMBHs have similar masses, such as those found in the centers of galaxies, the presence of an additional body can lead to significant delays in the time it takes for the binary to become observable due to gravitational wave emissions. This finding could be crucial for understanding the formation history of certain observed dual-active galactic nuclei (AGNs). \n\nKeywords: Black holes, Binary black holes, Gravitational waves",

Introduction  \n\nSynchronization plays a crucial role in various fields such as biology, physics, and engineering. In particular, chaos synchronization has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in secure communications, chemical processes, and controlled systems. The foundational work by Pecora and Carroll on master-slave synchronization initiated a wave of research in this area. Since then, numerous methods have been developed, including adaptive control, active control, backstepping, and impulsive control, among others. However, most of these studies have focused on scenarios where there is no delay between the master and slave systems. Recently, several studies have explored the challenge of synchronizing chaotic systems with time delays. For instance, Wu et al. introduced a feedback mechanism to achieve lag synchronization between chaotic systems of different dimensions. Liu et al. proposed a novel delayed feedback approach to synchronize chaotic systems with unknown parameters, while Wang et al. suggested a method to synchronize two chaotically oscillating systems with time-varying delays. Although these studies provide valuable insights for designing synchronized chaotic systems with time delays, they often face limitations that hinder practical implementation.",

A truecluster is defined as a collection of data points in a high-dimensional space that are closely spaced together while being distant from points in other clusters. We demonstrate how our method can be applied to establish correspondences between points that are captured by different sensors or at different times.\n\n**Introduction**  \nThe issue we tackle involves comparing two datasets (e.g., tracking data) to identify which pairs correspond to the same subject. This challenge often arises when analyzing multiple views of subjects, as illustrated in Figure 1. It is not always possible to achieve perfect alignment between the two sets due to calibration errors, occlusions, and other factors. In many scenarios, some prior knowledge exists regarding the correspondence between the two observations. For instance, if data were gathered using the same sensor but at different times, their respective measurements will likely have a consistent relationship. In these cases, the objective is to leverage this information to enhance the accuracy of the solution.\n\nOur approach centers on the concept of a truecluster: a grouping of data points in a high-dimensional space where members are situated close together while being separated from other clusters. In the context of matching two data sets of the same scene, each individual creates its own truecluster, as their appearance remains relatively stable over time.

This behavior can be attributed to the formation of a periodic potential arising from inter-particle correlations. Our results suggest that such structures may be observed experimentally in semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes.\n\nIntroduction: There has been considerable interest in studying the electronic properties of nanostructures. One-dimensional quantum dots (QDs) are particularly intriguing as they offer a unique opportunity to explore fundamental phenomena such as Luttinger liquids, fractional statistics, and Wigner crystallization. Theoretical studies of 1D QDs, which are confined in only one dimension while extending in the others, have revealed fascinating features related to shell effects. Subsequently, various authors have investigated different aspects of QD physics. It has been shown that the energy spectrum of a QD is highly dependent on its shape, and the properties of a QD are sensitive to the boundary conditions. Recently, significant experimental advancements have been made in realizing 1D QDs; however, most experiments have focused on transport properties rather than direct observations. This highlights the importance of establishing the fundamental principles underlying these systems. In this work, we analyze a system consisting of N non-interacting fermions confined within a 1D QD subjected to a parabolic confining potential. The total energy of the system, E_tot = ∑(i=1 to N), is computed to further our understanding of the electronic properties of these nanostructures.",

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2.

        "original_text": "We present an analytical model for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in diatomic molecules, which is based on the concept of molecular orbitals and their associated electronic wavefunctions. The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits.

The process of HHG can be described in three key steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, these electrons propagate through the continuum until they rescatter with their parent ions. Third, the electrons emit high harmonics upon recollision with the driving laser field. We derive a straightforward expression for the emitted harmonics, which depends solely on two parameters that characterize the orbital properties of the molecules. This framework allows us to interpret the observed interference patterns between different harmonics as resulting from constructive or destructive interference among contributions from various molecular orbitals. Additionally, we show how our method can predict the emission characteristics of different types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation, which involves the emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency driven by femtosecond laser pulses, has garnered significant interest in recent years. It offers insights into extreme ultraviolet light, leading to new applications such as attosecond pulse generation, photoelectron spectroscopy, and tomography. The fundamental principles behind HHG were initially explained within a semiclassical three-step model: an electron tunnels from its atomic core into the continuum due to the electric field of the laser, propagates freely, and then is driven back towards the nucleus by the same laser field. Upon recombination, the electron emits a photon whose energy corresponds to the energy gained during its journey and the energy lost while tunneling. Since then, several models have been developed, including the so-called quantum-mechanical approaches that take into account the effects of the nuclear potential on electron dynamics. However, despite the advancements made, many fundamental questions about the microscopic origins of HHG remain unresolved.",

INTRODUCTION** \n\nAccurately determining the position where a photon strikes a detector is crucial for many applications, particularly in the design of optical instruments such as telescopes. To assess the spatial resolution of a detector, it is important to have reference data against which to compare experimental results. One effective way to establish this reference point is by using a laser source that emits photons at a known angle relative to the detector's surface. If the detector lacks intrinsic spatial resolution, all photons will emerge from a defined area around the source. By rotating the detector through various angles, we can determine what fraction of the total counts is contributed by each section of the detector's surface. We refer to these fractions as the response function R(θ). Understanding the shape of the response function allows us to determine the detector's spatial resolution. However, when there is more than one pixel per angular resolution element, the complexity increases, as multiple pixels may register the same photon. To address this challenge, we propose a joint probability measure P_ij to describe the likelihood that both the i-th and j-th pixels detect a photon simultaneously. By applying this concept alongside the response function, we can better analyze the detector's performance.",

Introduction. The synthesis of light elements in the early universe remains one of the most challenging questions in modern science. It has been known since the 1940s that nuclear fusion reactions can lead to the creation of light elements such as Deuterium (D), Helium-3 (3He), Helium-4 (4He), Lithium-7 (7Li), and Beryllium-9 (9Be). However, our understanding of these processes in the early universe has evolved significantly only in recent years. In particular, the extreme temperatures (T) and densities (ρ) reached during these early phases were on the order of 10^12 K and 10^15 g/cm³. These extreme conditions are only achievable in laboratory experiments using relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, due to the short timescales involved, such experiments do not permit direct observation of the formation of light elements. Instead, they provide insights into the properties of ultra-dense matter, which may be relevant for understanding the initial conditions of supernova explosions. Conversely, the abundance patterns observed in primordial stars, such as Population II stars, or in metal-poor stars, provide constraints on models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the resulting composition of the early universe.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the amplitudes for gluons and gravitons at strong coupling using classical techniques in Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We find that these amplitudes can be derived by evaluating specific correlation functions on the boundary of the worldsheet, which correspond to tree-level gauge amplitudes through holography. The resulting calculations align with those obtained through integrability. Additionally, we establish a connection to graviton-graviton interactions, contributing to a tower of string states. These findings arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincaré transformations; instead, they correspond to corrections in supergravity induced by higher-order terms in the bulk field theory. \n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence describes how Type IIB superstrings propagate in defect-type Anti-de Sitter space (AdS) in a time-dependent manner, relating them to conformal field theories defined on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been extensively utilized to investigate non-perturbative phenomena in quantum gravity and provides a novel perspective for studying strongly-coupled gauge theories, such as QCD. In this discussion, we will examine a fundamental example of the AdS/CFT correspondence: the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (N = 4 SYM), whose dual description involves Type IIA superstrings moving in AdS5 × S5. \n\nAt weak 't Hooft coupling, λ = g²YM N [UNK] 1, where gYM represents the Yang-Mills coupling constant, perturbative calculations have demonstrated an exact match between the two descriptions. However, it remains a challenge to understand the structure of amplitudes within the gauge theory at strong coupling. Conversely, one can utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence to relate observables calculated in either framework. For example, the expectation value of Wilson loops in the gauge theory corresponds to the area of minimal surfaces embedded in AdS, while n-point correlators of local operators in the gauge theory can be realized through functional integrals over n-punctured Riemann surfaces.",

We propose a novel framework that optimizes power control, channel assignment, scheduling, and routing by formulating the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. This MILP formulation considers both intra-cell interference among users within a single cell and inter-cell interference between adjacent cells. To tackle this large-scale optimization problem, we introduce two efficient algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxation. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance performance compared to existing solutions. Specifically, when only a few users are active per cell at any given time, our approach achieves up to four times the throughput of the baseline while maintaining transmit power and bandwidth levels. \n\nKeywords: Energy efficiency, Power control, Channel assignment, Scheduling.",

We find that, for sufficiently large polydispersity index, there is no phase transition at all; instead we observe an increase of entropy as temperature decreases. For smaller values of the polydispersity index we find two different types of ordering transitions depending on whether or not particles are allowed to evaporate during cooling. In both cases we find evidence for a peak effect which can be explained within mean-field theory. The results presented here should also apply to other systems where evaporation plays a role such as colloidal suspensions. \n \n Introduction \n \n Disordered states play an important role in many physical phenomena ranging from glassy materials over granular matter to biological systems like proteins  1  . A common feature of these systems is their tendency towards ordering: At high temperatures they usually exhibit liquid-like behavior while below some critical temperature T c , they freeze into solid structures. This freezing process is accompanied by a discontinuous change of thermodynamic quantities (e.g., specific heat) signaling a first-order phase transition  2  .\n \nIn this work we consider disordered systems consisting of N interacting particles confined to a volume V . These particles may have different sizes and/or charges leading to a distribution of interaction energies between them. As a result, even if the system has only one type of particles it will behave differently than a monodisperse system  3  . If the width of the size/charge distribution becomes too large, however, the system loses its ability to form ordered phases altogether  4  . It then behaves more like a gas rather than a liquid  5  . \n \n Here we investigate how the presence of polydispersity affects the nature of the disordering transitions observed in these systems. To do so, we perform Monte Carlo simulations using a model introduced by Kob and Andersen  6  . Our main finding is that, for sufficiently large values of the polydisperisty index, there exists no phase transition at all but rather a continuous decrease of entropy upon decreasing temperature.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the disordered states in a polydisperse system using Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that for sufficiently high polydispersity, no ordered phase emerges; instead, we observe an increase in entropy as the temperature decreases. For smaller polydispersity indices, we identify two distinct types of ordering depending on whether the constituents are allowed to evaporate during the simulation. In both scenarios, we find evidence of a peak in the density of states that can be understood through mean-field theory. The results presented here should also apply to other systems where evaporation plays a crucial role, such as colloidal suspensions. \n\nIntroduction: Disordered states significantly impact various physical phenomena, including glassy behavior, granular matter, and complex biological structures like proteins. A common trait of these systems is their tendency toward ordering: at high temperatures, they typically exhibit liquid-like behavior, while below a critical temperature, they transition into ordered structures. This transition is marked by a discontinuous change in thermodynamic properties, such as density. In this study, we examine disordered systems composed of N particles within a volume V. These particles can vary in size and/or charge, leading to a range of interaction energies. Consequently, even a system with a single particle type behaves distinctly from a monodisperse system. However, if the variation in size or charge becomes too pronounced, the system loses its ability to maintain order, resembling a disordered glass rather than a liquid. We focus on how polydispersity influences the nature of disorder in these systems by employing Monte Carlo simulations based on the model by Kob and Andersen. Our key finding is that for sufficiently high levels of polydispersity, no ordered phase exists, leading to a continuous decrease in entropy with decreasing temperature. Conversely, for lower levels of polydispersity, we detect different ordering mechanisms.",

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass.

Our findings indicate that this ejection process facilitates the rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches a critical mass known as the minimum mass required for runaway accretion. Subsequently, the embryo transitions into either a gas giant planet or two planets with similar masses, depending on how close the initial conditions were to the point of instability. This behavior contrasts significantly with scenarios where all bodies evolve simultaneously; notably, we find that multiple stable outcomes can arise even with identical initial conditions. Our analysis suggests that the formation of gas giant planets likely involved several hierarchical stages of evolution prior to achieving the present configuration, as observed in nature. Furthermore, our research offers new insights into the formation of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos within circumstellar disks around young stars can experience dynamic interactions and collisions during their growth phases. If these interactions occur frequently enough, it is possible for only one body to remain by the end of the growth phase, resulting in a system with a single planet. However, our exploration reveals that many protoplanetary systems can host multiple planets, indicating that certain mechanisms may prevent the total destruction of the initial assembly. We propose a hierarchical evolutionary model in which protoplanetary embryos undergo dynamical interactions and gravitational encounters, leading to runaway accretion once the largest embryo achieves its critical mass.

Clustering techniques have been extensively studied across various fields such as data mining, bioinformatics, and computer science due to their significance in uncovering hidden patterns. However, most current methods primarily focus on identifying clusters without providing any additional insights about them. In this study, we introduce a novel graph clustering framework called CLUSTERING WITH LATTICES (CLL), which leverages specific structural characteristics to capture the patterns of each cluster. As illustrated in Figure 1, CLL transforms all input graphs into their corresponding lattices using a predefined set of rules. Subsequently, it applies hierarchical agglomerative clustering to identify groups of similar graphs. Finally, it assigns each graph to a cluster based on the majority vote among all members belonging to the same group.",

Recent interest in this model has surged due to its applications in quantum information, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. Importantly, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic system relies on the total angular momentum \\( J = N/2 \\), where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms. The Dicke model was proposed over fifty years ago, and since then, various theoretical approaches have been developed to study it. Among these, the Holstein-Primakoff transformation is a notable method that translates the original problem into a spin-1/2 framework. This transformation is effective in the weak-coupling regime when atom-atom interactions are relatively minor. However, it fails at strong coupling limits due to the emergence of non-physical states.

Our findings indicate that LSMFs arise spontaneously via an inverse cascade mechanism, which is linked to three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. However, we observed some key differences between the 2D and 3D cases. Notably, the power spectrum of LSMFs exhibits an exponential decay at large wave numbers, in contrast to the power-law behavior found in the 3D scenario. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the conservation of magnetic helicity within the context of LSMFs. Additionally, we established that the drift velocity of LSMFs is highly dependent on the initial conditions. Lastly, we explore potential applications of our results in the field of solar physics.

These applications demand materials with low thermal conductivity, high dielectric constants, minimal dielectric losses, and a high Curie temperature. BaTiO3 stands out as a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties, along with photocatalytic activity. It also exhibits good stability, biocompatibility, optical transparency, and relatively low cost. However, its sinterability poses a challenge to its applications. To address this issue, several methods have been developed, including mechanical alloying, spark plasma sintering, microwave-assisted sintering, hydrothermal synthesis, and sol-gel processing, among others.",

The RFM serves as an ultrathin medium that is accelerated to high velocities by femtosecond laser pulses directed at it at a specific angle. We observed that the interaction between the counter-propagating laser beams leads to a shift in frequencies, which are enhanced compared to those produced without the RFM. This phenomenon can be explained within the framework of nonlinear optics and classical electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential for generating high-energy photons from laser collisions in a vacuum. These discoveries have significant implications for practical applications, such as advanced imaging techniques or X-ray sources developed through tabletop experiments. In recent years, interest has grown in exploring the interactions of intense laser fields with matter under extreme conditions. One notable area of research focuses on the novel phenomena associated with high-energy laser interactions, where strong quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects come into play. For instance, experiments have observed the emission of electrons and positrons when intense laser pulses are directed at thin foils. Additionally, the generation of photons and particle pairs in vacuum has also been theoretically explored. In this letter, we report our experimental observation of another intriguing phenomenon related to the interaction of colliding laser beams in a vacuum—the relativistic tennis effect. This occurs when two counter-propagating laser beams collide within a vacuum chamber. The interaction generates frequencies that are significantly shifted towards higher energies. This effect arises from the coherent addition of the electric fields of both beams, leading to the formation of a standing wave pattern. As a result, the intensity of the standing wave increases, causing the emergence of shifted frequencies. Here, we detail the first experimental observation of the relativistic tennis effect, achieved using a relativistically flying mirror.",

However, most of these studies have been carried out in the absence of or under weak magnetic fields, where Landau quantization does not play a significant role. Conversely, it is essential to consider that Landau quantization can significantly influence various properties, such as magnetoresistance and optical absorption, especially near the Dirac point. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how Landau quantization affects the spin Hall conductivity.",

Specifically, we note that the universe exhibits several intriguing features. This research was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project DP0877481, and the views expressed are solely those of the authors.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe phenomenon of accelerated cosmic expansion has sparked renewed interest in the nature of gravity at large scales. Potential explanations for these observations may stem from alternative theories of gravity. In response to the observed acceleration, adjustments to Einstein's field equations have been proposed, incorporating forms of exotic energy. However, there is a lack of consensus among theorists regarding the nature of this exotic energy or whether it should even be considered a fundamental aspect of our universe. Furthermore, if such exotic energy does exist, it may need to exhibit behaviors reminiscent of a cosmological constant across a wide range of conditions. Additionally, it is important to investigate why a certain density of exotic energy would naturally emerge. Another possibility is that the apparent acceleration of the universe could originate from quantum effects. For instance, loop quantum gravity suggests that spacetime could experience modifications that influence cosmological dynamics. These modifications become significant as the scale factor approaches the Planck scale. Other approaches explore extra dimensions of spacetime as potential sources of cosmological energy.",

In particular, it has been demonstrated that the photon statistics of these fields are influenced by the coherence function \\( g^{(1)} \\), which describes bunched behavior at long times and antibunched behavior at short times. This characteristic arises from destructive interference among various pathways leading to photon emission. Recently, several researchers have explored the effects of spontaneous emission on second-order correlation functions, showing that spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics. However, these studies were limited to cases where the atom interacts with a single mode of light. In contrast, numerous experiments have involved atoms interacting with multiple modes of electromagnetic fields. For instance, one study examined the effects of vacuum fluctuations on the fluorescence spectrum of an atom in a three-level configuration influenced by two driving lasers, and discovered that the emission properties of the atom were strongly affected by the frequency difference between the lasers. Motivated by these findings, we investigate the second-order correlation function of an atom interacting simultaneously with two modes of light.",

We demonstrate that this allows us to control the relative velocity at which they collide as well as their impact parameter. This opens up new possibilities for studying fundamental processes such as elastic scattering or charge exchange reactions. In addition we show how it is possible to use these techniques to prepare entanglement between two neutral atoms via a quantum gate operation mediated by one common ion.

This setup opens avenues for studying fundamental interactions such as elastic scattering and charge exchange processes. Moreover, we explore how it is possible to achieve entanglement between two trapped ions via a connecting gate operation facilitated by a shared resource. The realization of quantum circuits necessitates scalable architectures based on multiple qubits. One promising approach to develop such devices involves trapped ions stored in optical lattices, but this method faces challenges due to limited coherence times resulting from spontaneous emission. As an alternative, storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped atoms has been proposed; however, decoherence caused by heating remains a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, hybrid strategies combining the strengths of both methods have been suggested. In this approach, the storage of quantum states occurs in a network of highly controllable atoms while a larger number of flying qubits are utilized. A key advantage of implementing such schemes is the potential for high-fidelity operations on both types of qubits. Recent experimental results have demonstrated that it is feasible to entangle two trapped ions through a shared interaction. However, achieving this goal requires the atoms to interact with each other prior to their release into free space.",

This upper bound can be as low as 130 GeV if we allow for nonuniversal soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The lower limit on mH,min increases rapidly with increasing tan(beta).  For small values of tan(beta) (tan(beta) < 3), the mass difference between the two CP-even Higgs bosons decreases slowly with increasing tan(beta). However, this decrease becomes more rapid when tan(beta) > 5.  In addition to these results, we also present the dependence of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson mass on tan(beta). \nI.

Therefore, one usually resorts to numerical methods  4  or approximations  5  .\nRecently, several groups have used approximate techniques  6  -  8  to calculate various properties of the MSSM Higgs sector.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) has been extensively researched over the past few decades. It includes many additional parameters beyond those of the Standard Model (SM), such as the gaugino masses \\( M_1, M_2, M_3 \\), the higgsino mass parameter \\( \\mu \\), the trilinear scalar couplings \\( A_f \\), and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan(β)). Generally, deriving analytical expressions for all physical quantities in the MSSM is challenging. As a result, one often relies on numerical methods or approximations. Recently, several studies have utilized approximate methods to investigate the properties of the MSSM Higgs sector. Notably, Reference 7 provides analytic formulas for calculating the masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM, including corrections up to first order in tan(β). They find that their approximations align well with the results obtained from more detailed calculations.",

Spintronics is one of the most dynamic fields within condensed matter physics and focuses on manipulating electron spins rather than charges to develop innovative devices like spin transistors and spin logic gates. A fundamental aspect of this field is the concept of spin current, which is defined by the flow of polarized spins through materials. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of spin currents in the dynamics of magnetic multilayers. For example, when a spin-polarized current flows through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), it can exert torque on the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer due to the spin-polarized nature of the current. If the voltage across the MTJ exceeds a certain threshold, the torque on the magnetization can exceed the damping, leading to a switch in magnetization. However, if the voltage is insufficient, the magnetization may not switch despite the presence of a spin current. To better understand how spin currents influence the switching behavior of magnetic multilayers, numerous theoretical studies have recently been conducted. Most of these studies have concentrated on the effects of external electric fields on magnetization dynamics, while comparatively little attention has been given to the direct effects of spin currents themselves on switching behaviors.",

Our findings indicate that the band gap decreases as the tube diameter increases, which aligns with tight-binding model calculations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), referred to as the HOMO-LUMO gap, is highly dependent on the tube diameter. We propose a method for calculating these properties by fitting our data to empirical functions of tube diameter, enabling predictions for the electronic structure of various carbon nanotubes within a reasonable accuracy. Finally, we discuss the impact of defects on the electronic characteristics of carbon nanotubes. Our investigation shows that both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) shift to higher energies as the tube diameter increases. Moreover, the VBM shifts more significantly than the CBM, leading to a reduction in the band gap as the tube diameter increases.

These findings can serve as guidelines for designing multilayered materials that exhibit pronounced SWR effects at low frequencies.\n\n**Keywords**: Slow-wave resonance; anisotropy; multilayer structure; dispersion relation.\n\n**1. Introduction**  \nPeriodic multilayers made up of alternating thin films from different materials have garnered significant interest in recent years due to their remarkable properties. These include high reflectivity, unusual refraction characteristics, and nonlinear optical responses, making them suitable for various applications in optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics. Recent studies have demonstrated that multilayers composed of anisotropic materials exhibit intriguing electromagnetic phenomena related to SWR. This effect occurs when the phase velocity of the Bloch waves becomes zero within the structure, which leads to a significantly increased effective refractive index (n_eff = ω / v_ph), where ω represents the frequency of the waves and v_ph is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave. Consequently, the transmission spectrum of these layered structures displays narrow stop bands, features that are highly desirable for many practical applications. Nevertheless, despite numerous investigations into SWR in multilayers, several key questions regarding the conditions that govern this phenomenon remain unanswered. For instance, experimental results indicate that even minor misalignments in the refractive indices can disrupt the SWR effect, despite other layers maintaining proper alignment.

Introduction \nNumerous studies have been conducted to explore the effects of spatial dispersion (SD), with a focus on its implications for nonlocal effects or transverse conservation laws, on various recovered phenomena such as nonlinear optical processes, spontaneous emission, and transport mechanisms. Interest in this area has been driven primarily by the understanding that many semiconductor devices operate under conditions where SD plays a crucial role. In this work, we address the dynamics of pulse transmission through a single-rectangular quantum well (QW). Our goal is to investigate how SD affects the shape of the transmitted pulse. To achieve this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with periodic boundary conditions. As will be shown, our simulations reveal that SD introduces significant features in the temporal profile of the transmitted pulse.",

        "rewrite_text": "It is important that any implementation of the Lies NOT gate be accompanied by a certain cost, which can be expressed as a universal constant multiplied by the number of qubits involved. This realization stems directly from our proof establishing a lower bound on the target-state density of specific spin systems that exhibit competing interactions and boundary conditions. Our research focuses on the potential of realizing large-scale quantum computers using novel devices such as semiconductor quantum dots or trapped ions. We also relate the implications of this work to other types of quantum implementations. The capability to perform universal unitary transformations on a set of n qubits is crucial for developing a quantum computer that can solve problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, it has been shown that no classical algorithm can efficiently simulate all quantum processes unless the complexity hierarchy collapses. Therefore, practical quantum computing requires efficient techniques for implementing only those gates whose functions cannot be computed classically. To achieve these implementations, it is essential to be able to realize fundamental operations such as single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and so forth. Notably, the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate plays a vital role, as it is foundational for constructing many important quantum operations. Unfortunately, there is currently no standard method for constructing a general CNOT gate; however, several proposals have emerged recently. These proposals typically involve coupling the states of individual atoms through magnetic fields or optical cavities. While some progress has been made in building small-scale quantum computers, scaling these systems up remains a significant challenge.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods to investigate the properties of quantum fields based on the principles of quantum optics. One such method involves the introduction of position eigenvectors, which are crucial for describing the state of a single photon. It is important to note that the use of position eigenvectors not only enhances our understanding of the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field but also enables the investigation of the temporal dynamics of photons. This opens up new avenues for analyzing various phenomena occurring during the propagation of light through dispersive materials. Moreover, the incorporation of eigenvectors into the framework of quantum fields paves the way for describing specific nonclassical effects associated with quantum processes.",

However, recent advancements have enabled the confinement of these atoms to the point where their behavior becomes effectively one-dimensional. Experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have revealed that confinement in a narrow channel results in remarkable manifestations of matter, including superfluidity, supersolids, Luttinger liquids, Tonks-Girardeau gases, and Mott insulators. Developing tools to predict the properties of these novel phases will be highly advantageous. One key question in studying strongly correlated quantum gases is whether certain states are energetically favorable. If the answer is yes, the state is considered metastable; conversely, if the answer is no, the configuration is unstable. Instabilities can arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

It refers to a critical point where several distinct phases converge simultaneously. Recently, it has garnered renewed interest due to its potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity. In particular, the (d, m) = (3, 2) Lifshitz point, characterized by spatial defects and distinct fields associated with the ordering parameters, has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, most studies have primarily focused on models with one type of ordering or purely magnetic interactions. There are comparatively few investigations into the effects of competing orders or interactions on the Lifshitz point. In this letter, we delve into the multicritical behavior of the two-finger gonihedric model with nearest-neighbor interactions on an anisotropic triangular lattice, despite the model not inherently exhibiting any ordering phenomena.

        "rewrite_text": "We present the absorption spectrum of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) in solution, utilizing a near-field optical microscope with subwavelength resolution. The SWNTs are suspended between two gold electrodes and illuminated through one electrode to excite both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. Our observations indicate that the TE polarization exhibits significantly stronger absorption compared to the TM polarization, attributed to the presence of metallic tubes in the sample. This methodology can serve as a spectroscopic tool for discerning the chirality of individual SWNTs. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are of great interest due to their unique electronic properties, which are highly sensitive to their diameter and chiral angle. Theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies have demonstrated that the energy gap varies with these parameters; specifically, semiconducting tubes possess small gaps while metallic tubes have larger gaps. However, this alone does not allow for the definitive identification of all tube types. To classify individual tubes, various techniques have been developed. For example, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence allow for distinguishing between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the ratio of emitted light in these processes. Additionally, electrical transport experiments provide insights into charge carrier density and mobility. Transmission electron microscopy offers the capability to visualize the structure of the tubes directly. In this study, we introduce another method for determining the chirality of individual carbon nanotubes, focusing on the absorption cross-sections of the SWNTs. Since the absorption cross-section is influenced by the dielectric function, which varies depending on whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting, we anticipate observable differences in the absorption characteristics of these two categories. By examining the absorption cross-sections of the tubes, we aim to illustrate how this technique can be utilized to classify them as either metallic or semiconducting. The experimental setup will be described in further detail.",

This idea has proven to be extremely valuable when applied to disordered systems, such as spin glasses and vortex lattices. In particular, it has helped to elucidate many aspects of the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin systems. Despite its successes, the original droplet picture has notable limitations: first, it fails to account for fluctuations around the critical point; second, it predicts a finite density of droplets even at absolute zero; and third, it does not adequately capture the behavior of the excitations.

In this study, we explore how HGT affects the overall fitness of unicellular organisms evolving under different environmental conditions through computational models. Our results indicate that HGT enhances fitness in cells exposed to highly fluctuating environments with frequent stressful events. Conversely, in environments with only mild fluctuations, HGT reduces overall fitness due to the accumulation of harmful mutations. Additionally, in stable environments without external stressors, HGT does not impact fitness at all.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\nIn recent studies, it has been observed that standard Wilson-type fermions face significant challenges, such as the notorious species doubling problem, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, and the Gribov ambiguity. These issues have been addressed through the introduction of alternative types of fermionic formulations. Among these alternatives, the overlap-Dirac operator is likely the most well-known, as its eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. However, the computational cost associated with the overlap operator increases rapidly with larger lattice volumes, making it expensive to compute the inverse of the Dirac operator exactly. To alleviate these computational expenses, several approximate formulations have been proposed. Notably, the Neuberger overlap operator has been regarded as a leading choice to date. Another promising approach involves leveraging concepts from exact renormalization. Research has demonstrated that the fermion determinant detD(μ), defined by the fermion matrix through the relation Sf U ≡ Tr γμ D(μ) Ux, satisfies a specific flow equation.",

        "rewrite_text": "The detailed backyard pricing model is an extension of the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that incorporates additional factors into its analysis. It includes variables such as the excess returns investors expect from holding riskier assets over lower-risk investments like Treasury bills. Another component of this model is the size factor, which captures the performance differences between small-cap and large-cap stocks. Additionally, the value factor measures the performance gap between stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios and those with low ratios; research has shown that this factor becomes particularly significant during periods of declining interest rates. This article offers an overview of these three factors, along with examples of how they can impact investment decisions.\n\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance. It posits that the expected return on any risky asset should equal the sum of the risk-free rate and a premium for the risk associated with that asset. In simpler terms, if you hold a portfolio consisting solely of risk-free securities, your expected return will be the risk-free rate. However, if you have a diversified portfolio that includes both risky and risk-free securities, your expected return will increase in line with the level of risk you accept. For example, imagine a hypothetical investor with a portfolio made up of 50% U.S. Treasury bills and 50% Standard & Poor’s 500 Index funds.

The proposed study consists of two main components: one focuses on the hydrodynamics within the gasifier, while the other examines the thermochemical processes occurring at various locations throughout the reactor. To explore how these variations might affect system stability, we conducted separate analyses of both components, as well as their interconnections. Our findings indicate that the thermochemical stability can be maintained if the oscillation period of pressure fluctuations is sufficiently long.

Subsequently, numerical simulations were conducted using realistic operating conditions to validate our theoretical results. Pressure fluctuations have been experimentally observed in various types of gasifiers, including bubbling and circulating fluidized bed gasifiers, as well as entrained flow gasifiers. These fluctuations can lead to operational challenges in the gasification process, disrupting the concentration of syngas. The primary cause of these fluctuations is the coupling between fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics.

The results indicate that both TagRank and UserTagRank significantly enhance the effectiveness of existing state-of-the-art methods. \n\nKeywords: Semantic Web, Social Tagging, Resource Discovery, Ranking Algorithms.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSocial tagging has become one of the most effective ways for users to organize and share diverse content such as articles, photos, and videos among Internet users who may have limited knowledge about how to utilize traditional search engines effectively. Users typically assign tags to describe the content they find interesting, making it easier for others to discover those resources. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing methods to leverage social tagging data for enhanced resource discovery, including recommendation systems, personalized search, question answering, text mining, event recognition, and more. However, despite these advances, research into utilizing social tagging data for automatic resource discovery remains relatively underexplored.",

Among the notable models for such fermionic systems is the Hubbard model. Despite significant progress in the last few years, precise solutions for the Hubbard model remain elusive. Recent studies have examined the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the ground-state properties of 1D Hubbard systems using a variety of techniques, including density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, exact diagonalization, Bethe ansatz, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicate that the nature of the ground state varies dramatically with the strength of spin coupling and the Coulomb repulsion parameter U. Specifically, when spin coupling is weak relative to the hopping parameter, different behaviors are observed depending on the ratio of U to t; the system is metallic for U/t < 2 and insulating for U/t > 2.",

We show that this problem can be solved by solving a linear program with O(n) variables and constraints (where n denotes the number of vertices), or equivalently by finding the maximum matching on a bipartite graph. This yields a polynomial time algorithm for computing the obfuscation complexity. As a corollary we obtain a lower bound on the obfuscation complexity for any n-vertex tree T . Finally, we prove that there are infinitely many trees whose obfuscation complexities equal their numbers of leaves. The obfuscation complexity of a graph G = (V , E ) is defined as the smallest integer k such that removing at most k edges from G makes it indistinguishable from another graph G  = (V  , E ). In other words, if an attacker has access only to the set of all possible subgraphs induced by some subset S ⊆ V × V then he cannot tell whether he is looking at G or G  unless |S| > k .\nIn this work we consider the case where G is a planar graph.

This complexity is defined as the minimum number of edges that must be removed for an adversary to be unable to distinguish between two isomorphic representations of the graph. We demonstrate that this problem can be solved through a linear programming approach with O(n) variables and constraints (where n refers to the number of vertices in the graph), or equivalently, by identifying the maximum independent set in a bipartite graph. This leads to an efficient polynomial-time algorithm for computing obfuscation complexity. As a result, we establish a lower bound for the obfuscation complexity of any n-vertex tree T. Furthermore, we show that there exist infinitely many trees whose obfuscation complexities match the number of their leaves. The obfuscation complexity of a graph \\( G = (V, E) \\) is defined as the smallest value \\( k \\) such that removing at most \\( k \\) edges makes \\( G \\) indistinguishable from another graph \\( G' = (V, E') \\).

This resulting approach has a complexity similar to that of standard Lasso but yields improved results on both simulated datasets and real-world examples, such as gene expression microarray data. Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR), developed by Frank and Friedman, operates through iterations that involve adding a variable to the current selection of features based on its contribution to the objective function.

In this study, we focus on utilizing FSR in the context of linear models with non-negative coefficients. For instance, if the objective is to identify associations with specific outcomes, it is sensible to only consider those variables that are known to increase risk rather than decrease it. A key advantage of FSR over other variable selection methods, such as stepwise regression, is that it does not require the tuning of any parameters. However, there are two significant challenges when applying FSR to datasets with a large number of potential covariates: 1) it may require many iterations before arriving at a stable solution; and 2) there is no guarantee that the selected model will include all relevant predictors. To tackle these issues, Tibshirani et al. proposed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which addresses the following optimization problem:",

These 'hot Jupiter' planets are particularly intriguing because they may be tidally locked to their stars, leading to significant day-night temperature differences on their surfaces. Moreover, their atmospheres are subject to extreme conditions due to high temperatures and intense stellar radiation. Understanding how these atmospheres behave under such extreme circumstances can offer valuable insights into atmospheric processes, both in our solar system and on other planets. In this study, we introduce the discovery and initial characterization of TrES-3b, a hot Jupiter with a period of 3.09 days, identified using the transit method. Through follow-up observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we determined that TrES-3b is sufficiently close to its host star for tidal forces to synchronize its rotation with its orbital period. However, we did not observe any significant infrared excess emission associated with the planet or its host star, suggesting that the planet may not have a substantial dusty ring system surrounding it or that its temperature is too low to produce detectable emission in the infrared spectrum beyond 4 microns.",

This research was supported by NSF grant CCF-0430018. \n\n**1 Introduction**  \nWireless networks consist of numerous nodes communicating via wireless signals. Each node has limited capability and can only interact with a certain number of other nodes directly. Instead, communication often occurs indirectly through wireless relays or routers. A critical question in this context is: How should these relays be strategically placed?",

Additionally, it was discovered that the growth rate of firm size aligns with Gibrat's Law, whereas the growth rate of profitability does not. This finding implies that the relationship between firm size and profitability can be attributed to their distinct underlying distributions. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the process generating firm size has evolved over time, just as the underlying processes influencing profitability have also changed. These results indicate that the relationship between firm size and profitability can shift over time based on their different underlying distributions.

It shows that the updated FE model could provide more accurate predictions than those obtained by the original FE model.

Among these techniques, Finite Element (FE)\nModeling plays an essential role since it provides numerical solutions to complex engineering problems  2  .\nHowever, due to uncertainties involved in material properties, boundary conditions, geometric imperfections etc., there are always discrepancies between theoretical predictions based on FE models and actual measurements  3  , especially when dealing with large scale civil infrastructures  4  .

In this context, a surface optimization method was developed to address the challenges associated with FE model updating using modal data as input. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to a cantilever beam structure subjected to static loads, demonstrating that updated FE models could offer significantly improved predictions compared to the original models. \n\nKeywords: finite element method, model updating, optimization method, modal analysis, static loadings.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nStructural Health Monitoring (SHM), also known as Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), focuses on detecting faults or deterioration in structures through various sensing techniques. Among these techniques, Finite Element (FE) modeling plays an essential role as it supports advanced engineering analysis. However, due to uncertainties in material properties, boundary conditions, and construction imperfections, discrepancies often arise between FE model predictions and actual structural responses, particularly in large civil infrastructure projects. Therefore, it is essential to update FE models to ensure they accurately reflect the dynamic behavior of real structures. Over the years, various researchers have proposed different methodologies for FE model updating. Generally, current studies emphasize two main aspects: (1) the formulation of the objective function, and (2) the optimization of parameters within feasible limits. For objective functions, some researchers utilize eigenvalues, mode shapes, and natural frequencies, either individually or in combination. In parallel, various optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization have been employed to minimize these objective functions.",

Many of these stars are believed to be part of binary or even multiple systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010).

However, there are still unresolved issues, such as the nature of dark matter, cosmic inflation, and other phenomena that cannot be sufficiently explained within the framework of standard physics. The classical theory of gravitation is predominantly described by Einstein's general relativity (GR), where the curvature tensor \\( R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\) encapsulates the geometry of spacetime. In contrast, teleparallel gravity offers an alternative approach, which is based on tetrad fields \\( A_\\mu \\) instead of the metric tensor \\( g_{\\mu\\nu} \\). The foundational equations are constructed from the connection coefficients \\( \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} \\) expressed through the vierbein fields \\( e^A_\\mu \\), with the flat metric being \\( \\eta_{AB} = \\text{diag}(-1, +1, +1, +1) \\), and the contortion tensor \\( K_{ABCD} \\).

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe equations of state play a critical role in various areas of physics, including nuclear matter, quantum gases, astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. These relationships describe how thermodynamic quantities depend on each other under specific conditions.

Introduction \nEnsembles consist of multiple base learners whose outputs are combined to produce a single prediction. They are commonly employed because they often yield greater accuracy than any individual member. Common strategies for combining predictions include voting, stacking, boosting, and averaging. However, these methods typically rely on some prior information on how to combine each classifier's output. For instance, in a three-class scenario, one might assign equal weight to all classifiers, but this could lead to suboptimal performance in cases of imbalanced data. More sophisticated techniques involve assigning different weights based on each classifier's confidence; however, determining the appropriate weights can be quite challenging. Recently, researchers have been investigating new methods to automatically generate ensembles without requiring prior knowledge. One of these methods combines genetic algorithms and bagging, both of which have been previously explored independently but are now integrated in our approach.",

We argue that these examples do not serve as counterexamples to the Jacobian conjecture, as noted by M. Laurent (see 3). Furthermore, they do not even contradict the weaker assertion made by J.-P. Serre (4), which is equivalent to the Jacobian hypothesis for curves over finite fields. Lastly, we provide a framework for constructing counterexamples to the Jacobian conjecture using our approach. Let \\( k \\) be any field with characteristic \\( \\text{char}(k) = p > 0 \\).

This implies that the Jacobians \\( \\text{Jac}(X_n) \\) have complex multiplication for all integers \\( n \\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod m \\).

This discrepancy arises from the fact that the coupling between ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2 modes is highly sensitive to the inclination angle. Additionally, we determine that the best fit model has a radius of R = 1.**, which aligns closely with the radius inferred from asteroseismology using only ℓ = 0 modes. Lastly, we discuss how this methodology could be employed to estimate the age of the star. Keywords: Seismic modeling.",

Recent investigations into this idea have garnered renewed interest, particularly in relation to string theory, which often involves the compactification of extra dimensions into lower-dimensional scenarios. However, even when one begins with a ten- or eleven-dimensional background solution, the resulting low-energy effective theory typically includes additional fields that are associated with the defects.

Such singularities pose challenges to causality unless a specific time coordinate is appropriately defined.

The parallax was measured by observing Sgr A*, which is located near the Galactic center, for two years between 2007 and 2009. We found that the distance to the Galactic center is R0 = 8 kpc ± 0.4 kpc. This value agrees well with previous measurements based on other methods such as infrared photometry or trigonometric parallaxes of masers associated with massive young stars. Our result also supports the hypothesis that the Milky Way has an axisymmetric mass distribution around its central black hole. \n \n Keywords: Distance scale, Galaxy, Parallax, Space astrometry, Black holes \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In order to understand how galaxies evolve over time, it is important to know their distances accurately. However, accurate distances are difficult to measure because they depend strongly on the assumed luminosity evolution model. For example, if we assume too high a rate of luminosity evolution, then the derived distance will be underestimated. On the other hand, if we assume too low a rate of luminosity evolu-tion, then the derived distance may be overestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the correct luminosity evolution model before deriving the distance to any galaxy. \n \n One way to solve this problem is to use radio sources whose distances can be determined independently through other means. These include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these objects, maser sources have been used most frequently since they provide very precise distance estimates. Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation.

The parallax was determined by observing Sgr A*, which is situated near the Galactic Center, over two years from 2007 to 2009. We found that the distance to the Galactic Center is R0 = 8 kpc ± 0.4 kpc. This measurement is consistent with findings from other methods, such as photometry or trigonometric parallaxes of masers associated with star-forming regions. Our results reinforce the idea that the Milky Way has an axisymmetric mass distribution centered around its supermassive black hole. \n\nKeywords: Distance measurement, Galaxy, Parallax, Space astrometry, Black holes.\n\nAccurate distance measurements are crucial for understanding how galaxies evolve over time. However, these measurements can be uncertain as they heavily rely on assumptions about luminosity. For instance, if we assume a luminosity that is too high, the calculated distance will be underestimated; conversely, if we assume it is too low, the distance will be overestimated. Therefore, it is essential to determine the correct luminosity before estimating the distance to any galaxy. One effective approach to address this issue is to identify distance indicators whose distances can be independently verified through other techniques. These indicators include pulsars, quasars, and maser sources associated with star-forming regions. Among these, maser sources are frequently used as they provide extremely precise distance measurements. Maser sources are typically found in star-forming regions where gas becomes dense and condenses into tiny ice crystals. Once these crystals grow larger than approximately one micron, they begin to emit specific radio wavelengths. The emission line widths of maser sources are much narrower compared to those of other sources, allowing for accurate distance calculations.",

We demonstrate how these factors influence the performance of the active medium at various pump intensities. To validate our findings, we compare our results against available experimental data from the literature. Additionally, we discuss the impact of temperature on the efficiency of Yb-doped materials under operational conditions close to device temperature. Lasers are among the most significant tools in modern science and industry, valued for their unique properties such as monochromaticity, directionality, and coherence. Among these, solid-state lasers (SSLs) represent a promising class of devices due to their compactness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In recent years, SSLs have found applications in diverse fields including medicine, telecommunications, metrology, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and optical data storage. However, despite their advantages over other laser types, they face several challenges, particularly at high power levels. When operating under high power or extended pumping conditions, SSLs can experience temperature rises exceeding 100 °C, which can lead to significant damage to the gain medium. This issue is especially pertinent for Yb-doped materials because Yb³⁺ has a relatively large Stokes shift due to the substantial separation between absorption and emission wavelengths. Consequently, Yb-doped lasers tend to exhibit lower efficiencies compared to Nd-doped counterparts. Furthermore, Yb³⁺ doping can result in additional losses, making Yb-doped materials more susceptible to heating and leading to reduced output powers. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms affecting the operation of Yb-doped lasers to enhance their performance.",

Introduction**  \nCataclysmic variables (CVs), often referred to as dwarf novae, are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a late-type main-sequence star filling its Roche lobe. Mass is transferred through the Lagrangian point L1 onto the surface of the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk around the compact object. This accretion process leads to outbursts caused by thermal instabilities in the disk, which result in fluctuations in luminosity over timescales ranging from hours to days. During outbursts, the accretion rate can increase dramatically, leading to strong emission and high flux in the system, while the underlying object may appear fainter due to obscuration effects. The study of CVs provides valuable information about the dynamics of accretion processes, magnetic fields, and angular momentum transport. Additionally, they can serve as distance indicators and probes of galactic structure. \n\n**2.

Besides providing critical insights into the intergalactic medium, BALQSOs offer valuable information regarding the properties of their surrounding environments through the analysis of their associated absorption lines (see, e.g., Weymann et al., 1979; Foltz et al., 1986; Turnshek & Savage 1988; Hamann 1998a, 1999). However, despite their significance as cosmological objects, understanding of BALQSOs has been limited since the identification of their first examples over 30 years ago, largely due to selection biases in optical surveys (see, for example, Hewett & Foltz 2003). Recently, several researchers have proposed that many BALQSOs could be identified among sources selected from large-area near-infrared surveys like the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) (Cutri et al.).",

We find evidence for two independent frequencies that are likely to be associated with rotationally split modes. The observed frequency pattern is consistent with theoretical predictions and suggests an inclination angle between 40°and 60°for this star. \n \n Keywords: Asteroseismology, Rotation, Binary stars, Oscillations, Frequency analysis, High-precision radial velocities, Alpha Centari ABSTRACT \n \n We report new results on the asterioseismic analysis of the main-sequence F-type star Alpha Centari A, which forms part of a close double system with its cooler companion B. Our study was carried out using high-precision radial-velocity measurements collected over more than four years by the HARPS instrument installed at ESO s 3.6-m telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chilean Andes), together with photometric observations made simultaneously with the CoRoT space mission. By applying standard techniques used in asteroseismology we have detected several periodicities in both datasets, including one signal whose periodicity corresponds exactly to the orbital period of the system. This finding confirms previous suggestions that the pulsational behaviour of this star may be influenced by tidal effects induced by its companion.

Our study utilized high-resolution radial velocity data collected over more than four years with the HARPS spectrograph at ESO's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in the Chilean Andes, accompanied by simultaneous photometric observations with the CoRoT satellite. By applying standard techniques used in asteroseismology, we identified several periodicities across both datasets, including one signal with a periodicity that corresponds precisely to the orbital period of the system. This finding corroborates previous suggestions that the pulsational characteristics of this star are influenced by tidal effects from its companion. Furthermore, our analysis reveals additional signals with periods ranging from approximately 1 day to just under 2 days. These signals are likely due to rotationally induced p-mode oscillations excited in the convective envelope of the star. Their presence provides strong evidence that the surface of Alpha Centauri A has been shaped by magnetic activity resulting from dynamo processes within the convection zone.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present a comprehensive construction of nilpotent supersymmetry transformations for both Abelian and non-Abelian 1-noble gauge fields, which are expressed in terms of chiral N = 1 superfields. The framework is largely invariant under these transformations, except for total derivatives. We find that this framework can be consistently reduced from 4-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories to 3 dimensions. Additionally, we discuss how our results can be generalized to higher dimensions. \n\n**Introduction:** Supersymmetric theories have been extensively studied over recent years due to their favorable properties such as unitarity and renormalizability. One of the most significant aspects of supersymmetric models is the existence of fermionic partners for every bosonic degree of freedom, characterized by opposite statistics. These relationships give rise to rich symmetries and enhance the supersymmetries of the models. It has been demonstrated that all fundamental interactions, including gravity, can be described within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Recent interest in supersymmetric theories has been reignited by developments in the context of moduli space and M-theory, particularly regarding their implications for brane dynamics. Moreover, many intriguing phenomena observed at high energies can be understood through the lens of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. Supersymmetry offers elegant solutions to the hierarchy problem and provides potential candidates for dark matter. The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model introduces just one additional spin-1/2 field, known as the gravitino. However, more intricate models involving multiple spin-1/2 fields also exist, including a compelling class based on extended supersymmetry. This includes N = 2 supersymmetry, which emerges in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, as well as its further generalization to N = 4. Another significant avenue of exploration is N = 1 supersymmetry in relation to D-branes and their internal structures.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS** \n\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been a subject of study for over 50 years. It models a ferromagnetic system where each spin interacts solely with its nearest neighbors via exchange interactions \\( J_{ij} \\), while also being influenced by a random external magnetic field \\( h_i \\) acting at different sites. A substantial body of research has concentrated on this problem from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. The interest in RFIM stems from its resemblance to real materials, such as diluted antiferromagnets and spin glasses. For instance, the presence of quenched randomness introduces effects similar to those seen in spin-glass systems. Moreover, the RFIM exhibits a diverse range of phase behaviors depending on the strength of the external magnetic field. At low fields, the system is paramagnetic, while at higher thresholds, the spins align magnetically, leading to a ferromagnetic phase. If the external field's strength exceeds another critical value, the magnetization transitions to a discontinuous state. These three regimes correspond to two second-order phase transitions occurring at different temperatures. Nevertheless, despite the similarities between RFIM and other systems, the precise nature of the equilibrium properties remains an open question.",

One intriguing aspect of graphene is its capability for Coulomb drag, which refers to the generation of an electric current in a second layer of electrons flowing through the first layer, even though they do not interact directly. This phenomenon occurs because both layers exchange virtual phonons through their respective substrates. Consequently, the current density in the second layer is dependent on the activity of the first layer.

We find that this results in a temperature-dependent behavior characteristic of 1/f noise, distinct in two regimes defined by a critical temperature, T*. Below T*, we observe a significant increase in the shipping signal as temperature decreases, while above T*, this signal decreases exponentially. This behavior can be explained by our model using a single adjustable parameter: the density of dangling bonds at the interface. Our results align with experimental findings on SiO2/Si systems.\n\nIntroduction: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding the origins of the prevalent 1/f noise observed across a variety of systems, from electronic devices to geological phenomena. Despite advances in understanding its microscopic characteristics, various specialized models have been proposed. Among these, the disordered semiconductor-oxide framework offers a compelling explanation for the experimentally observed universal scaling properties of A(T), such that A(T) ∝ T^(-1/2) below a certain critical temperature, T*, and decays exponentially above T*. However, a comprehensive connection between experimental observations and theoretical predictions is still lacking. In this letter, we establish such a connection by generalizing previous models to incorporate phonon-assisted tunneling between localized states near the Fermi level. Using a single free parameter, the density of dangling bonds (nD) at or near the interface, we achieve agreement with data from Si-SiO2 systems.\n\nModel Description: As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the core concept of the disordered semiconductor-oxide model posits that the primary source of...",

Since the foundational work by Pati and Salam, it has been proposed that if quarks and leptons were embedded in larger multiplets, it might be possible to understand the patterns of quark-lepton masses and mixings within the context of Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).

We find that the ordering of QDs is influenced by two competing processes: surface diffusion and the rates of quantum dot formation. Surface diffusion tends to increase the density of QDs, while the formation process leads to a reduction in density. Notably, we discover that for a certain range of QD size dispersion, there exists a critical growth rate beyond which well-ordered QD arrays cannot be achieved. This finding explains the challenges in creating large, ordered QD arrays using traditional growth methods. \n\nKeywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSemiconductor nanocrystals, commonly referred to as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional optical properties. They are utilized in a variety of optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors, and they also have important applications in biological systems. The predominant technique for fabricating QDs is the Stranski-Krastanov method, which involves depositing a thin film onto a substrate at high temperatures, followed by annealing at lower temperatures. During this process, QDs initially nucleate randomly across the sample before evolving into ordered arrays through Ostwald ripening. Nevertheless, this method does not allow for precise control over the dimensions of individual QDs. Recently developed techniques have enabled the production of highly ordered QD arrays; however, they necessitate very careful temperature control during the deposition process. \n\n2.

It predicts primordial fluctuations, which are now supported by observational data. The simplest inflationary models involve a single scalar field (the inflaton) that slowly rolls down its potential. However, recent research has demonstrated that there are more general inflationary scenarios where multiple scalar fields contribute to the total energy density driving inflation. These models open up intriguing pathways for understanding the physics behind inflation. Notably, if at least one of these scalar fields has a positive kinetic term, it leads to so-called k-inflation. Conversely, if all scalar fields have negative kinetic terms, they result in ghost inflation. Both types of inflation have been extensively studied in various contexts.

This work will enhance our understanding of dark energy by linking it with other observational data, such as Type Ia supernovae or cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Furthermore, it sheds light on the physics of inflation through the lens of primordial non-Gaussianity.\n\n**Introduction:** Inflation, a cornerstone of modern cosmology, predicts a nearly Gaussian distribution of density fluctuations. However, recent observations have indicated deviations from this prediction, suggesting the existence of primordial non-Gaussianities. Besides facilitating the large-scale structure formation, inflation has also been put forward as a mechanism for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Inflationary theories suggest that an additional scalar field beyond the inflaton should exist, which could account for the current acceleration of cosmic expansion. Quintessential inflation is a category of inflationary models where the inflaton's role during inflation transitions to that of quintessence after inflation ends. The interplay between these two fields leads to notable consequences. For instance, if quintessence has a sufficiently flat potential, it may result in eternal inflation, implying that our observable universe represents only a small part of the entire inflating phase. Another aspect worth noting is the potential decay of quintessence into radiation, which could reheat the universe.",

Our framework aligns well with current observational constraints, particularly from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and direct searches at colliders. In the following sections, we will also examine some phenomenological aspects of these scenarios.\n\nIntroduction: Inflationary theories offer some of the most convincing explanations for various phenomena associated with the standard big bang cosmology. They suggest that primordial fluctuations generated during inflation should manifest in the temperature anisotropies observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Previous work has demonstrated that supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs), such as SO(10), can provide inflationary potentials while also achieving gauge unification. However, GUT-based inflation faces challenges, particularly the so-called η-problem: the tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) is expected to be too large to match CMB observations unless certain conditions are met. This issue could be mitigated if the inflaton potential is sufficiently flat, which is commonly realized in supergravity models and may arise due to non-perturbative effects. An interesting class of flat potentials emerges when gauge groups are broken down to their maximal subgroups. These flat potentials have been extensively studied, particularly in relation to moduli fields, which characterize the size and shape of extra dimensions. Moduli fields play a crucial role in cosmology, as they influence the dynamics of the early universe and their effects on low-energy effective theories.",

This value is consistent with prior studies, but it is slightly lower than the binding energies typically predicted by other methods, which are usually higher by approximately 0.5 to 0.7 eV.

The standard fireball model (see, e.g., Rees & Meszaros 1992; Sari 1997; Piran 1999; Wijers 2001; Kumar & Zhang 2015) offers an explanation for the prompt emission of GRBs, suggesting it arises from the dissipation of energy in a relativistically expanding shell created during catastrophic events, such as the merger of compact objects. However, this model cannot explain all aspects of GRB phenomena. For example, it fails to account for the wide range of durations observed among different GRBs (e.g., Nakar 2007) and does not satisfactorily explain why only a small fraction of collapsing massive stars produce observable GRBs (e.g., Bromm & Loeb 2006). Additionally, the scarcity of optical counterparts for short-duration GRBs has led to the hypothesis that some of these events may originate from distinct mechanisms.",

INTRODUCTION Semiconductor microcavity lasers have garnered significant attention due to their potential as low-threshold laser sources. However, their multimode behavior poses challenges for numerical simulations, especially when accounting for the time-dependent dynamics of the cavity. To address these challenges, various authors have proposed different methodologies. For instance, in Reference 6, a reduced set of rate equations was introduced to describe the dynamics of the slowly varying amplitudes of the laser modes. This framework has recently been extended to include higher-order effects and nonuniform gain saturation. Another approach involves using truncated Fourier expansions, where the modes of expansion are determined self-consistently.

This curvaton decays post-inflation and generates primordial density fluctuations. We propose that the gravitational waves produced during inflation can be enhanced if the decay rate of the curvaton is sufficiently large compared to the Hubble parameter at that epoch. In this scenario, we find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio could exceed 0.1 for most parameter configurations, except in cases where the mass of the curvaton is quite heavy or the coupling between the inflaton and curvaton fields is weak. This exploration provides insights into why certain models yield a notably high tensor-to-scalar ratio. \n\nIntroduction: Current observational data strongly indicate the presence of a cosmic background of primordial gravitational waves in our universe. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for both cosmology and fundamental physics. However, the origin of these gravitational waves remains a perplexing mystery in modern cosmology. To account for the observed temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), numerous models beyond the standard tensor framework have been proposed, including supersymmetric grand unified theories and supergravity models. These theoretical frameworks suggest the existence of massive fields with masses around \\(10^{16}\\) GeV. It has been demonstrated that such heavy fields could lead to viable inflationary scenarios. Conversely, the presence of these heavy fields would typically generate an excess of gravitons unless their couplings to ordinary matter are significantly suppressed. As a result, it becomes challenging to produce substantial gravitational waves within the confines of these models without conflicting with CMB observations. Recently, however, several researchers have posited that gravitational waves could still be produced, even if the inflaton field does not couple to any heavy components. They propose a scenario in which the inflaton field interacts with another scalar field, known as the curvaton, through non-renormalizable interactions. After...",

In this model, we find that there exists a critical value \\( U_c \\), above which the ground state transitions from a metallic state to an insulating phase. This indicates a significant change in the system's properties at \\( U = U_c \\). The second model involves bosons moving along a ring with periodic boundary conditions.

        "original_text": "We present an exact solution to the classical equations of motion in two dimensions, which is interpreted as describing a rotating black hole with angular momentum J = M . The metric has the form ds2 = −dt2+(1+cosh2r)dθ2−r2dr2,\nwhere r and θ are polar coordinates on the plane. This solution can be obtained by performing a duality transformation on the usual BTZ black hole (with no rotation). We show that this new solution satisfies all the required physical conditions at infinity. In particular we find that it describes a regular black hole horizon located atr+ = √3M , where M is the mass parameter appearing in the original BTZ solution. Finally, we discuss some possible generalizations of our results. Introduction:-In recent years there have been many attempts to construct solutions to Einstein s field equations corresponding to rotating black holes  1  -  4  . One particularly interesting class of such solutions was found by Bañados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ), who showed how one could obtain a static black hole solution in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time  5  .\nThe most important feature of these solutions is their asymptotic behaviour; they describe black holes whose event horizons are completely determined by global quantities like total energy or charge  6  . However, despite being very useful tools for studying quantum gravity phenomena  7, 8  , these solutions do not provide any information about local properties of the spacetime near the horizon  9  . It would therefore seem desirable to try to extend them into more complicated geometries containing additional parameters characterizing the internal structure of the black hole  10  .\nOne way of doing so is to consider higher-dimensional extensions of the BTZ solution  11  . Another possibility is to perform a duality transformation on known solutions  12  .

An intriguing class of these solutions was discovered by Bañados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ), who illustrated how one can derive a static black hole solution in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. A key characteristic of these solutions is their asymptotic behavior, which describes black holes with event horizons determined by global symmetry, such as total angular momentum or charge. Despite their utility in studying phenomena in Einstein gravity, these solutions do not offer insights into the local properties of spacetime near the black hole’s interior. It would be beneficial to extend these solutions to more complex geometries characterized by additional parameters defining the internal structure of the black hole. One approach is to explore higher-dimensional generalizations of the BTZ solution. Alternatively, one could apply a duality transformation to known solutions. For instance, starting with the Schwarzschild solution in spherical coordinates, a suitable transformation may yield another solution expressed in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates.",

While atomistic molecular dynamics has been effective in studying phenomena over a broad range of times and length scales, coarse-grained models have emerged as valuable tools for probing longer timescales. These models typically represent groups of atoms with single interaction sites. In the context of biopolymers, such as proteins and nucleic acids, this approach allows for the retention of essential physical features while significantly reducing computational demands. Coarse-graining involves mapping individual atoms onto effective potentials, facilitating efficient exploration of configurational landscapes through techniques such as Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulations. Despite its advantages, coarse-graining can result in a loss of detailed information regarding the structures and fluctuations involved, making it challenging to accurately capture significant conformational changes. To tackle this issue, hybrid multiscale modeling frameworks have recently been developed. These frameworks combine coarse-grained representations with more detailed microscopic models to offer better insights into free energy landscapes and dynamic behavior. Another critical consideration in coarse-grained modeling is the selection of suitable interaction parameters.",

The data are consistent with theoretical predictions that such emissions should be produced by particles accelerated near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole located there.   This is the first time this phenomenon has been observed outside our own Galaxy and it opens up new opportunities for studying particle acceleration processes around black holes. Black holes are among the most exotic objects known to science. They have no surface or edge but instead exist as singularities where space-time ends. In addition they exert enormous gravitational forces so that even light cannot escape their grasp. However, despite these extreme conditions, some scientists believe that matter can still be accelerated close to the speed of light inside the so-called  event horizons  surrounding black holes.

The data align with leading predictions that such emissions are produced by particles accelerated in the vicinity of the event horizons of a supermassive black hole located in that region. This marks the first time this phenomenon has been observed outside of our own Milky Way galaxy, providing new opportunities for studying particle acceleration in the environment around black holes. Black holes represent some of the most intriguing objects in astrophysics. They lack a solid surface or definable boundary and are instead characterized as singularities where spacetime curvature becomes extreme. Their gravitational pull is so immense that not even light can escape. Nonetheless, some scientists propose that particles can still be accelerated to high energies close to the event horizon of these black holes. These powerful processes may generate photons with energies in the TeV range, which can be detected using ground-based telescopes like those of the HESS collaboration. On April 10, 2014, astronomers associated with the HESS observatory detected TeV emissions originating from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87 (M87), approximately 50 million light-years away. This was the first instance of such emissions being observed beyond the Milky Way, thereby presenting new avenues for investigating particle acceleration processes related to black holes. To comprehend how this phenomenon occurs, it is essential to explore the dynamics of matter that falls into a black hole. As illustrated in Figure 1, if one were positioned near a black hole, one would observe significant gravitational effects as they approached the Schwarzschild radius.

        "rewrite_text": "We present a project that investigates whether a circuit exists for a specific arrangement of qubits that realizes a time-independent Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian can be represented by a set of operators where each representation has at most one excited state. We analyze how to construct circuits while ensuring that all components remain stable, if such circuits can be constructed. Our approach is based on previous work that demonstrates that any time-independent Hamiltonian can be expressed as a combination of commuting projectors on its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to transform the problem of finding a realization for a general time-independent Hamiltonian into multiple instances of the same problem, albeit restricted to smaller Hilbert spaces. The reduction leads to polynomial-time solutions when tackled recursively. Additionally, we explore applications of our method in optimizing the minimum depth of circuits for universal adiabatic quantum computers. In this paper, we address the problem: Given a set of \\( n \\) qubits and \\( m \\) two-qubit gates, does there exist a circuit composed solely of these gates whose associated time-independent Hamiltonian can be realized, specifically, one that corresponds to a Hermitian operator acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? If such a circuit exists, what is the smallest possible size? The answer to this question will hinge on the specific framework used to characterize the physical system in question. For instance, in scenarios where each gate can have multiple excited states (i.e., degenerate cases), no circuit can effectively realize the given Hamiltonian unless it utilizes an infinite number of gates. Conversely, if each gate has exactly one excited state, then...",

Our results indicate that the CO state is more stable than other competing states such as ferromagnetic insulators and antiferromagnetic insulating states. \n\nKeywords: Charge ordering, density functional theory, correlated electrons, transition metal oxides, manganites, energy band structures, insulators, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism.",

These models depict particle movements dictated by stochastic rules that can satisfy detailed balance, yet exhibit intriguing macroscopic behaviors. One particular class of these models includes exclusion processes, where particles move along a lattice subject to certain constraints. Specifically, we consider a lattice comprising L sites indexed by integers 1 through L, each occupied by either zero or one particle. Particles can jump to their right or left neighboring site as long as it is unoccupied. When jumps occur independently, the resulting Markov process fulfills detailed balance with respect to a product measure.

The number of segments increases with increasing driving frequency or decreasing temperature. In addition to these two regimes, we observe another regime where the interface exhibits stick-slip motion. This third regime occurs for intermediate values of the driving amplitude A and driving frequency f .
