The infrared excess emission detected around this object suggests it may have a circumstellar disk similar to those found around young stars such as T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be stars.   In addition, there are indications that the system contains a close companion which could also contribute to the observed infrared excess emission.    We present new photometric observations obtained using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea over the period 1997-2001 covering wavelengths between 0.9-2.5 microns.  These data show significant variations in both the near-infrared fluxes and colours of the central source consistent with changes in the amount of dust surrounding the star.  This behaviour is very similar to what is seen in other pre-main-sequence systems where accretion onto the central star causes periodic increases in luminosity accompanied by increased levels of reddening due to heating of the surrounding dust grains.   Our results suggest that the current level of activity in the system is relatively low compared to previous epochs but we cannot rule out the possibility that the recent increase in brightness was caused by a short-lived burst of enhanced accretion rather than steady-state accretion occurring throughout our observing campaign.",

We explore how to renormalize this quantity through zeta function regularization. Specifically, we find that for any number of dimensions, there exists a set of counterterms that must be accounted for when calculating the manifest energy density at zero temperature. This finding has implications for Casimir effect calculations, especially in configurations where two parallel plates are separated by a distance. The presence of these counterterms can result in notable effects on the energy density. Furthermore, we examine the case of fermions coupled to scalar fields and compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. For certain values of the coupling constant, it appears that the vacuum state becomes unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Vacuum fluctuations play a crucial role in various areas of physics, including cosmology, black hole thermodynamics, and condensed matter physics. They also appear in multiple contexts within string theory. Recently, there has been considerable progress in understanding the behavior of quantum fluctuations in quantum field theories (QFTs). However, much of the existing research has primarily focused on QFTs situated in flat, time-like manifolds without boundaries. Recently, there has been renewed interest in exploring fluctuations in QFTs on curved spacetime. Another compelling area of study involves vacuum fluctuations in QFTs defined on manifolds with boundaries. These findings are essential for understanding the principles underlying Casimir effects.",

        "rewrite_text": "We introduce new distance constructions for locally decodable codes (LDCs) utilizing well-defined subsets of finite fields, the prime properties of Mersenne numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem. Our construction is an improvement on existing LDCs featuring partner query complexity derived from these specific subsets of finite fields. We further demonstrate how to combine these constructions with the Chinese remainder theorem to recover families of LDCs, whose parameters can be controlled by adjusting the primes used in their creation. Finally, we establish a lower bound on the performance of any LDC over a binary alphabet that utilizes only one-sided queries. The proofs of our key theorems are presented at the conclusion of this abstract. \n\nIntroduction: Locally decodable codes (abbreviated as LDCs) are error-correcting codes wherein each codeword is associated with a decoding view that allows for efficient retrieval of individual bits or symbols upon being queried about them. Specifically, if a codeword is subjected to up to t errors, there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that recovers the original uncorrupted message using O(t) queries per symbol. This characteristic makes such codes valuable in applications such as data storage, peer-to-peer networks, and streaming services. A significant body of research has focused on understanding the relationship between the rate of the code, its distance, and the query complexity of its decoder. For instance, works by Guruswami et al. (2005), Chan et al. (2006), and Kopparty & Saraf (2007) have explored constructing codes with low query complexity while maintaining high rates and distances. Recently, various studies have addressed the question of minimum query complexity required to decode a specific code after a certain level of corruption, including the notable breakthrough by Dvir et al. (2010), which improved upon previous upper bounds established by Sudan et al. (2005), as well as subsequent improvements by Dvir et al. (2011), Feldman et al. (2012), and Kopparty et al. (2013).",

This framework allows us to explain the observed matter density without contradicting measurements such as the relic density reported by the WMAP experiment. We anticipate that our model will yield distinctive predictions for the upcoming LHC experiments. \n\nIntroduction: The discovery of the Higgs boson has opened up numerous possibilities for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of the SM, offers a compelling solution to the hierarchy problem. However, SUSY models face significant constraints from the properties of their partner particles. In order to address these constraints, several researchers have proposed different avenues of exploration. One approach involves introducing additional gauge symmetries, while another involves incorporating extra dimensions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that there exists a class of string models in which the lightest superpartner is a gravitino. The gravitino, owing to its unique coupling to gravity, has a decay rate that is much lower compared to that of the neutralino. This characteristic makes the gravitino an intriguing candidate for dark matter. Furthermore, if the mass of the gravitino is less than 1 GeV, its lifetime becomes significantly extended, potentially positioning it as a viable candidate for dark matter. On the other hand, the gravitino is stable due to its connection to gravitational interactions, allowing it to decay into photon or lepton-neutrino pairs. If the gravitino mass exceeds 100 MeV, its decay products will predominantly manifest as diffuse gamma rays. Consequently, it is essential for the gravitino to satisfy certain conditions.",

This finding explains the challenges in achieving well-ordered QD arrays of larger sizes using conventional methods. \n\nKeywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy. \n\n1. Introduction \nSemiconductor nanocrystals, commonly known as quantum dots (QDs), also referred to as colloidal quantum dots, have garnered significant interest due to their unique optical properties. They are applicable in various optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors, and they also play important roles in biological applications. The primary method for growing QDs is the Stranski-Krastanov growth technique, which involves depositing a thin layer onto a substrate at high temperatures, followed by annealing at lower temperatures. In this process, QD nucleation occurs across the sample area, which then evolves into organized arrays through Ostwald ripening. However, this technique does not provide control over the dimensions of individual QDs within the arrays. Recently developed methods have enabled the production of highly ordered QD arrays; however, these methods require very precise temperature control during deposition. \n\n2. Model Description \nIn this analysis, we investigate the formation of QDs on a two-dimensional lattice. Our approach is based on the continuum model proposed by Tersoff et al.",

Notably, for this particular measurement, we find no evidence of Bell's theorem violations or any other indicators of nonlocality. Our setup allows us to explore contextuality by conducting two distinct experiments with identical arrangements but opposite settings. In one scenario, we observe violations of Bell inequalities, while in the other, these inequalities are satisfied. This results demonstrate that the behavior we observe can be accounted for within classical physics and highlights the concept of contextuality. \n\nQuantum mechanics posits that certain pairs of conjugate variables, such as position and momentum, cannot possess simultaneous definite values; rather, they are represented by probability distributions that evolve over time according to Schrödinger's equation. However, it has been shown that if both conjugate variables are measured at the same time, their probability distributions can interfere destructively, leading to a nil probability for observing either quantity at its most defined state. This phenomenon is closely tied to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the concept of complementarity—the notion that not all properties of a system can be observed simultaneously.\n\nIn 1964, John Bell established that hidden variable theories could not reproduce all predictions made by quantum mechanics, leading to the formulation of Bell's theorem. Since then, numerous experiments have been conducted to test whether quantum mechanics complies with Bell's theorem. These tests typically involve entangled particles, where each particle’s measurement tells about the state of the other. If the particles are far enough apart such that their measurements occur independently, the observed correlations may reflect local or classical effects.",

Our findings indicate that the presence of these additional magnetic influences has significant implications for the dynamics and structure of the discs. Specifically, we observe that an initial magnetic field can reduce the mass accumulation within the disc over time by inhibiting fragmentation near the central protostar. This results in more robust discs compared to those predicted by purely hydrodynamic simulations. Initially, the resulting discs are more flared due to the magnetic support provided. However, as time goes on, the magnetic field depletes through ohmic dissipation and turbulence driven by instabilities.

We believe this approach can also be applied effectively at high Reynolds numbers, even though some underlying assumptions may not hold true. A key advantage of our method over standard Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques is that it does not require the incorporation of subgrid models, simplifying the process by eliminating the need for tuning parameters commonly found in other LES frameworks. Additionally, we show how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with implicit LES based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to enhance computational efficiency. We further discuss some challenges related to the practical application of these methods.\n\nTurbulence plays a significant role in numerous phenomena, ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and environmental processes. However, despite extensive research, turbulence remains one of the most complex problems in fluid dynamics. One reason for this complexity is the vast range of scales that exist within turbulent flows. While large eddies dominate much of the kinetic energy, they occupy only a small fraction of the total volume. Conversely, smaller eddies occupy nearly the entire volume but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. As a result, accurately capturing all scales of motion necessitates computational grids that can become prohibitively large. To address this challenge, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have been developed over the past few decades. These methods focus on resolving only the large-scale features of the flow responsible for the majority of the kinetic energy while modeling the effects of unresolved smaller-scale fluctuations. Although LES has proven effective in many engineering applications, it is not without its limitations, particularly regarding the variability of subgrid-scale models. Recently, variations of LES-like methods have emerged that aim to improve upon these challenges.",

Finally, we observe an extended feature to the east of the nucleus that appears to be a tidal structure. This research was supported by CONACyT grant 36586-E. We express our gratitude to J. M.

We find that these perturbations can be divided into two components: one related to the underlying geometry and the other intrinsic to the perturbation itself. Notably, we demonstrate that for any stationary solution of the equations, there exists a corresponding alteration in the conservation of various quantities. This indicates that conservation laws are not invariant under certain perturbations. Additionally, we illustrate how these variations may affect the validity of the weak equivalence principle. We also discuss the broader implications of our findings for cosmology and black hole physics. General relativity (GR), which describes gravitational interactions at large scales, has been thoroughly tested against observations over many years. However, it remains uncertain whether GR holds true at smaller scales where quantum mechanics becomes significant. To tackle this question, various alternative theories have been proposed, including scalar-tensor theories and modified gravity frameworks. These alternatives often include modifications that extend beyond the predictions of GR. For instance, in scalar-tensor theories, the graviton acquires mass through its interaction with a scalar field. Similarly, in modified (R)-gravity theories, the standard Einstein-Hilbert action is updated to incorporate curvature corrections. It turns out that both types of theories allow for self-accelerating solutions, such as de Sitter-like scenarios, without requiring specific conditions.\n",

Our results indicate that all these ZGNRs exhibit half-metallic characteristics, with the exception of H-ZGNR, which behaves as a metal. The band gap of F-ZGNR and N-ZGNR is increased compared to that of pristine ZGNR, attributed to the electronegativity interactions between the carbon atoms at the edges and their surroundings. In contrast, when oxygen substitutes one or two carbon atoms at each edge, the band gap decreases slightly due to charge transfer from the oxygen to the adjacent carbon atom(s).

A particularly intriguing scenario is the seesaw mechanism, wherein SM singlet right-handed neutrinos acquire large Majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking. To ascertain whether the observed neutrinos are genuinely Majorana particles, it is essential to search for lepton number violating processes mediated by virtual heavy neutrinos. These include neutrinoless double beta decay, tritium beta decay experiments, and charged-current quasielastic interactions. However, each of these processes faces significant astrophysical and/or nuclear uncertainties. In contrast, collider experiments offer a clean environment to investigate lepton number violation. For instance, the search for same-sign dileptons and trileptons at hadronic colliders has led to stringent limits on the existence of Majorana neutrinos. Another promising channel for study is the production of doubly charged scalars, which can occur through s-channel exchanges of gauge bosons or t-channel exchanges of heavy fermions.",

        "rewrite_text": "The stopping power of uranium had been studied at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) using a thick target method and a detector positioned downstream of the target. The results were compared to calculations based on the TRIM code, which is widely utilized by nuclear physicists investigating heavy ions. A good agreement between the experimental data and calculations has been observed for most of the ranges studied. However, discrepancies were noted near the end of the range, where the experimental data indicated greater stopping power than predicted by the TRIM calculations. This suggests that TRIM may underestimate the contribution of electronic excitation to the overall stopping power. The findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of uranium as it traverses through matter and may serve as input parameters for models that simulate the transport of uranium ions in various materials. Stopping powers were experimentally determined for uranium across a variety of thin targets, including carbon, aluminum, gold, silver, lead, copper, iron, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, ytterbium, and uranium itself. These measurements were conducted at NSCL’s Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility using the thick-target method and a detector placed downstream of the target. Results are presented alongside comparisons with predictions from the TRIM simulation program.",

The DGC consists of multiple proteins, including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, and utrophin. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin result in the loss of this protein from the sarcolemma, leading to significant muscle degeneration. However, research has indicated that the expression of utrophin can compensate for the absence of dystrophin by interacting with other components of the DGC, such as alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG). This study examined the interactions of beta-dystroglycan and its ability to bind to utrophin or its related protein, dp116, using primary mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) and mdx mice, which lack functional dystrophin. It was found that beta-dystroglycan was processed into two distinct forms in both MSCs and mdx sciatic nerves. One form had a molecular weight similar to that found in normal mouse tissue, while the other exhibited reduced mobility compared to the normal form. Both variants were capable of interacting with utrophin, but only the lower molecular weight form could bind to dp116. These findings suggest that modifications to beta-dystroglycan may influence its interactions with utrophin and/or dp116.",

However, we believe that advanced telescopes equipped with sensitive instruments like phased-array feeds or advanced backends could facilitate such observations in the future. Furthermore, we examine alternative methods that utilize pulsar timing data to study gravitational effects on satellites in their orbits. Gravitational waves can cause variations in the timing of pulses received at different locations on the surface of a rotating neutron star. These variations depend on the distance between the pulsars as well as their orientation relative to the observer. The most significant effects are observed when a pulsar is positioned close to the Earth and its accompanying bodies, resulting in a time delay known as the Shapiro effect (Shapiro, 1964). By analyzing the pulsar timing data from all pulsars within a globular cluster, we can infer the distances between them.

We observed that the activation of vibrational modes significantly alters the effective coupling between the surface and adsorbates, which leads to a breakdown of the collinearity of the states involved in the dissociation process as the surface temperature increases. This phenomenon is particularly evident during the real-time observation of atomic desorption from the surface. Additionally, we noted a marked change in the desorption coefficient in relation to the temperature of the adsorbed species: at high energies (above 500 meV), where the molecule-surface interaction time becomes comparable to or even shorter than typical vibrational periods, the desorption coefficient increases relative to lower energy ranges.",

The existence of these particles would lead to violations of causality. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental tests for our proposal.

        "rewrite_text": "We focus on the relationship established by relativistic fluctuation theorems, which elucidate the connection between entropy production in non-equilibrium systems and fluctuations in equilibrium states. We demonstrate that these relationships can be derived solely from standard statistical mechanics, relying on time-reversal symmetry. Specifically, we derive an expression for the rate of entropy production in terms of correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. This framework is applied to analyze entropy production in various models, including Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, and driven harmonic oscillators. Furthermore, we explore how our approach could extend beyond classical physics. Relativistic fluctuation theorems link entropy production during non-equilibrium processes with fluctuations in equilibrium states. These relationships have been established by applying standard statistical mechanics principles while maintaining time-reversal invariance. Here, we utilize this formalism to derive expressions for entropy production rates and recovered currents in terms of correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. As specific applications, we investigate several models, including Brownian motion, Langevin processes, and driven harmonic oscillators.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEntropy plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, including biology, geophysics, and neuroscience. Its significance has grown in discussions related to irreversibility. However, a comprehensive method for calculating entropy production has been elusive, except in a few specific cases. Recently, fluctuation theorems have emerged, enabling the connection between entropy production and measurable properties of systems. In particular, there has been substantial interest in developing experimental techniques capable of measuring entropy production rates in real-time scenarios. Such experiments facilitate direct tests of fundamental thermodynamic principles and may lead to practical devices for harnessing work from physical systems.\n\n2. Classical fluctuation theorems\n\nThe most renowned fluctuation theorem was first proposed by Jarzynski.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present a study of the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for stars located at various latitudes and distances from the Galactic center, utilizing spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis reveals that the MDFs are consistent with one another within their uncertainties, except for those at |b| > 30°, where there is a noticeable excess of metal-poor stars compared to the inner population. The proportion of metal-rich stars increases as one moves closer to the Galactic center. This suggests that the halo metallicity becomes more enriched as one moves inward from the Galactic outskirts. Additionally, we also observed that the average metallicities decrease slightly with increasing distance from the Galactic center. These findings imply that the outer regions of our Galaxy have been shaped by processes related to accretion. \n\nKeywords: Metallicity Distribution Function; Halo; Disk; High Latitude Stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIt is well established that the Milky Way is composed of three primary components: the thin disk, the thick disk, and the halo. However, the exact ways in which these components formed and evolved remain a topic of research. Understanding their respective chemical compositions is critical, as they reflect different evolutionary histories. For example, the age-metallicity relationship indicates that the halo formed earlier than the disk (e.g., Twarog 1980), while elemental ratios like Fe/H suggest the halo hosts many low-mass stars, which would have been destroyed by supernovae if the halo had formed relatively recently, as in the case of the disk (e.g., Nissen & Schuster 1997). Numerous studies have investigated the properties of the halo using samples of stars primarily selected based on proper motion or photometric parallax. Recently, extensive spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000), the RAVE survey (Steinmetz 2003), and the SEGUE survey (Yanny et al. 2009) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the halo's composition.",

We found that the fraction of binaries within these clusters decreases as they evolve, primarily due to dynamical interactions between single stars and binary star systems. This reduction is more significant when there is a higher initial number of recovered binaries or a scarcity of soft binaries. Moreover, we explored how the properties of binaries depend on their binding energy at formation. Finally, we compare our findings with observations of real star clusters and globular clusters. Our main conclusions are: 1) Open clusters tend to have more binaries than globular clusters because they retain them longer during dynamical evolution; 2) Binaries can be disrupted by three-body encounters, even while the overall number of binaries remains constant; and 3) Hard binaries prevail over soft binaries after several relaxation timescales (t_ rh).",

Our simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism can achieve higher throughput compared to existing schemes while also ensuring fairness among competing stations. \n\nKeywords: Wireless Local Area Networks, Packet Inter-Arrival Time, Fairness, Throughput Improvement.\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of portable computing devices such as laptops, PDAs, and smartphones, there has been an increasing demand for high-quality services in wireless local area networks (WLANs). However, due to the limited resources available in WLANs, efficient resource management has become critically important. Currently, the most widely used access control protocol in WLANs is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which employs a contention-based channel access method using Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and provides contention-free service via Point Coordination Function (PCF). While CSMA/CA allows multiple devices to share the same channel simultaneously without explicit coordination, it struggles to maintain performance when the number of active devices increases. This issue is largely attributed to the hidden node problem, wherein two devices attempt to transmit packets to each other simultaneously, resulting in collisions. To mitigate this problem, several solutions have been proposed. Notably, one approach introduced a channel reservation method aimed at reducing collisions between packets transmitted by different stations. However, all these studies fall short of addressing the implications of the number of active stations on performance.",

        "rewrite_text": "The authors present their research on the interactions between two protons and one neutron, which is referred to as the triton channel in nuclear physics. They utilized data from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to investigate this phenomenon at low energies (below 100 MeV), taking advantage of findings from other researchers. The results are compared with experimental data collected over several years by various research teams studying this interaction. The agreement between their predictions and experimental outcomes is found to be within acceptable uncertainties. This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231. Recently, there has been significant interest in nuclear physics regarding the interactions among three particles—protons and neutrons—and how these interactions impact the properties of nuclei such as helium-3 and carbon-12. These processes can occur when high-energy photons from the Sun strike the Earth’s atmosphere; however, it is also plausible that these interactions contribute to the formation of heavy elements during stellar nucleosynthesis. For example, scientists have proposed that helium-4 could be synthesized through the interaction of helium-3 and neutrons. Before we can fully understand the processes that occur inside stars like our Sun, we need to gain deeper insights into the fundamental interactions among these particles. To aid in this understanding, physicists at MIT employed lattice QCD, a method traditionally used in high-energy physics experiments but carried out on computer simulations, to predict the behavior of nuclear reactions. Specifically, they investigated the reaction p + p + n → d + d + n, where 'p' denotes proton, 'n' denotes neutron, and 'd' represents deuteron. Their calculations were based on…",

The study reveals significant differences in the magnetic field profiles observed by the satellites. Specifically, data from GEOS-1 indicates a pronounced peak near L = 3, whereas information from ATS-6 and GEOS-2 suggests a peak around L = 4. These discrepancies may arise because the satellites sample different regions of the ionosphere due to their varying orbits. Furthermore, it is noted that the magnetic field profiles inferred from the three satellites are consistently shifted when extensively examined along the L-shell. This finding indicates that the observed variations in the field profiles are likely linked to spatial differences rather than temporal changes.",

Silver is commonly used as a coating in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), while silicon dioxide is frequently employed as a substrate or insulator in MEMS devices. Our results are relevant not only to these specific cases but also extend to any system consisting of two plates separated by vacuum, which can include a variety of structures such as semiconductor heterostructures, quantum dots, and nanowires, all of which have gained significant attention due to their potential applications in nanotechnology.

        "rewrite_text": "We present an extraordinary optical transient (OT) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). The OT exhibited a magnitude of R = 16.7 and reached R = 14.6 within approximately one day. It is situated near the core of M85, one of the closest galaxies to our Milky Way. We found that this event shares several characteristics with Type Ia supernovae but lacks the typical spectral features associated with these phenomena. This suggests that we may be observing a different type of explosion that could be related to various other transient events, such as tidal disruption flares or superluminous supernovae. \n\n**Keywords:** Supernova, Optical transient, PTF, Tidal disruption flare, Brightest cluster\n\n**Introduction:** Recently, there has been an increase in reported cases of luminous optical transients associated with nearby galaxies. Notable examples include the well-known eruptions of Eta Carinae (Davidson & Humphreys 1997; Smith et al. 1998), SN 2005ap (Gal-Yam et al. 2005; Foley et al. 2007), ASASSN-14li (Holoien et al. 2014a), ATLAS14aaq (Dong et al. 2015), PS1-10jh (Gezari et al. 2012), iPTF16axa (Kasliwal et al. 2016), and ASASSN-15oi (Shappee et al. 2016). Many of these events have been linked to supermassive black holes within active galactic nuclei. However, their precise nature remains debated. Some researchers have proposed that they may be the result of tidal disruptions of stars by black holes (TDE) (Komossa 2002; Gezari et al. 2009; Bloom et al. 2011; Holoien et al. 2013b; Arcavi et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2017), while others contend that they could represent the explosion dynamics of thermonuclear outbursts (similar to SNe Ia) (Valenti et al. 2009).",

        "rewrite_text": "In this study, we investigate the interactions between carriers in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for two interacting electrons or holes within an anisotropic QD potential. We discover that the behavior of the system varies significantly depending on the initial state, resulting in three distinct regimes: the weak coupling regime, characterized by the absence of dark states; the strong coupling regime, where one electron is excited into higher energy states while the other remains in its ground state; and the mixed regime, where both electrons oscillate simultaneously at slightly different frequencies. Furthermore, we examine how these regimes are influenced by the parameters of the QD, such as its size and shape. Our findings also have practical implications, including the generation of entangled photon pairs through biexciton processes. Quantum dots have been the focus of extensive research over the past decade due to their remarkable optical properties. A key advantage of QDs is the ability to tune their emission characteristics by varying their size, allowing them to function across a broad range of wavelengths. In this work, we concentrate on the impact of carrier-carrier interactions within semiconductor QDs, utilizing a numerical approach to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equations. When carriers are in close proximity, they engage in strong interactions that can lead to the formation of bound excitonic complexes. However, if the interactions are weak, they may experience Coulomb attraction leading to the formation of virtual excitons. These virtual excitons can either recombine radiatively or non-radiatively, potentially leading to Auger processes. Conversely, during situations such as the pumping of photoexcited carriers or in the presence of external electric fields, the interactions can become sufficiently strong to be treated perturbatively.",

We propose that this framework can be enhanced by considering not just individual metabolites, but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as fundamental elements for calculating entropy. This approach allows us to define what we call pathway entropies, which help quantify the uncertainty associated with different components of the metabolic network. The proposed method enables researchers to pinpoint areas within the network where uncertainty is most pronounced. Additionally, we present a novel visualization technique for metabolic networks that leverages these new entropy-based measures. We validate our approach by applying it to two examples sourced from the biochemistry literature.\n\nMetabolic networks are crucial in various biological processes, including cell growth and metabolism. They consist of a complex web of transforming biochemical reactions, such as the conversion of substrates into energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through glycolysis. The study of metabolic networks has gained significant attention due to their potential as drug targets and their ability to offer valuable insights into cellular dynamics. For instance, identifying key enzymes involved in specific pathways can aid in the development of therapeutics against certain conditions. Moreover, metabolic networks have been shown to exhibit properties similar to those found in social networks, hinting at underlying common principles among different types of networks.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the functionality of metabolic networks, several computational models have been developed. Stoichiometric approaches, for example, seek to mathematically describe all possible states of a given metabolic network. However, the high dimensionality of these models makes it challenging to analyze large metabolic networks effectively.

The explosion is driven by the release of gravitational energy as the collapsed core rebounds after reaching nuclear densities. Additionally, we discovered that the presence of a strong toroidal magnetic field can create asymmetries in the ejecta. These asymmetries may be responsible for the polarization signals observed in some SNe Ia. \n\n**Keywords**: Type Ia Supernovae, Rotation, Magnetic Fields, White Dwarf Stars, Accretion-Induced Collapse\n\n**1. Introduction**  \nRecent observations have revealed that many Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) exhibit significant linear polarization. This has been interpreted as evidence of asymmetric explosions, which may be triggered by strong magnetic fields or rapid rotation. However, it remains unclear whether either factor alone can account for such highly polarized light curves. In this study, we investigate how the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields influences the outcome of accretion-induced collapse (AIC), wherein a white dwarf collapses into a neutron star. To conduct this investigation, we employ two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations utilizing the FLASH code. Our initial models consist of rigidly rotating white dwarfs with masses ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 solar masses. To incorporate the effects of general relativity on the dynamics of the white dwarf, we apply the polytropic equation of state \\( P = K\\rho^\\Gamma \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the mass density and \\( P \\) is the pressure. The main objective of this research is to determine whether AIC events triggered by rapid rotation and/or strong magnetic fields can produce the high levels of polarization observed in SNe Ia.",

Our findings reveal that microtubules exhibit remarkable stiffness against bending, yet they are relatively flexible when it comes to stretching. The elastic behavior can be effectively described by an entropic spring model with a persistence length of approximately 1.5 micrometers. Microtubules can be reshaped into configurations such as rings or helices without experiencing permanent deformation. Furthermore, when we examine their bending behavior, we observed that the degree of bending depends on the imposed force. This suggests that microtubules possess internal structures that develop during polymerization. These insights enhance our understanding of microtubule behavior within cells, where they are subjected to both external forces and internal tensions from interacting proteins. Microtubules (MTs) are crucial in various cellular functions, including cell division, intracellular transport, and mechanosensing. They are composed of tubulin dimers arranged head-to-tail into protofilaments. MTs originate from centrosomes and exhibit dynamic instability, transitioning stochastically between periods of growth and shrinkage. Additionally, microtubules interact strongly with motor proteins. For example, kinesin-1 moves processively along microtubules, whereas dyneins exert pulling forces. These motors generate forces that can cause microtubules to buckle and deform. Previous studies have suggested that such deformations could lead to mechanical instabilities and even catastrophic failures. However, there has been limited research on the mechanics of individual microtubules under strain. In this letter, we employ optical tweezers to analyze the elastic properties of Jarvis microtubules. Our results indicate that microtubules are quite stiff against bending but exhibit softness when stretched.

This approach extends the traditional geodesic framework to account for corrections stemming from perturbative effects. Our findings reveal that both spherical and non-circular orbits possess two distinct families, each characterized by different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family exhibits lower orbital frequencies compared to the outer one; the inner solution describes bound orbits while the outer solution describes unbound ones. For circular orbits, we show how these behaviors can be derived from the established laws of black hole mechanics. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) shifts inward as the spin parameter increases. Finally, we explore the implications of our results for astrophysical phenomena, such as accretion disks surrounding rotating black holes.\n\nIn the introduction, we note that the discovery of the binary pulsar PSR1913 + 16, along with accurate measurements of the mass ratio between its neutron star components and their companion white dwarf, led to the conclusion that most binary systems ultimately evolve into black holes characterized by surrounding accretion disks. Since then, numerous observations have supported this model. Understanding the dynamics of matter falling into black holes necessitates knowledge of where it becomes trapped or ejected. This understanding is crucial for identifying the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which marks the closest possible radius where matter can stably orbit a black hole. The position of the ISCO is highly sensitive to the black hole's spin parameter \\( J = Ma^2 / (2r_g) \\). Specifically, if \\( J < M^2 \\), then the ISCO radius is greater than \\( 3M \\). However, as \\( J \\) approaches \\( M^2 \\), the ISCO radius decreases sharply, ultimately reaching the Schwarzschild radius \\( R_s \\equiv 2GM / c^2 \\).

Furthermore, the transition between these regimes is marked by a hysteresis effect. This phenomenon can be understood in the context of a model developed for the semiconductor-metal transition induced by strong non-equilibrium heating.

This behavior can be understood by examining the balance between corotation torques and Lindblad torques. Furthermore, we have discovered that mass accretion onto planets depends on their orbital distance due to the gradient created across the gap opened by the planet.

        "rewrite_text": "We introduce the first examination of the infrared extinction law (IRAL) in a cloud core, L183. The IRAL is determined by comparing near-infrared observations to mid-infrared data collected from the same line of sight through the cloud. Our analysis reveals that the IRAL exhibits no significant variation with depth into the cloud, even at an extinction value of AV = 1000 mag. This suggests that dust grains are not entirely destroyed, even under the extreme conditions found deep within dense clouds. We propose that growth processes may be limited in these environments due to efficient fragmentation resulting from collisions among large grains. These findings have significant implications for understanding the formation processes of planetesimals. \n\n**Keywords**: Infrared extinction law, dust properties, interstellar medium, shock waves. \n\n1. **Introduction**  \nIt has been suggested that interstellar dust grains can grow to millimeter sizes or larger within dense molecular clouds because they can survive against destructive collisions with other grains (e.g., coagulation processes; Ossenkopf & Henning, 1994). However, other studies have indicated that there are many regions in dense environments where the dust density exceeds 10^6 cm^{-3} (unpublished data, Stepnik et al., 2003; Pagani et al., 2003), which contradicts this scenario. To address this discrepancy, it has been proposed that larger grains could be destroyed through collisional fragmentation as they reach sizes comparable to the mean free path of hydrogen (Ormel et al., 2007). Another possibility is that dust grains do not simply disappear, but instead break into smaller fragments during collisions (e.g., Blum & Wurm, 2008). If this is the case, we would expect to observe evidence of ongoing fragmentation, such as sub-micron-sized particles in dense regions. In fact, several observational studies have reported the presence of sub-millimeter emission features attributed to silicate and/or carbonaceous dust in such dense environments (e.g., Jones et al., 1993; Chiar et al., 1998; Kessler et al., 2000).",

This article is part of a series on Quantum Matter.

One particularly intriguing class of models involves so-called WIMPZILLAs, which are stable relics with masses around \\(10^9\\) GeV. These particles could have formed thermally in the early universe, and their presence could still be detected through their annihilation. In this letter, we propose an alternative explanation for the nature of dark matter, suggesting that it consists of self-gravitating bosons. Boson stars are gravitationally bound states of scalar fields, with several candidates arising from various extensions of the Standard Model. Initially studied in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories, where they serve as solitonic objects, boson stars have more recently been examined in the context of quantum field theory. If these objects do exist, they would contribute to a population of compact structures that could account for all or part of the observed dark matter.",

Our analysis reveals a significant excess of ELG-AGN pairs at specific separations compared to random distributions. The proportion of AGNs among all ELGs increases with lower luminosity. Interestingly, there seems to be no marked difference in the AGN fractions found within various types of ELGs. This indicates that some ELGs may host hidden AGNs. This research was funded by NASA grant NNX10AD65G, and we appreciate the helpful feedback from the Jurassic referee. Previous studies have shown that many active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly those with low luminosity or obscured by toroidal structures, display strong emission line characteristics (see, for example, Ho et al. (1997) and Hao et al. (2005)). These AGNs often appear similar to partners in compact groups when observed through optical spectroscopy, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al.

To identify these paused objects, we employed two criteria based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs): 1) they must exhibit both emission lines (ELGs; see Section 2.1 below) and absorption features (Section 2.2) simultaneously; and 2) they should not be classified as quasars according to the BPT criteria (Baldwin et al. 1981, Kewley et al. 2001).

        "rewrite_text": "We present a framework for understanding why quantum mechanics displays nonlocal characteristics, highlighting the challenge of reliably predicting whether a measurement will be obtained in any given experiment. We explore how this can result in superluminal connections between two parties that are significantly entangled, utilizing only classical communication and local operations (LOCC). We then expand the Born rule to accommodate this framework, moving beyond the traditional von Neumann formalism. The proposed formulation of quantum mechanics presumes that all experiments occur under ideal conditions, where no errors arise during state preparation or execution. However, in reality, there are always some imperfections, such as decoherence from environmental interaction, imprecise state setups, and measurement inaccuracies. To address these influences, various methods have been proposed, including stochastic Schrödinger equations, quantum fox approaches, and probabilistic frameworks. Here, we introduce another perspective known as Quantum Bayesianism. In this approach, the wave function is interpreted as encapsulating our knowledge about the system, rather than merely reflecting its intrinsic properties. This means that when a measurement is taken, the outcome is informed by an update of our knowledge in accordance with Bayes' theorem. For instance, if Alice measures the spin of her particle along the x-axis, she updates her beliefs based on the outcome. If Bob subsequently measures his particle’s spin along the same axis but arrives at a different result, his understanding of the system must also be adjusted accordingly.",

This low efficiency arises because most particles are scattered back upstream before they acquire enough energy to cross the shock front again. Consequently, the limited efficiency of UHE acceleration imposes an upper limit on the energy of protons, which can reach only a fraction of the total cosmic ray luminosity produced by such shocks. Our findings suggest that the observed fluxes of UHE protons cannot be solely accounted for by diffusive shock acceleration theories related to cosmological shocks.

This study takes into account the influence of Majorana mass terms on the neutrino fields. We find that the DM can be classified as either fermionic or bosonic, depending on the parameters in question. Notably, if the UED scale is near 1 TeV, the DM candidate could be a scalar field, which has recently been proposed as an explanation for the PAMELA positron excess observed at high energies. Our findings are presented in the context of LHC physics, particularly in relation to phenomena beyond the Standard Model.\n\nIntroduction: The discovery of a Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), alongside other compelling evidence, has confirmed the existence of a fundamental scalar particle responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. However, many questions remain about the nature of this scalar sector, including its spin, whether it is CP-even or CP-odd, its couplings to gauge bosons and fermions, and the potential existence of additional scalar particles in nature. These questions are expected to be addressed as new data becomes available from ongoing experiments such as ATLAS and CMS. \n\nOne of the most intriguing avenues of exploration involves considering the potential limitations of the Standard Model (SM). This includes extending the SM into extra dimensions, which introduces Kaluza-Klein excitations for all matter fields. Previous studies have investigated the phenomenology of these Kaluza-Klein modes in depth. Notably, it has been demonstrated that the lightest Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton could serve as a candidate for cold dark matter (CDM). This connection is significant, considering that CDM comprises approximately 23% of the energy content in our universe. Furthermore, the presence of these extra dimensions may influence the production of Kaluza-Klein states through various decay and annihilation processes. Recent work has pointed out additional implications of these findings.",

        "rewrite_text": "The electronic and transport properties of ripples in layer-stacked graphene are studied using tight-binding models informed by first-principles hopping parameters based on density functional theory (DFT). The analysis reveals that the presence of ripples can induce a bandgap at the Dirac point in both armchair and zigzag orientations. Furthermore, it is observed that electron mobility decreases as the amplitude of the ripples increases, due to the rise in scattering centers created by the ripple structures. These findings are significant for understanding the underlying mechanisms behind experimental observations related to the effects of rippling on the electronic performance of graphene devices. Graphene possesses impressive electronic properties due to its unique two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, which contributes to various novel phenomena such as high carrier mobility, Klein tunneling, and valley polarization. Nevertheless, experimental studies have demonstrated that pristine monolayer graphene tends to develop ripples spontaneously. It was first suggested that these ripples could impact the efficiency of graphene-based devices. In this study, we analyze how these ripples affect the electronic and transport properties through a tight-binding approach. We find that the ripple-induced strains can lead to a bandgap formation near the Fermi level in both armchair and zigzag configurations. Additionally, electron mobility is found to decrease as the amplitude of the ripples increases due to the introduction of additional scattering centers.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the production of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclei at large Bjorken x and low Q², using data collected by the HERMES experiment between 1997 and 2002. The analysis is conducted within the framework of collinear factorization and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al. We find that the observed enhancement of hadron yields in deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects without needing to invoke additional phenomena such as sea quark contributions or gluon saturation. Furthermore, we observe a significant increase in the production of strange quarks, which cannot be accounted for by conventional partonic models but may indicate the presence of intrinsic strangeness in the proton’s parton distribution function. \n\n1. Introduction  \nSemi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (SIDIS) has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. This process provides insights into the quark structure of the target nucleus through the analysis of hadron states in conjunction with the scattered lepton. At high Bjorken x, where the active quarks are highly virtual, SIDIS probes the critical region that bridges the non-perturbative regime described by effective field theories and the perturbative regime governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this kinematic domain, it becomes possible to study the properties of bound-state hadrons through their interactions with virtual photons, thereby offering insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of composite states. Theoretical studies have shown that the distributions for SIDIS significantly depend on the transverse momentum k_T of the detected hadrons. It was observed that the dependence of cross sections on k_T can discriminate between different theoretical approaches. Generally, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism predict a strong increase in cross sections with increasing k_T, while those using the CCFM evolution equations yield different predictions. \n\n2.

The presence of these attractor states has significant implications for the evolution of our universe.

Our derivation employs a mapping between the ASEP and the totally asymmetric zero-range process (TAZRP), which can be solved exactly using the image product ansatz. The resulting formulas are expressed solely in terms of elementary functions, providing closed-form expressions for flux that have previously only been investigated numerically. Notably, our findings replicate known results for scenarios where particles can enter and exit at both ends of the system with equal rates. Additionally, we offer insights for cases where particles enter and exit at either end of the system with unequal rates. \n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is one of the fundamental models of non-equilibrium phenomena. It describes particles hopping along a lattice of L sites under specific rules: each site i (where i = 1, …, L) can hold at most one particle; if there is no particle at site i, then a particle can hop rightward with a given rate; if a particle occupies site i, it remains stationary. This model has generated substantial interest due to the intriguing properties of its stationary state, which depend on the chosen boundary conditions. Past studies have examined the behavior of the system under open boundary conditions, where particles enter from the leftmost site at a rate α and exit from the rightmost site at a rate β. For example, when α = β = 1/2, the stationary state becomes independent of the initial conditions. Conversely, when α > β, the stationary state exhibits phase separation, while the opposite scenario leads to density profiles. These characteristics render the ASEP a powerful tool for analyzing non-equilibrium systems.",

This suggests that CMIs can be excited more readily than previously assumed under certain conditions. We also conducted numerical investigations into the influence of solitary waves on the growth rates.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nIn our research, it was observed that the conventional Wilson-type fermions encounter significant issues such as the chiral species doubling problem, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, and the Gribov ambiguity. These challenges have been addressed through the introduction of various fermionic formulations. Among these innovations, the overlap-Dirac operator is particularly notable, as its eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. However, its computational cost escalates rapidly as lattice volumes increase, since the inverse of the Dirac operator must be computed exactly. To mitigate these costs, several approximate methods have been proposed. Notably, the Neuberger overlap operator has emerged as a preferred option. Additionally, a promising approach involves exact renormalization techniques. It has been demonstrated that the fermion determinant detD(μ), with D(μ) representing the fermion matrix defined through the fermionic action S_f U ≡ [UNK] Tr γμD(μ) Ux, adheres to a specific flow equation.",

These sources are produced via second-harmonic generation (SHG) within an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO utilizes periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) as the nonlinear medium and a concave mirror for cavity feedback. Our experimental results show that this setup enables us to achieve high-quality interference between photons from degenerate pairs across the entire acceptance bandwidth of the PPLN. This approach has the potential to simplify experimental procedures in continuous-variable entanglement over a broad range. The ability to create and manipulate entangled states of light is crucial for advanced quantum applications. In particular, Bell state measurements play a vital role in various applications, including quantum teleportation and quantum repeaters. However, producing these highly nonclassical states can be challenging, as it typically involves indistinguishable photon pairs that cannot be generated in a deterministic manner. In recent years, several strategies have emerged to address this issue. One approach relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), where a nonlinear interaction generates correlated pairs of signal and idler photons. By carefully adjusting the characteristics of the light fields, it has become possible to produce any superposition of the four Bell states. Another line of exploration focuses on utilizing particular states or squeezed states instead of coherent laser sources. While these methods enable efficient creation of entangled states, they often suffer from low fidelity due to experimental imperfections.",

        "rewrite_text": "The increase in mass of stars is driven by star formation, which occurs when available gas collapses into new stars. The rate of this process depends on the amount of gas that is available for collapse. This availability is influenced by the balance between gas inflow from larger scales and outflow from smaller scales. This discussion will explore research conducted through numerical simulations to understand these dynamics. It will also highlight the role magnetic fields play during star formation. Star formation happens when dense clouds of gas collapse under their own gravity, leading to the creation of protostars. These protostars continue to form through the process of accretion until they reach the main sequence stage, where nuclear fusion begins. During this formation, energy is released as outflows and radiation, which heats the surrounding gas and drives powerful jets and winds. Therefore, understanding the factors that control the rate of star formation requires insight into how gas flows toward forming stars. Gas can accumulate and form stars either directly or indirectly through filaments. Direct flows can be channeled along magnetic field lines, while indirect flows can be carried along turbulent gas motions. Both types of flows have been observed in the vicinity of forming stars, but it is still debated whether one type predominates over the other. Recent studies suggest that both direct and indirect flows play significant roles, depending on the specific environment. Observations indicate that most low-mass stars tend to accrete gas effectively.",

Instead, information about the initial conditions of the collision process must be inferred indirectly from final-state measurements  4  .

In this article, we focus on the scenario where two electrons with opposite spins occupy different orbitals around the same nucleus. We demonstrate how to calculate these states using only polynomial-time algorithms on classical computers. This approach is based on recent advancements in computational complexity, including concepts such as the PCP theorem (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs) and the testability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The results presented here have implications not only in quantum physics but also in computer science, providing valuable insights into the challenges posed by NP-complete problems. Quantum mechanics plays a critical role in contemporary physics, with one of its defining characteristics being that particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously, as illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Another key aspect is entanglement, which leads to correlations between particles that cannot be explained through classical means. In this work, we address the following problem: given a system consisting of N spin-1/2 particles, what is the overall state of the system? Specifically, if all of them were in a superposition at once, what would be the resulting state? We will concentrate on the simplest non-trivial case: two spin-1/2 particles occupying different orbitals around the nucleus. Notably, we find that solving this problem is closely related to determining the ground state of a variety of quantum systems.",

Our findings indicate that these systems exhibit behavior that aligns with fluctuations in conductance, similar to those seen in non-interacting electrons or in scenarios where the dephasing time is not saturated. The nature of these fluctuations is influenced by both temperature and system size. This work can serve as a foundation for studying phonons in quantum dots.\n\nIntroduction: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in transport phenomena through mesoscopic structures such as semiconductor nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. These materials exhibit remarkable properties due to their nanoscale dimensions, typically on the order of 10 nanometers. For instance, they are capable of displaying ballistic and coherent transport regimes. Notably, experimental studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of conductance fluctuations in these materials are strongly dependent on temperature (T) and system size (L). These fluctuations decline rapidly with increasing temperature and decreasing size. At low temperatures, conductance fluctuations are primarily due to interference effects. However, at higher temperatures, thermal averaging disrupts coherence among different pathways, leading to a reduction in conductance fluctuations that decreases exponentially with temperature.",

The correlation function is computed for each sample by counting pairs as a function of angular separation.

This observation can be attributed to the fact that more luminous galaxies tend to reside in dense environments compared to their less luminous counterparts.

SGRs are known for their repeated bursts of high-energy gamma rays, while AXPs are characterized by persistent X-ray emissions with detectable pulsations. Magnetar candidates display similar features to AXPs but do not exhibit clear periodic signals. All three categories of sources occasionally release significant flares alongside associated phenomena.

Our findings indicate that the observed full density of lenses is consistent with predictions based on current dark matter simulations. However, it is inconsistent at over 3 sigma confidence if we assume a standard thermal relic WDM model with mass mX = 1 keV. This suggests either that the current WDM models need revision or that there are other effects not accounted for in our analysis. The detailed text can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604070v1.pdf. The existence of dark matter has been established beyond reasonable doubt through its gravitational influence on visible matter. However, despite extensive research, little is known about this enigmatic component of the universe. Notably, it remains uncertain whether dark matter consists of a single particle species, as most models suggest, or multiple different types. One possibility is that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), such as neutralinos predicted by various supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. To explore these scenarios observationally, astronomers have been searching for evidence of dark matter in a variety of astrophysical contexts, including galaxy clusters and quasars. A particularly promising method for these searches involves examining gravitationally lensed sources, where light from distant objects is bent by the gravity of intervening dark matter halos. If dark matter consists of WIMPs, their masses are expected to range between 10 GeV/c² and 100 TeV/c². For instance, the recently discovered cluster Abell 2218 may contain a halo composed entirely of WIMPs.",

We will also discuss the relationship between the zeta functions of certain families of tori and their associated modular forms.

The GMOR is detected by analyzing the transmission spectrum through the cell while it is perturbed with respect to the axis of circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that this phenomenon can be understood using classical electrodynamics, and we provide experimental results that illustrate the dependence of the GMOR signal on various parameters, such as the detuning and polarization angle of the incident laser light. This work enhances the understanding of quantum optics phenomena at the atomic level in a confined environment. In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing systems for trapping atoms or confining them within microscopic volumes. Such techniques offer multiple advantages over traditional atomic experiments, including reduced interaction times between trapped atoms and external fields, improved spatial resolution, and minimized Doppler broadening. These attributes are crucial when considering applications that require high precision. Additionally, confining matter to nanoscale dimensions opens new avenues for exploring fundamental physics. For instance, the production of Bose-Einstein condensates necessitates trapping large numbers of atoms in tight spaces. Similarly, studies of the properties of individual atoms can lead to insights by isolating them from other sources of decoherence. Furthermore, the demonstration of macroscopic quantum effects relies on the capacity to manipulate matter at a quantum level. In this context, we describe our progress toward achieving controlled states of neutral matter in confined dimensions. In particular, we have developed a method to create a thin film of cesium within a glass micro-cell.

Additionally, upper limits are established on the mass difference between the lightest CP-even Higgs boson and its CP-even or CP-odd partners. These findings enhance previous analyses carried out by the ATLAS collaboration. This work has been summarized in presentations aimed at aiding readers who wish to replicate our analysis or apply it to other datasets.

Nonetheless, several crucial questions remain regarding the properties of this newly discovered state, including whether it is part of a larger multiplet. In the framework of supersymmetry, each particle in the SM has a superpartner that differs only in spin. If R-parity is conserved, all superpartners must be produced in pairs. One implication of this scenario is the existence of multiple Higgs doublets. Specifically, if the scalar Higgs boson observed at the LHC corresponds to the lightest CP-eigenstate h₀, then the heavier CP-eigenstates H₀ and A₀ could couple strongly to fermions. Such scenarios could substantially enhance the branching ratios for the decays of these states into detectable photons. To investigate possible deviations from the SM predictions, precise measurements of the masses and couplings of the Higgs bosons are essential.",

In this study, we conducted large-scale transport simulations on GNRFETs by solving the nonequilibrium Green's function equations within a rigorous mass transport framework. We found that the subthreshold swing decreases rapidly when the channel length is shorter than 10 nm, while it increases slowly for lengths greater than 20 nm.

In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2.

We find that, despite the branching fractions being affected due to helicity suppression, these processes serve as valuable probes for physics beyond the Standard Model through their CP asymmetries. \n\nIn this paper, we focus on two specific types of charmless hadronic decays: \\( B \\to SV \\) (where \\( S = P, A_0 \\) and \\( V = T_1 \\)) and \\( B \\to SV \\) (where \\( S = P \\) and \\( V = A_1 \\)). The first type is characterized by one spectator quark in the final state, while the second has no spectator quarks. In both cases, there is only one spectator quark contributing to the helicity state of the decay. Despite this, these decays can still provide significant insights into physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly through comparisons of their CP-violating asymmetries with those of other decay modes. Theoretically, these decays have been investigated using various approaches, including naive factorization, perturbative QCD, soft-collinear effective theory, and QCD factorization. Different theoretical predictions have varied significantly. For example, using naive factorization, one study found \\( \\text{Br}(B^- \\to K^* 0 \\pi^-) / \\text{Br}(B^- \\to K \\pi) = 0.27 \\pm 0.04 \\), while other references suggested a range around \\( 0.1 - 0.2 \\).

For certain parameter ranges, it may be possible to produce gluinos or squarks through Drell-Yan processes.

Our findings show that, for an interferometer utilizing an SRM, there is no inherent limit on its sensitivity at high frequencies due to quantum noise fluctuations. The shot-noise limited sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing the circulating power within the cavity formed by the two mirrors. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increasing radiation pressure noise associated with the mirror's movement. Furthermore, we realize that the sensitivity of these detectors significantly depends on whether the input mirror is suspended. Finally, we discuss how these insights can be applied to improve the design of advanced LIGO-like detectors.

Recent semi-classical analyses have demonstrated that the shot noise limited performance of these detectors cannot be improved beyond a certain point without introducing additional technical noise sources. It has also been proposed that one solution to mitigate this issue is to incorporate an additional mirror, a signal recycling mirror (SRM), into the optical setup of the interferometer.

In this study, we present a lattice Boltzmann model that is capable of handling high Reynolds number flows with high compressibility by employing multiple relaxation times (MRT). The MRT-LBM solves the discrete velocity model (DVM), where each distribution function represents the behavior of macroscopic fluid properties at different velocities. We utilize the D2Q9 DVM to address two-dimensional incompressible flow. To validate our proposed method, we conduct several benchmark tests including lid-driven cavity flow, Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, Taylor vortex flow, and flow through a channel. Our results show a strong agreement between the outcomes produced by the MRT-LBM and those reported in the existing literature.",

To tackle this problem, we employ concepts from stochastic geometry, which allows us to model the locations of both mobile users and interferers as point sources. Our findings are summarized as follows: First, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability as the number of active users increases indefinitely. These expressions help us assess how many users can reliably transmit simultaneously over the channel.

Through numerical simulations for various values of the spin temperature \\( T_S \\), we find that the 21-cm PS exhibits a distinct peak that corresponds to the shapes of individual H II regions.

The planet orbiting HD 196885A is an inflated gas giant with a mass of approximately 0.88 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 4.3 days, positioned at a remarkably close distance of only 0.04 AU from its star. We found no evidence of additional companions to either host star down to masses as low as 5 Jupiter masses within separations of 10 AU. Both planets exhibit orbital eccentricities consistent with being close to zero. These findings suggest that \"hot Jupiters\" can survive close encounters with other stars during their formation or evolution. Hot Jupiters are gas giants situated very close to their parent stars, and while they are among the most extreme types of planets found in our solar system, they appear to be common around nearby Sun-like stars. Studies, such as those by Santos, indicate that about 20% of Sun-like stars may host such planets. However, these planets are thought to migrate inward from several AU, likely influenced by interactions with the protoplanetary disk and/or perturbations from other bodies. This raises questions about how these planets avoid being ejected into interstellar space after experiencing strong dynamical interactions with others while still remaining in their current close orbits. In this letter, we report on the investigation of the two Jupiter-like planets using precise radial velocity measurements taken over more than eight years with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), located at the 3.6-meter telescope of the European Southern Observatory at La Silla Observatory in Chile.

The author posits that these hypothetical dark matter particles can be conceptualized as celestial mechanics entities with unique properties. Notably, the discussion highlights how such entities could potentially account for some of the observations recently reported by the DAMA experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. It is important to note that this explanation does not conflict with any established experimental data. However, there are significant challenges associated with the proposed theory that will be further explored. This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation under grant No. 14-50-00040. For further details, you can access the article at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5189.\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant mysteries in modern physics. Its presence has only been inferred indirectly through its effects on gravitational phenomena such as galactic formations, galaxy clusters, and others, while direct detection experiments have thus far been unsuccessful. Numerous models of cold dark matter (CDM) exist, yet only a few have undergone experimental verification. One theory suggests that dark matter consists of elementary particles. These particles could potentially interact weakly or electromagnetically with ordinary matter, allowing them to escape detection even if they are present in large quantities. Conversely, if they interact strongly with normal matter, they could be detectable. Various experiments searching for dark matter interactions have been conducted. Recently, observations by the DAMA collaboration have garnered considerable attention due to reported annual modulation effects thought to be caused by Earth’s orbit around the Sun, leading to an increased rate of nuclear recoils detected from June through October compared to December through February. Such behavior cannot be explained within the standard model of particle physics, prompting various authors to propose alternative explanations.",

These observables include the number of muons per meter squared (N_m), the ratio of muons to electrons at 1000 meters above sea level (f_1000), and the logarithmic mass (ln(A)). We compare these measurements for different zenith angles and energy levels. For protons, as the zenith angle increases, f_1000 rises while N_m decreases. This trend can be explained by the fact that heavier primary particles interact higher in the atmosphere, leading to the production of more muons relative to electrons when compared to lighter primaries. At lower energies, there is a notable excess of events characterized by low values of N_m and high values of f_1000, suggesting a contribution from heavier primary particles such as helium or nitrogen.",

In this context, we propose utilizing graphene as a suitable candidate by leveraging its unique electronic properties. We outline how this can lead to a novel type of spin transistor that operates at room temperature without the need for external magnetic fields or complex gate voltages. The proposed device consists of two ferromagnetic contacts connected through a graphene channel. By applying a voltage between these contacts, we can manipulate the SOC in the graphene, influencing the transmission of spin current through it. This results in spin behavior reminiscent of traditional transistors. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that this device achieves high on/off ratios even under realistic operating conditions. We also discuss potential experimental implementations of this device. Graphene stands out as a promising material for spintronic applications due to its remarkable properties. It enables the development of devices that rely on pure spin currents, which can avoid limitations posed by Joule heating. In particular, the spin Hall effect allows for effective generation and manipulation of spin currents using solely electric fields. Despite numerous theoretical proposals, there have been limited experimental demonstrations of graphene-based spintronic devices.

Based on this data, we derive an estimate of the effective thermal inertia, I = 100 ± 50 J m^-2 s^-1/2 K^-1, which aligns well with measurements obtained by other researchers using various techniques. Our findings are consistent with laboratory experiments conducted at high temperatures, which show that thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. By analyzing the thermal inertias, we investigate the Yarkovsky effect acting on NEAs. Our calculations suggest that this effect may play a significant role in driving certain NEAs into orbits that cross the Earth's path, with important implications for the capability of space missions to deflect potential asteroid threats. Near-Earth Asteroids pose a risk to civilization due to their potential to impact Earth within a million years. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to develop strategies capable of deflecting or redirecting NEAs before they’re on a collision course with Earth. One potential method involves applying a torque to change an NEA's trajectory through the Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effect. However, the success of this approach hinges on our ability to accurately predict the dynamics of the YORP effect.",

This enables us to reconstruct the four-dimensional geometry of spacetime without assuming any specific model or parametrization. To demonstrate our technique, we apply it to simulated data generated using the publicly available CAMB software.

Our work establishes that this framework exhibits both classical correlations, which align with hidden variable theories, and quantum correlations that cannot be explained by such models. Our findings demonstrate the capability of this setup to simultaneously manifest all three types of Bell inequalities. The original Einstein-Bohr photon box, initially referred to as the EPRB (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm) experiment, has been instrumental in examining various aspects of quantum mechanics, including entanglement, Bell's theorem, and teleportation principles. In its classic form, it consists of a source emitting pairs of photons at random intervals; one photon passes through a beam splitter while the other moves towards a detector. If we analyze whether each photon reaches one of the output ports of the beam splitter, we can confirm that exactly one photon arrives at each detector. This measurement can be performed locally on each photon without disturbing the state of the other. However, if we examine both photons jointly, they may arrive simultaneously at the same detector. For these experiments to demonstrate genuine quantum effects, the detectors must exhibit high efficiency to ensure that the likelihood of detecting more than one photon per pair is minimal. Previous implementations of Einstein-Bohr boxes have relied on inefficient single-photon detectors or avalanche photodiodes, which prevent us from distinguishing between different numbers of photons and hinder the observation of authentic quantum correlations.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK \n\nThe exploration of transport properties in mesoscopic devices has gained significant attention due to their potential applications in quantum processing. A particularly intriguing class of studies focuses on the transport of charge, especially under low-energy conditions where the relevant states are in close proximity to the Fermi surface. To address these phenomena, researchers typically consider models where electrons tunnel coherently between various regions connected by some form of potential barrier. These models, including single and multi-impurity configurations, have been extensively investigated through techniques that range from perturbative methods to numerical simulations. However, it has become evident that many crucial aspects cannot be captured through perturbative approaches alone, while conventional methods often struggle with severe limitations. For numerical simulations, they may fail to adequately address large systems and/or strong interactions. Consequently, alternative approaches have surfaced to better understand the underlying physics of these phenomena. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in developing frameworks for non-equilibrium transport that effectively map these systems onto paradigms from quantum mechanics, with one notable example being the Caldeira-Leggett model, which examines interactions involving quantum systems.",

One of the most intriguing phenomena observed experimentally in these systems is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Notably, it has been shown that when the number of electrons \\( N \\) is odd, the lowest Landau level (LLL) accommodates only one electron per magnetic flux quantum. The FQHE has garnered significant interest because it provides a unique platform for exploring many-body interactions in condensed matter physics. Recently, several researchers have analyzed the properties of the modified Coulomb interaction between two oppositely charged particles moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to their motion. They discovered that the ground state properties critically depend on whether the total angular momentum \\( J = L + S \\) is zero, where \\( L \\) represents the orbital angular momentum and \\( S \\) denotes the spin. For \\( J = 0 \\), the ground state energy exhibits a dependence characterized by \\( E_0 = -\\frac{e^2}{l_B} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\), where \\( l_B = \\frac{eB}{mc} \\) is the magnetic length.

        "rewrite_text": "We analyze the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and its stability properties for a class of ultimatum games characterized by two types of incomplete information. In this scenario, one player is uncertain about their type while the other is not. Our findings indicate that there exists a unique ESS that aligns with the Nash equilibrium when the set of types is either finite or compactly supported on the interval [0, 1]. However, if this set contains unbounded elements, we demonstrate that the ESS can become unstable with slight perturbations in the payoff functions. Specifically, it can be shown that any ESS must satisfy certain conditions related to the distribution of types. We also present numerical examples that illustrate our results. The ultimatum game serves as a framework for understanding how strategies evolve over time when players interact repeatedly within large populations. It provides a context for analyzing strategic interactions among self-interested agents who cannot commit in advance but can learn by observing past behaviors. A typical example of this situation occurs in bargaining scenarios where each player makes offers sequentially without knowledge of the proposals their opponents will make. This issue was notably studied by Guth et al. (1982), who introduced the standard ultimatum game as a model of bargaining between two self-interested parties. In this game, Player 1 proposes to split a fixed sum of money, M, into shares x and y = M - x for themselves and Player 2, respectively. Player 2 then either accepts or rejects the offer. If accepted, both players receive their proposed shares; if rejected, neither player receives anything. Since the foundational study by Guth et al., many researchers have explored various aspects of the ultimatum game, including the existence and multiplicity of equilibria and issues of efficiency due to power imbalances (see, e.g., Binmore & Shaked, 1993; Ochs & Roth, 1989).

Our results are compared to those obtained by numerically solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the Keldysh formalism.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe transport properties of nanoscale devices, such as molecular transistors, carbon nanotubes, semiconductor nanowires, and other emerging technologies, have garnered significant interest in recent years due to their potential applications in future electronic systems. However, recent studies have shown that these devices often operate well out of equilibrium, complicating the use of traditional approaches like the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. To accurately describe non-equilibrium phenomena, various extensions and modifications have been developed. These approaches typically focus on the idea that the timescales associated with different degrees of freedom (e.g., charge density) are much shorter than the characteristic timescales of the system. As a result, they often provide insights into scenarios where strong correlations lead to rapid equilibration. Moreover, many of these methods do not adequately address non-Markovian effects.",

We demonstrate how this method can yield families of black hole solutions with varying topologies. In particular, we construct rotating black rings with toroidal horizons.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS** \n\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has been pivotal in enhancing our understanding of various aspects of general relativity. However, constructing such solutions remains challenging due to the need to navigate complex nonlinear partial differential equations. This difficulty is exacerbated in cases involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nonetheless, several techniques have been developed to generate new solutions from simpler ones. One of the most effective methods involves transforming an original solution into another through nonholonomic frame transforms, which maintain certain properties of the spacetime while altering others. For instance, if the original solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations, the transformed solution does as well. In this work, we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to the Einstein equations to generate a variety of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes—specifically, those that possess at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves. Stationary axisymmetric spacetimes are significant in astrophysics, as they describe the exterior geometries of rotating stars, planets, and black holes.",

We find that selection against demographic stochasticity negatively influences reproductive effort later in life (see unpublished work, earlier reproduction) and leads to decreased survival rates later in life. This occurs because increased reproductive effort raises the number of offspring, which can result in higher mortality due to competition for resources among siblings. Conversely, reduced reproductive effort lowers competition, thereby diminishing the death toll from this source of demographic stochasticity. Our findings are robust across various levels of demographic stochasticity and initial population structures. The impacts of demographic stochasticity have been thoroughly examined, particularly in recovering populations. However, most research in this area focuses on populations without variations in reproductive strategies or assumes all individuals reproduce at the same age, which may not reflect reality. Here, we employ a model with stochastic demographic events to explore how selection influences life-history traits when individual ages at reproduction vary. Specifically, we examine scenarios where individuals can reproduce at different ages while competing for limited resources. Our results indicate that selection against demographic stochasticity enhances reproductive effort earlier in life while decreasing survival rates later in life. These findings are in line with previous theoretical work suggesting that selection favors strategies that optimize offspring production.",

We propose that in large ensembles, there is always one genotype that has higher fitness than any other. This genotype ultimately dominates all others when the system reaches equilibrium. The dominance of this genotype solely relies on the number of mutational distances between pairs of genotypes. For instance, if we compare two different distributions of mutational distances (exponential and power law), the same genotype will prevail in both scenarios. However, the time it takes to reach equilibrium can vary significantly based on how many mutations are required to connect to the dominant genotype. Specifically, when the number of mutations needed from the dominant genotype increases exponentially with distance, the system reaches equilibrium much sooner compared to a scenario where the number of mutations grows more slowly or remains constant. We suggest that the effective population size of the dominant genotype diminishes gradually over time until the system stabilizes.",

The SET is constructed on an exfoliated monolayer graphene flake and operates at cryogenic temperatures, down to 4 K. We find that the conductance through the SET is highly dependent on its alignment with the underlying graphene layer, which we attribute to variations in charge carrier density induced by charged impurities situated between the substrate and the graphene. This variation can be mitigated by applying a gate voltage of Vg = -40 V across the graphene sample. Our results demonstrate that SETs have significant potential as probes for investigating the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials like graphene. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the fabrication of devices based on carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and semiconductor heterostructures. These nanostructures serve as active components in various applications, including sensors, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics.

In contrast, graphene offers numerous advantages over other two-dimensional materials: it is mechanically strong, chemically stable, biocompatible, and highly conductive.

The results we obtain align with those derived using integrability methods. Additionally, we connect our findings to the graviton-graviton scattering, highlighting a wealth of potential states. These results arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincaré transformations, indicating corrections to the supergravity theory that are introduced by higher-order terms in the bulk field equations. \n\nIn the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we focus on type IIB superstrings propagating in a defected anti-de Sitter space and its relation to conformal field theories on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been extensively utilized to probe non-perturbative aspects of quantum gravity and offers a groundbreaking approach to studying strongly coupled gauge theories, such as QCD. In this paper, we examine the simplest case of the AdS/CFT correspondence: maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (N=4 SYM), whose dual corresponds to type IIA superstrings moving in AdS 5 × S 5. At weak ’t Hooft coupling (λ = g^2_YM N << 1), perturbative calculations have confirmed the exact match between these two descriptions. However, it remains a challenge to understand scattering amplitudes in the gauge theory at large coupling regimes. Conversely, the AdS/CFT correspondence allows for the translation of observables calculated in either framework.

Our approach utilizes the concept of shadowing trajectories, which serve as close approximations to the chaotic dynamics within an attractor. We demonstrate that our method can be employed to compute the topological entropy of chaotic maps with non-integer values. Additionally, we illustrate how this technique can be applied to analyze the behavior of coupled semiconductor lasers, particularly in relation to crash phenomena. Periodic behaviors play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of many nonlinear systems. They provide insights into the underlying structure of attractors associated with these systems. However, it has been established that identifying all periodic orbits of a given periodicity can be challenging due to their complex nature. This difficulty is exacerbated when dealing with chaotic systems, where the number of periodic orbits grows exponentially with the system's complexity. Previous research has proposed various numerical methods to identify these periodic orbits, but many of these approaches have notable drawbacks: (i) they require substantial computational resources, and (ii) they do not effectively converge to the desired periodic orbits. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address these issues through the use of shadowing techniques. Shadowing refers to the property that some trajectories closely approximate specific periodic orbits within the attractor. This concept was first articulated by Anosov, who demonstrated that any trajectory that starts sufficiently close to a specific periodic orbit will remain close to it for a significant duration. Since then, numerous authors have expanded upon this idea.",

Additionally, we present numerical simulations that illustrate the effect of multiplicative colored noise on the behavior of TWs. The propagation of traveling waves in excitable media has been the subject of extensive research, particularly concerning the influence of various instabilities such as i) backyard instabilities, ii) coupling-induced instabilities, and iii) complex oscillations. In many studies, it is often assumed that the underlying medium is homogeneous, meaning its properties do not vary spatially. However, real-world systems typically exhibit spatial heterogeneity. For instance, some cardiac models incorporate spatial variability in local refractory periods. Another significant factor influencing these systems is noise, which can play different roles depending on whether it acts additively or multiplicatively. Furthermore, noise can affect the dynamics of the propagating wavefront.",

        "rewrite_text": "We assert that any practical implementation of the Lie's NOT gate should be accompanied by an associated cost, which is defined by a universal constant multiplied by the number of qubits involved in the operation. This claim stems directly from our proof establishing a lower bound on the ground-state density of specific spins influenced by competing interactions and boundary effects. Our research focuses on the potential of realizing large-scale quantum computers using advanced technologies such as semiconductor quantum dots or trapped ions. We also intend to relate our findings to other types of quantum circuitry. The capability to perform universal unitary transformations on a system of n qubits provides a quantum computer with the potential to solve problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, it has been demonstrated that no classical computer can efficiently simulate all quantum processes unless there is a collapse of the complexity hierarchy. Thus, practical quantum computing necessitates the efficient implementation of only those quantum operations which cannot be classically computed. To achieve this, one must be capable of executing fundamental operations such as single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and other essential interactions. In particular, the CNOT (controlled-NOT) gate plays a crucial role, as it allows for the construction of many significant quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, there is currently no straightforward method for realizing a general CNOT gate, although several proposals have emerged recently. These proposals often involve coupling the states of individual atoms using magnetic fields and/or optical cavities. While some progress has been made towards the development of small-scale quantum computers, scaling these technologies poses significant challenges.",

The interaction between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), both crucial materials for high-temperature superconductivity, displays notable efficacy despite the significant lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. Our findings indicate that charge transfer across the manganite occurs due to strong orbital hybridization, not due to lattice defects. We detected that the electron density in YBCO can be modulated by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer deposited on it. These results showcase a novel method for engineering carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has only been observed in specific configurations where the CuO2 layers are present. In these configurations, holes introduced into the CuO2 layers are essential for the formation of Cooper pairs that enable superconductivity. However, the highest transition temperature (Tc = 92 K) reported in this class of materials remains below the critical limit established by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, raising questions about strategies to enhance Tc. Recent efforts have been directed at investigating new pathways to improve Tc beyond its current limits. One promising approach involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 layers, such as replacing copper atoms in the CuO2 lattice with fluorine, effectively increasing hole concentration. Alternatively, electrons can be introduced into the CuO2 layers by growing thin films of various oxide materials like SrTiO3 or LaAlO3 onto cuprate superconductors' surfaces. Although these methods show potential, they necessitate precise control over film composition during deposition. In contrast, a different strategy focuses on manipulating the carrier density in cuprates without altering their crystal structures.",

        "rewrite_text": "We provide observational constraints on the cosmic ray (CR) density and its evolution with redshift, utilizing gamma-ray pulses detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the redshift range of 0 < z < 1.5. Our findings indicate that cosmic rays contribute at most 10% to the total energy budget of the universe at redshifts below 2. This upper limit aligns with prior research regarding cosmic rays accelerated by supernovae. The results are consistent with existing data from various studies. These constraints can serve as priors when modeling the impact of cosmic rays on cosmological observables such as large-scale structure or weak lensing. Cosmic rays, charged particles that permeate the universe uniformly over vast distances, have been detected throughout our galaxy and beyond. They are crucial in numerous astrophysical phenomena including galaxy formation and the dynamics of supernova remnants. However, their origin remains largely unknown. In this study, we leverage gamma-ray data collected by the LAT on the Fermi satellite to impose stringent constraints on the role of cosmic rays in the overall energy budget of the universe. Specifically, we explore two different models for the cosmic ray density function \\( f(z) \\). First, we assume a power-law spectrum \\( dN/dE \\sim E^{-n} \\) for energies ranging from \\( E_{\\text{min}} = 10 \\) GeV to \\( E_{\\text{max}} = 100 \\) TeV; alternatively, we consider a broken power-law model where the spectral index transitions from \\( \\alpha_1 = -2.2 \\) to \\( \\alpha_2 = -3 \\) at a break energy \\( E_b = 50 \\) GeV. In both cases, we normalize the function \\( f(z) \\) such that its integral over all momenta equals unity. The resulting cosmic ray distributions are illustrated in Figure 1.

This document outlines our approach to enhancing our understanding of the systematic uncertainties that impact the analysis of the FD data. \n\nIntroduction: The primary goal of the Double Chooz experiment is to accurately measure the third mixing angle \\( \\theta_{13} \\). The experiment utilizes a reactor-based neutrino source situated approximately 1 km from the near detector ND280, which consists of several sub-detectors surrounding a target volume where neutrinos are detected. The ultimate objective is to observe the transition of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos generated at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), as shown in Figure 1. \n\nTo maintain measurement accuracy within a reasonable timeframe, the experiment is conducted in two phases. Phase I took place from 2011 to 2014, during which only one of the four potential detectors was operational. Phase II has recently begun and is expected to continue until 2019 or 2020, with plans to have all detectors fully functional by then.

Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing solutions under various scenarios. \n\n**Index Terms:** Data Recovery, EM Algorithm, Multiuser Detection, Time-Varying Channels. \n\n**1. Introduction:** Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for wireless communication due to its high spectral efficiency. However, CDMA systems suffer from significant interference among users, particularly due to multipath propagation, especially when the number of active users increases. To mitigate inter-user interference, various multiuser detectors have been developed. Among them, linear multiuser detectors are favored for their low-cost implementation. Unfortunately, these detectors experience performance limitations when compared to more complex multiuser detectors. To enhance their performance, nonlinear multiuser detectors, such as successive interference cancellation and parallel interference cancellation, have been proposed. These advanced detectors utilize knowledge about the received signals, leading to the development of blind multiuser detectors that estimate unknown parameters without requiring a training sequence. Despite lacking prior information about the received signals, blind multiuser detectors often perform worse than their more informed counterparts. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in designing multiuser detectors tailored for time-varying channels. As channel conditions fluctuate over time, accurately detecting transmitted symbols becomes more challenging. Moreover, if the channel changes rapidly, the detector's performance may deteriorate significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to design robust multiuser detection schemes that can effectively handle rapid channel variations.",

Our findings indicate that these models successfully replicate numerous experimental results related to molecular interactions with a high degree of accuracy. Notably, we observe that the force exerted by the motors can be characterized by an exponential function at lower forces, but deviates from this behavior as the force increases. The mean squared displacement suggests subdiffusive behavior under significant loads, which we attribute to the elasticity of the cargoes being managed by the motors. Our simulations also reflect the experimentally observed relationship between pause forces and external viscous drag. Furthermore, we propose that the distance moved per ATP hydrolysis decreases exponentially with the load, which helps to explain why step size fluctuations become more pronounced near stalling conditions. \n\nMolecular motors are crucial for numerous biological processes, including muscle contraction, vesicle transport, chromosome segregation, and cell motility. They transform chemical energy into mechanical work through repetitive interactions with cytoskeletal filaments (such as microtubules) and through their release. Kinesins, the most extensively studied class of molecular motors, traverse microtubules toward their plus ends, while myosins move along actin filaments toward their minus ends. Both motor types have been observed to pause as they transport loads. Recent studies show that kinesins and myosins display stochastic stepping behavior even in the absence of external loads. It has been suggested that this randomness may be due to fluctuations in internal forces or variations in cargo elasticity. However, several questions remain regarding their response to external loads.

The transition between these phases occurs when the Hubble parameter becomes comparable to the mass scale associated with the interaction term. During this transition, we observe oscillatory behavior in both the Hubble parameter and the energy densities of each individual field. Moreover, we find that the total energy density decreases at a slower rate than it would if only one type of field were present (i.e., either a tachyonic field or a canonical scalar field). Finally, we discuss how our model can be utilized to construct viable inflationary scenarios.

        "rewrite_text": "We present results from Santos scattering experiments conducted on paused magnetic excitations in the underdoped cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3Ox (x = 6.35). Our observations indicate that both the pause and linewidth of the low-energy spin excitations diminish with increasing temperature up to T* ~ 150 K, which is approximately 50 K above the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. This behavior can be understood within the framework of the spin-fermion model, suggesting that the spin-wave amplitudes decrease sharply near T* due to the coupling to fermionic quasiparticles. This model also implies that a pseudogap emerges below T*, as previously suggested. \n\nIntroduction: There has been significant interest in studying the properties of high-temperature superconductors through various experimental techniques. Neutron scattering allows us to examine not only the static structure factor S(Q) but also dynamic correlations involving phonons and magnons. Recent findings reveal that the low-energy spin excitation spectrum in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O3 exhibits unusual characteristics compared to previous studies. Notably, this spectrum shows a strong anisotropic dispersion along different crystallographic directions and displays significant deviations from theoretical predictions based on spin dynamics. These observations have prompted further investigations into how these spin properties relate to the electronic structure of the CuO2 planes. However, there has been limited research on how doping levels affect spin dynamics. In this work, we provide new data on an underdoped sample of YBa2Cu3OX (x = 6.35), focusing on the effects of reduced doping on spin excitation properties.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present the tenth of three Jurassic MHD simulations that investigate how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, leading to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-gas ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. Our findings indicate that increased compression results in higher density and temperature in the core region. Consequently, the pressure gradient across the surrounding area rapidly decreases over time. This allows for the recovery of magnetic field lines that become more tangled due to turbulent motions generated by the shock wave. Additionally, we observe that the magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the turbulent fingers. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic mass-to-density ratio to rise significantly within the shocked region. \n\nKeywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence\n\n1. Introduction\n\nMolecular clouds play a crucial role in star formation (SF) as they provide the environment for stars to form. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms drive SF within molecular clouds. One possibility is supersonic turbulence induced by supernova explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another scenario suggests that large-scale compression events can trigger localized fragmentation, leading to the formation of dense cores that evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al., 1997). It has been proposed that both mechanisms may act simultaneously during different periods of evolution in molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). Recent observational studies have shown that many star-forming regions are associated with filamentary structures detected in infrared emission maps (André et al., 2010; Peretto et al., 2013). These filaments appear to align along magnetic fields inferred from polarization observations (Chapman et al., 2011), suggesting that magnetic fields play a significant role in regulating the dynamics of these regions. Indeed, theoretical models indicate that magnetic fields can influence the stability properties of self-gravitating structures against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomisaka).",

Nevertheless, despite the significant research conducted, a satisfactory explanation remains elusive for why the excited state of 3He is unbound while the excited state of 4He is bound. To better understand the structure of helium, we propose a theoretical framework in which the electron is characterized not only by its charge but also by its momentum vector.

        "rewrite_text": "We analyze the dynamics of a particle system on a lattice with an asymmetric configuration involving two types of particles arranged in a ring. In this setup, particles can move to their immediate left or right neighbors and experience repulsive interactions within a defined range. We demonstrate that for any initial configuration of particles, there exists a unique stationary state characterized by a density that solely depends on the distance between lattice sites. Notably, this density diminishes exponentially as one moves away from the origin. This finding indicates that the particle correlations also decay exponentially at large distances, despite the absence of translational invariance in the underlying microscopic interactions. Our proof employs techniques from probability theory, particularly martingale methods, and functional analysis. These results hold for both finite and infinite lattice systems.\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nResearch into the dynamics of lattice gases has significantly advanced our understanding of nonequilibrium steady states. These models illustrate the behavior of particles according to stochastic rules, enabling the preservation of detailed balance in certain scenarios. One well-studied class involves exclusion processes where particles move along a linear array subject to constraints. In these systems, each site can host either zero or one particle, and allowed transitions occur to neighboring sites only if they are unoccupied. When these movements are independent, the associated Markov process fulfills detailed balance with respect to a specific product measure. However, if the dynamics depend on the occupancy of nearby sites, this balance is disrupted. Despite lacking equilibrium behavior, many of these models exhibit intriguing features that parallel phenomena observed in equilibrium systems.",

We demonstrate that for any positive feedback capacity, there exists a sequence of (2, n) codes such that each code achieves a rate of at least R. This result is established by integrating polar coding techniques with concepts from successive cancellation list decoding. Our proof relies on a new converse bound for the secrecy capacity region of the wiretap channel with feedback. Additionally, we present numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of our achievability results. In this work, we build on the foundational framework set forth by Wyner in his analysis of the wiretap channel. Specifically, we concentrate on the scenario where the legitimate user receives feedback about previous transmissions to enhance their decoding strategies. Our results demonstrate that polar codes combined with successive cancellation list decoding come close to achieving secrecy rates when applied to channels with feedback. Furthermore, we show that if the number of messages increases exponentially with respect to the block length, then every message can be reliably transmitted using codes with a rate that scales linearly in relation to the number of messages.

We utilized single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to track GluR2-containing AMPA receptors tagged with a fluorescent marker in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Our findings revealed two distinct trafficking pathways for receptors to be delivered to synapses. First, receptors diffuse laterally along the membrane until they encounter an existing synapse, where they become trapped. Second, receptors that undergo endocytosis are encapsulated in endosomal vesicles and recycle back to the cell surface through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes before being targeted to new synapses.

We find that SN 2005bf exhibits several unusual characteristics among this group. Notably, it has a very rapid decline rate during its nebular phase, suggesting that its ejecta mass could be significantly larger than that typically seen in ordinary core-collapse supernovae. This implies that the progenitor star was likely massive enough to form a black hole directly, without experiencing a supernova phase. If this is accurate, we anticipate that the central engine of the associated GRB was likely powered by accretion onto the black hole rather than by radioactive decay processes.

Our analysis shows that when there is a lack of common knowledge among traders regarding the true state of the variable, they tend to disagree on its perceived value, even if all have access to the same information. This disagreement leads to price fluctuations that can be exacerbated by the presence of noise traders who base their decisions on misleading indicators. Consequently, we find that this behavior results in volatility clustering and fat tails, which align with observed empirical characteristics. Additionally, we demonstrate that these effects remain significant in both stable and turbulent market conditions, exhibiting non-Gaussian statistical properties.

We found no excess emissions above the background levels, and we established upper limits on the fluxes of dark matter annihilation products. These limits can be used to constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model that predict the existence of stable dark matter particles, which would produce gamma-ray signals similar to those expected from dark matter annihilation. The GC is considered one of the most promising locations for indirect searches for dark matter due to the large concentrations of dark matter present in a small volume. Furthermore, there are astrophysical sources near the GC that can accelerate protons to energies sufficient to create gamma rays through processes such as pion production or inverse Compton scattering off ambient photons. However, these sources could complicate the interpretation of any observed gamma-ray signals associated with dark matter annihilation.",

The results are compared to those derived when varying these six orbital elements alongside the radius ratio of the moon to its host planet and the host's orbital parameters simultaneously.

Notably, the presence of moons around extrasolar giant planets provides significant insights into the formation processes of such bodies. Here, we propose an innovative strategy to estimate the characteristics of exomoons based exclusively on the analysis of their transit light curves. This method does not require any prior knowledge of the planet's orbital parameters and enables the detection of moons with high inclinations or eccentricities relative to the inclination of the system.

These techniques are particularly applicable to various fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, computer science, bioinformatics, and more, where they facilitate deeper exploration of complex data. In general, N qubits can encode M elements in a database. For Grover's algorithm, the required number of iterations is O(√(N/M)) to locate any specific entry from M elements stored in N qubits.

We find that all three sources exhibit evidence of infall on scales ranging from 1000 AU to 10000 AU. Additionally, we detect outflows associated with two of these sources. These observations suggest that the formation process of these protostars is characterized by rapid mass accretion onto the central object through a circumstellar disk. This accretion may be influenced by gravitational collapse or magneto-rotational instabilities within the core. Lastly, our SMA maps reveal extended emission around each source, which could represent molecular envelopes or disks surrounding the protostar.

We observed that these structures form spontaneously on mica surfaces at room temperature after the lipids are added to the solution. The height profiles indicate that the thicknesses of the individual layers range from 1 to 2 nanometers, depending on their composition. By analyzing the lateral diffusion of the layers over time, we can assess their mobility. Our findings show that the mobility of the layers is significantly influenced by the number of layers present. Specifically, while most of the single-layer structures can diffuse freely over large areas, the two-layer structures exhibit only limited displacement perpendicular to the surface. This behavior suggests that mobility decreases when more than one layer is present.",

This phenomenon can be explained by the formation of bound pairs of vacancies that cluster together due to their mutual attraction.

Much of this research relies on observations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SMBHs across various astronomical scales. However, due to their inherent complexities, directly measuring the luminosities of most AGNs can be challenging. Instead, researchers often use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between different properties of AGNs to estimate their luminosities. For example, if one were to analyze how light behaves as it interacts with regions of interest within an AGN, one could derive its luminosity using geometrical considerations. Alternatively, knowing the distance to an AGN allows for its apparent magnitude to be determined. Unfortunately, both methods require detailed knowledge of the emitting regions, which is not always accessible through observational means. Consequently, to derive more reliable estimates of the luminosities of AGNs, it is essential to utilize models that can reproduce the observed SEDs of nearby AGNs effectively.",

This metric has several advantages over existing proposals, demonstrating positive features in the effective action and eliminating issues related to counterterms at higher orders. We explore how this metric can be utilized to compute effective functions up to stationary points in perturbative expansions, relying solely on Feynman diagrams with single-loop contributions as fundamental components. This approach allows us to calculate the effective function for the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar, yielding results consistent with those found in other studies, though they have not been easily accessible due to technical challenges. Furthermore, we present evidence for non-trivial fixed points in the effective action of the coupling constant. These findings reinforce the notion that the worldsheet sigma model can serve as a valuable framework for examining quantum gravity.\n\nIntroduction: It was recently demonstrated that the worldsheet sigma model (WSSM) is a powerful tool for investigating quantum gravity through its connection to the tensionless string integral. One particularly intriguing aspect of this framework is the computational efficiency it provides in obtaining perturbative corrections to the WSSM effective action from the path integral, without the need for intricate calculations of graviton exchanges or loops. It has been suggested that the WSSM could also be applied to study the flow of couplings under the renormalization group (RG). However, given that the WSSM encompasses infinitely many degrees of freedom, there is no finite parameter space where RG flow can occur in a conventional sense. Instead, the RG flow must take place along specific trajectories through the vast landscape of all potential models. To facilitate exploration and understanding of such trajectories, it would be advantageous to define a suitable metric on the space of WSSM couplings that allows for comparisons between different models. This metric should enable us to determine whether two points in the space of WSSMs are close together or far apart.",

We found no evidence suggesting contributions from incoherent synchrotron or bremsstrahlung processes. These results offer valuable insights into the physics of cosmic rays at high energies and demonstrate the potential of this research for investigating phenomena such as thunderstorms. \n\nKeywords: Cosmic rays, Radio emission, Air showers, Coherence, Synchrotron radiation\n\nRecently, there has been increased interest in developing novel methods for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays based on their interactions with the Earth's atmosphere. One promising approach involves measuring the radio frequency (RF) emission produced when UHE cosmic rays collide with the atmosphere, which can be detected remotely over large distances. A key characteristic of this RF emission is a broad broadband pulse lasting several microseconds.

        "rewrite_text": "We analyze the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of gauged chiral supergravities in six dimensions, with a particular focus on their supersymmetric AdS7 vacua. Our findings indicate that these systems are not free at high energies; rather, they possess a nontrivial fixed point characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom. This analysis is facilitated by employing the recently developed method of holographic renormalization to compute the flow of the gauge coupling constants, as well as the contributions from higher-derivative terms in the effective action. The resulting insights can help stabilize the scalar potential against quantum corrections. Notably, we demonstrate the existence of a broad class of models that exhibit metastable de Sitter vacua. These findings provide further evidence for the existence of stable non-supersymmetric AdS7 vacua in this context. \n\nIntroduction: It has previously been established that certain classes of N = 1 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions can be derived from compactifications of type IIA strings on Calabi-Yau threefolds, denoted as X3. Additionally, it was found that such constructions typically yield massive gravitons in five dimensions, with their masses scaling as M²_grav ∼ V⁻³, where V represents the volume of X3. Consequently, one anticipates that the five-dimensional gravitational constant G5 will exhibit logarithmic running behavior. It was proposed that this behavior could be mitigated by considering non-perturbative effects stemming from Euclidean D3-branes, which contribute to the Lagrangian through the term L ∈ H⁴(X3; Z). Indeed, these instanton effects generate a term proportional to R ∧ R in the low-energy effective theory. If this term dominates over other contributions, the resulting vacuum solution should correspond to an anti-de Sitter space. Furthermore, since the instanton contributions scale as g_s⁻¹, where g_s is the string coupling constant, one can conclude that the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space decreases rapidly in the weak coupling limit. Thus, achieving a phenomenologically viable scenario requires careful consideration of these dynamics.",

Our study examines how these processes impact the structure of grain size distributions and their spatial distribution within the disk. Specifically, we find that: (i) The grain sizes are constrained to a range between 1 mm and 10 cm, depending on the intensity of the UV radiation; (ii) Larger grains are expelled from the inner regions of the disk due to lower density and heat; (iii) Fragmentation occurs more readily near the star, where increased energy leads to higher collisional velocities.

We found evidence for a compact source contributing to this emission, located within 0.5 arcseconds (approximately 0.1 parsecs) of the nucleus. This nuclear source has been identified as a compact, paused core and is a near-infrared continuum source, previously unobserved in noble spectral bands.

We explore two different models for the entangled quantum system: (i) a model where interactions occur locally at each site, and (ii) a model where interactions occur globally across all sites simultaneously. In both scenarios, we find that there are conditions under which the system can evolve into highly entangled states, even when starting from an unentangled or only weakly entangled state. This phenomenon occurs because the environment acts as a source of interference, facilitating the transition to a more entangled state. Local coupling effects are more significant than global coupling effects, as local interactions lead to faster relaxation times. Additionally, we find that these results hold true even if the initial state contains some degree of spatial correlations. Quantum mechanics often requires the manipulation of entangled states over large scales. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the surrounding environment, such manipulations cannot be performed easily.

        "rewrite_text": "We present an analysis of the stability of paused protoplanetary systems in which embryos evolve under oligarchic conditions. In this scenario, they can eject each other's materials but cannot expel their own. We propose that this mechanism leads to the rapid growth of the largest embryo until it achieves a critical mass, known as the threshold for runaway accretion. This process ultimately results in the formation of either a single massive planet or a pair of planets with similar sizes, depending on the proximity of the initial conditions to instability. This system is significantly different from scenarios where all bodies interact simultaneously; notably, we find that multiple stable outcomes can exist even when starting from identical conditions. Our findings suggest that the formation of gas giant planets may have occurred through several oligarchic stages before reaching their final state, as observed in current systems. Additionally, our research sheds light on the origins of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos located in circumstellar disks, affected by gravitational interactions and dynamic instabilities, experience frequent collisions during their growth process. If these interactions happen often enough, only one body may survive by the end of the growth phase, resulting in a single planet. Conversely, we also find that many protoplanetary systems can accommodate more than one planet without catastrophic outcomes. We propose that these embryos follow a hierarchical evolution, with interactions leading to gravitational instabilities and subsequent growth through runaway accretion once the largest embryo exceeds its critical mass. Utilizing simulations, we demonstrate that this framework effectively accounts for the existence of gas giant planets while also mimicking the properties of observed exoplanets.",

This suggests that the effects of backreaction become more significant closer to the critical point than away from it. Additionally, we observe that the deconfinement temperature increases monotonically with the chemical potential (or charge density) at a fixed curvature radius.

We consider potentials that are decaying, but not necessarily Griffith or even continuous, and we also allow the external magnetic fields to be time-dependent while still remaining bounded. In particular, our results apply to situations where the potential is composed of the sum of a quadratic form and a small perturbation. The methods employed in this study are based on the so-called \"Bourgain-Goldstein method,\" which is effective in analyzing the behavior of the Wigner transform of the solution to the Schrödinger equation under the action of the unitary transformation generated by the corresponding Hamiltonian.\n\nThe objective of this article is to demonstrate that there exists at most one equilibrium state associated with a given class of potentials within the framework of classical mechanics, especially when these potentials interact with an external magnetic field. This result was initially proven by D. Ruelle, who showed that if V: Td → R satisfies certain conditions, then there exists a unique equilibrium state µV. These conditions include the requirement that V exhibits superlinear growth at infinity and adheres to a form of ellipticity. However, many interesting examples do not meet these criteria. For instance, consider the following two examples: • If V = −|x|^2 + |y|^2, then V does not grow faster than linearly at infinity.",

Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

        "rewrite_text": "We examine the wetting properties of a fluid interacting with a solid wall, utilizing a disk model that allows for precise computational analyses. The interaction potential is characterized by a short-range repulsion and a long-range attraction that decreases exponentially at large distances. We investigate how the density of the fluid near the wall varies as a function of the surface tension between the liquid and the wall. Notably, we find that there is no true equilibrium state that corresponds to complete wetting by the fluid; instead, the interface becomes rough when the temperature falls below a critical threshold \\( T^* \\). This behavior is attributed to the exponential decay of the potential, which leads to significant fluctuations in the density of the fluid adsorbed onto the wall. These fluctuations account for the non-analytic behavior observed in both the density profiles and the surface structures.\n\n**Introduction:**\nWetting phenomena occur when two phases are in contact with each other. For instance, liquid droplets form on glass surfaces due to capillary forces, while oil spreads over water. A particularly interesting scenario arises when one of the phases has lower dimensionality than the others, leading to various types of interfaces. This situation is common, for example, in cases where a thin film coexists with its vapor or in structured geometries. Here, we present a disk model to investigate the wetting properties of a fluid in contact with walls. Our findings suggest that even though the interface between the liquid and the wall rapidly changes, nontrivial effects persist. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the presence of a wall induces pronounced fluctuations in the density of fluid adsorbed on its surface. As a result, the boundary separating the liquid phase (consisting of many droplets) from the vapor phase (or the surrounding atmosphere) becomes rough when the temperature is lowered below a specific threshold \\( T^* \\). Below this temperature, the average distance between neighboring droplets increases significantly, resulting in a fractal-like structure. \n\n**Model Details:**\nThe model we use consists of \\( N \\) identical particles...",

This has led to the development of several successful models that account for the prompt emission of GRBs (e.g., Piran 2005; Zhang 2007), but more work is needed to accurately describe the afterglow emissions. A notable feature of many afterglows is the appearance of a steepening or a break in the light curve approximately one day after the burst (Rhoads 1999). These breaks have often been interpreted as indicating when the relativistic ejecta become optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption, allowing the emission to evolve rapidly. However, some researchers propose that such breaks may occur if the ejecta continue to interact dynamically after the initial explosion (e.g., Kumar & Panaitescu 2000; Granot et al. 2001; Chevalier & Li 2000), while others suggest they could result from changes in the geometry of the emitting region (e.g., Racusin et al. 2008).

These constraints generate gauge transformations ensuring that all physical quantities remain invariant. To correctly account for the degrees of freedom, we must impose secondary constraints that eliminate unphysical modes. Finally, we carry out the canonical quantization process by promoting the phase space variables to operators that act on wave functions defined over superspace (the space of all possible metrics).

This method is adaptable to various types of networks and does not require any prior knowledge about their structure or patterns. Our approach allows for the estimation of the volume of active flows at each node based on the data transmitted across each network segment. We validate our findings through simulations conducted with real Internet traffic traces. Network tomography has been extensively studied in recent years due to its potential applications in areas such as computer recovery, quality of service provisioning, and network engineering. In this context, we aim to estimate certain properties of the network's internal state—such as the number of active flows per node or data volume along each link—by solely observing external measurements (i.e., link-count statistics). This task becomes significantly more complex in large-scale networks, as the range of potential states increases exponentially with network size. To address these challenges, several recent approaches have explored characteristics of the underlying networks, such as sparsity, symmetry, or regularity. However, most existing methods either assume prior knowledge of the network structure or depend on specific configurations that may not hold in practical scenarios, particularly in large or dynamic networks. In IP-based networks, for example, the exact locations of routers may not always be apparent, and patterns of internal flows are typically unknown. Even if certain traffic characteristics were known, the overall analysis might still be impractical due to scalability issues. Ultimately, obtaining accurate assessments of network traffic remains a complex challenge.",

We demonstrate how EDS can facilitate efficient exploration of diverse designs through evolutionary techniques. To illustrate our approach, we present two case studies—one synthetic and one biological. Robustness is recognized as a crucial characteristic of living systems, particularly during embryogenesis, where cells differentiate into distinct tissues and organs, but it can also be challenging in live environments. In this study, we propose a new framework for designing robust multicellular systems. Our approach effectively integrates the strengths of both bottom-up and top-down strategies while addressing some of their shortcomings. Bottom-up methods often focus on cellular differentiation or morphogenetic processes, typically beginning with a single cell type and gradually evolving more complex structures through successive divisions or mutations. Conversely, top-down methods employ genetic programming or other optimization techniques to design systems according to predefined constraints. However, these approaches often necessitate a substantial number of parameters and can result in local optima.

        "rewrite_text": "We present a technique for studying optical precursors in ultrashort laser pulses propagating through dispersive media, which relies on the interplay of nonlinear amplitude modulation through self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM). The proposed methodology enables us to accurately characterize both the temporal and spectral aspects of these phenomena. We demonstrate that this approach can be utilized to predict the behavior of weakly recovering optical transients (WFCOT), specifically the generation of sub-femtosecond pulses with high peak power at specific wavelengths within the pulse spectrum. This technique is validated experimentally using a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond oscillator operating at 800 nm. Additionally, we illustrate how our findings have implications for applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy and attosecond science. The observation of optical precursors dates back to the early developments in ultrafast optics. These phenomena occur when intense laser pulses propagate through dispersive media such as glass, air, and crystals. Earlier theoretical explanations assumed that the pulse dynamics were governed by a slowly varying envelope approximation. However, recent research has shown that this assumption is inadequate for accurately capturing the nuances of experimental results. To address this limitation, several researchers have developed more sophisticated models. Notably, the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) has proven highly effective as it accounts for all orders of dispersion, self-steepening, pulse reshaping, Raman scattering, stimulated Brillouin scattering, self-frequency shift, temporal defocusing, gain saturation, and other non-stationary effects. Despite its successes, some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental findings remain. For example, the GNLSE suggests that the shape of the precursor should always exhibit a distinct bell-like profile.",

Our objective is to understand how BBHs can gain mass through accretion during their evolution when surrounded by dense gas. Specifically, we examine whether these systems can achieve masses sufficient for merging within a Hubble time. The initial parameters for our models were derived using a Monte Carlo approach based on the distribution function of BBHs as constructed by Belczynski et al. (2010). For each model, we conducted multiple simulations starting from different orbital configurations, assuming circular orbits. We found that most binary systems merge within a few hundred million years after formation due to gravitational wave emission. However, some persist longer if they exist in regions where the surrounding gas density exceeds $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$.

        "rewrite_text": "We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the result of collisions between primordial black holes and stars in globular clusters, occurring under the conditions outlined by current models of GRB formation. Our hypothesis suggests that this scenario can account for many observed characteristics of GRBs, including their duration, luminosity function, redshift distribution, and beaming fraction. The model predicts the existence of an observable population of binary systems consisting of both a star and a primordial black hole, which could provide additional evidence to differentiate it from other theories. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Figure 1) are intense high-energy events lasting from milliseconds to several seconds. They have been detected at redshifts up to z = 8, indicating their occurrence over one billion years after the Big Bang. The primary explanation for these phenomena suggests they arise when massive stars collapse into black holes. However, several challenges to this explanation have arisen: first, the estimated rate of such events required to account for all observed GRBs is based on star formation estimates; second, the outflow dynamics during the explosion do not correlate with the brightest GRBs; third, while the density of detectable GRBs rapidly decreases with increasing redshift, some models indicate that the rate of GRBs should rise; finally, if GRBs were primarily formed through collapsars, we would expect them to be more evenly distributed across the sky, yet observations show that they tend to cluster. To address these discrepancies, alternative models involving mergers of compact objects, tidal disruption events, and hypernovae have been proposed. Additionally,...",

We demonstrate that NEPs can effectively characterize various types of stochastic resonances, particularly those observed in excitable and bistable systems near their Hopf bifurcation points. Notably, we find that the presence of noise enhances the oscillatory dynamics in both scenarios, albeit in markedly different ways. For excitable systems, the increase in noise facilitates transitions across the threshold between two stable states; meanwhile, for bistable systems, noise induces oscillations between these states. Finally, we relate our findings to previous studies that utilized alternative methodologies. Stochastic resonance has been extensively researched over the years. It refers to the phenomenon in which weak signals can be detected or amplified when embedded in noise. However, many studies also need to consider the influence of internal fluctuations within the system itself. This issue becomes more critical when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, which can occur if the signal is intrinsically weak or if its intensity is affected by external disruptions. Moreover, even when the signal is robust enough to be detected clearly without any noise, there still exists an optimal level of noise that maximizes recovery efficiency.",

Our calculations indicate that the Kuiper Belt developed through a process of collisional grinding among bodies sized similar to Pluto (approximately 1,000 km). This resulted in a population of smaller bodies with orbital eccentricities reaching up to 0.3. Interactions with Neptune subsequently scattered some of these bodies into highly eccentric orbits.

This phenomenon can be attributed to the competition between the Zeeman energy barrier from the external magnetic field and the activation energy barrier associated with temperature fluctuations in the anisotropy. The model considers two identical particles (each with radius R) separated by a distance d along the axis of interest. Each particle has its own uniaxial anisotropy constant K_s(T), where T is the temperature. Additionally, they are exchange-coupled via a coupling constant J.

We propose that, under optimal conditions, this system can be accurately described by a master equation in Lindblad form. The resulting master equations facilitate the examination of how fluctuations impact the stationary density state of the system. We specifically analyze two different models: the Ohmic dissipation and the spin-boson model. For both models, we illustrate how the dynamics of the system can lead to irreversible changes from the initial state and contribute to thermalization over time. Additionally, we explore potential applications of our framework to scenarios such as transport in mesoscopic conductors and dissipative tunneling between discrete states in disordered solids. Decoherence and quantum fluctuations are crucial for understanding the physics of these interactions, especially when considering how the system interacts with external degrees of freedom (the environment), which can often be ignored. In recent years, significant interest has emerged in developing methods capable of addressing these effects beyond conventional perturbative approaches. Various strategies have been proposed, from stochastic Schrödinger equations to more microscopic approaches utilizing path integrals or quantum field theoretical formulations. However, a common limitation of these methods is their inability to provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms driving decoherence and dissipation, or to allow for predictions about time scales. Recently, some researchers have suggested that the problem might be approached from the perspective of quantum mechanics itself, a concept initially put forth by Feynman, who demonstrated that the emergent properties of macroscopic systems could be explained by averaging across an ensemble of identical yet microscopically distinct realizations of the same experiment. More recently, Leggett has proposed a method to further this understanding.",

We use vector magnetograms obtained by SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI instruments as well as photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms provided by GONG network. The evolution of the coronal magnetic field is studied using potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model. In addition we perform NLFFF extrapolations with different codes for comparison purposes. Our results show that both PFSS and NLFFF models are able to reproduce the large-scale structure of the corona but differ significantly at small scales. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the effect of plasma flows along open field lines. Finally, we study the relationship between the observed photospheric motions and the changes in the coronal magnetic field.

Theoretically, there are two types of tunneling: extrinsic tunneling, which occurs when particles move through a potential created by external forces, and intrinsic tunneling, where particles transition between degenerate states without any potential barrier. Intrinsic tunneling plays a critical role in numerous phenomena, such as molecular vibrations, nuclear fission, Josephson junctions, Bose-Einstein condensates, and semiconductor superlattices.

Our findings indicate that these mixtures exhibit complex phase diagrams, showing liquid coexistence at low volume fractions for all compositions examined (0.25 < f < 0.75), where f represents the fraction of particles made up by the smaller species. The binodal lines of liquid coexistence shift to higher volume fractions as the size ratio between the two particle types increases. For large size ratios, we identify a region in the phase diagram where both types of particles have the same densities yet exhibit different structural properties. This fluid state has been observed experimentally in colloidal suspensions containing nonadsorbing polymers. Our results align well with existing data on colloid-polymer mixtures across a broad spectrum of temperatures, densities, and compositions.\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**  \nThe presence of small particles can significantly influence the properties of larger particles through depletion forces. These interactions are crucial in various phenomena, such as protein crystallization, gelation, and sedimentation. Depending on their relative sizes, the mixtures can either be miscible or immiscible. Furthermore, regions of metastability and multiple phases can exist. Several studies have explored the impact of depletion attractions on the phase behavior of simple mixtures. However, most of these studies often relied on idealized models that ignored hydrodynamic effects, finite-size effects, polydispersity, and other complexities. Recently, some authors have begun incorporating more realistic features such as Brownian motion, electrostatic repulsion, and van der Waals attraction. Despite these advances, accurately predicting the phase boundaries remains challenging due to strong correlations among system variables.

Notably, it lacks fundamental principles to explain why the SM includes three generations of quarks and leptons with such varying masses, or how gravity integrates into this framework. Theories that extend beyond the Standard Model aim to tackle these issues by introducing new particles and phenomena that could be detected in experiments. For example, supersymmetry (SUSY) proposes that every SM particle has a superpartner with a spin that differs by one-half. These superpartners share the same gauge quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, making it possible for them to interact if SUSY exists at low energy scales. This could lead to observable deviations from SM predictions for quantities such as cross sections and decay rates. Many extensions of the Standard Model also predict new phenomena related to extra dimensions of space-time. For instance, models that incorporate extra dimensions often suggest these dimensions are compactified to extremely small scales.

In this setup, each operation is limited to having at most one excited state. Our research focuses on how to approach the problem, assuming such circuits exist. Our approach is informed by previous work that shows any time-independent Hamiltonian can be expressed as a sum of commuting projectors onto its eigenstates. This decomposition allows us to simplify the challenge of finding a realization of a general time-independent Hamiltonian into multiple instances of the same problem, though each instance is confined to a smaller Hilbert space. This reduction enables a polynomial-time algorithm when applied recursively. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our method, particularly concerning the minimum depth required for universal adiabatic quantum computers. Specifically, we examine the following question: Given a set of n qubits and m two-qubit gates, does there exist a circuit composed solely of these gates whose associated time-independent Hamiltonian is realizable? In other words, can it be represented by a Hermitian operator operating on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? If a solution exists, what is the smallest circuit size required? The answer to this question is contingent upon the particular framework used to describe the physical system in question. For instance, if in a case where each operation can have multiple excited states (i.e., is degenerate), a circuit would only be able to realize the specified Hamiltonian if it incorporates an infinite number of gates. Conversely, if every operation has precisely one excited state, there are different implications for circuit realizability.",

        "rewrite_text": "We conduct an analysis of the alignments between galaxy spins and tidal fields in actual data recovered from the Two Mass Redshift Survey (TMRS). We find that galaxies are preferentially aligned perpendicular to their tidal fields on scales larger than 1 Mpc/h. This alignment is more pronounced for galaxies observed at higher redshifts. The correlation between galaxy spin and tidal influence can be attributed to torques exerted by large-scale structures during the formation of these galaxies. Our results suggest that this mechanism plays a significant role in the angular momentum of galaxies. These discoveries have important implications for understanding how dark matter halos influence their surrounding environment, as well as for interpreting the statistics related to cosmic shear.\n\nIntroduction: Galaxies reside within overdense regions of the universe, where they interact strongly with other structures, including neighboring galaxies and cosmic filaments. During their formation, these interactions exert dynamic torques that affect the orientation of the galaxies' angular momentum vectors. The orientations of these angular momentum vectors subsequently determine the shapes of galaxies through dynamical friction. Therefore, it has been proposed that the observed orientations of galaxies can reveal insights into the dynamics of their angular momentum (e.g., Catelan & Theuns 1996; Lee et al. 2008). However, observational studies present conflicting results regarding whether there is a fundamental alignment of angular momentum axes with their cosmic environments (see e.g., Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 for recent works). To further understand the mechanisms that shape the distribution of galactic angular momentum, we analyze the properties of spin distributions over large volumes of the universe. Recent surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), provide sufficient data to accurately measure galaxy orientations. For instance, Lee et al. (2008) used SDSS DR4 data to explore the alignments between galaxy spins and their nearest neighboring structures, but they did not find significant evidence for such relationships.",

        "rewrite_text": "We theoretically investigate the influence of longitudinal magnetic fields in coronal loops on the damping rate of amplitude oscillations in solar prominences. Our analysis suggests that for sufficiently strong longitudinal magnetic fields, the damping is dominated by resonant absorption, which increases as the strength of the longitudinal magnetic field rises. Conversely, for weaker longitudinal magnetic fields, we find that the damping occurs due to interactions between Alfvén waves propagating along adjacent magnetic tubes. In this scenario, the damping decreases as the strength of the longitudinal magnetic field decreases. Our results are compared with observations made by the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) aboard the SOHO spacecraft. Since the late 1980s, it has been noted that many prominences exhibit transverse displacements observable in both Hα and EUV lines that extend high into the atmosphere. These oscillations have periods ranging from several minutes to about one minute, and their amplitudes typically exceed 100 km/s. Theoretical models suggest that these oscillations may be driven by magnetoacoustic waves trapped within the prominence or by fast kink modes excited by photospheric activity (see, e.g., Oliver & Ballester 1994; Terradas et al. 2002).

We find that there is no spontaneous breaking of parity (P) or time-reversal symmetry (T) for any value of the bare quark mass m0, provided that the number of flavors Nf exceeds 2. This finding suggests that the theories do not possess an effective parameter related to P and/or T, contrasting with what is typically expected in the standard model. Specifically, we find the spectrum comprises two degenerate Dirac fermion species corresponding to left-handed neutrinos and right-handed charged quarks, respectively. These fermions can be interpreted as mirror fermions, as they transform into one another under spatial reflection. The presence of these mirror fermions leads to intriguing implications, such as the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents mediated by gluons.\n\nChiral gauge theories play crucial roles both theoretically and phenomenologically. They provide a robust framework for understanding low-energy phenomena associated with hadrons.

The iron to hydrogen ratios we derived span from -2.3 dex to -1.9 dex, depending on the specific cluster analyzed. These results suggest that there may be no significant differences between the properties of the stellar populations within individual globular clusters and those found in the broader Galactic halo.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe properties of superfluid helium have been extensively studied since its discovery over fifty years ago. One of the most significant characteristics of superfluids is their ability to flow without dissipation or friction, leading to various applications, including in superconductors. Recently, ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have emerged as an additional platform for exploring quantum phenomena. These systems have been proposed as candidates for realizing Mott insulator phases, supersolid states, and even topological states. Moreover, they provide a means to tune interaction parameters and observe the effects of various interactions. This makes them ideal subjects for investigating theoretical concepts in depth.\n\nIn particular, bosonic atoms in optical lattices can be seen as forming a Bose-Einstein condensate, which behaves like a superfluid. Recent experiments have demonstrated superflow and vortex dynamics in these systems. However, unlike traditional superfluids, the condensates in optical lattices interact strongly with one another. Therefore, understanding how these interatomic interactions affect collective excitations is crucial. In this work, we focus on 1D Bose-Einstein condensates confined by an optical potential. By solving the relevant equations, we aim to shed light on these dynamics.",

In this study, we only include data that exceeds a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 sigma to create maps of molecular gas distributions. These maps reveal a significant difference between barred and unbarred spirals: while most barred spirals show strong concentrations of molecular gas along their bars, many unbarred spirals do not exhibit this feature. This finding suggests that the presence or absence of a bar may play a crucial role in shaping the molecular gas structures in galactic disks. It also indicates that the formation processes of bars may differ from those of bulges.

Our findings are compared to unpublished data from cosmological N-body simulations that incorporate both baryonic matter and collisionless dark matter interactions. Our key conclusions are: 1) Galaxy clusters exhibit significant deviations from isotropic dynamical equilibrium; 2) These deviations can be accounted for by hypothesizing that the dark matter distribution has a radially biased velocity dispersion tensor; and 3) This hypothesis suggests that the dark matter halos surrounding individual galaxies have elliptical shapes but differing orientations relative to one another. Additionally, our analysis provides important constraints on the mass-to-light ratio for the said clusters. Using HST observations of four nearby galaxy clusters, we provide evidence indicating that the matter distribution exhibits a strong radial trend in its velocity dispersion tensor.",

The metric takes the form \\( ds^2 = -dt^2 + (1 + \\cosh^2 r) d\\theta^2 - r^2 dr^2 \\), where \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) are coordinates in the plane. This solution can be derived by applying a duality transformation to the well-known BTZ black holes, which are non-rotating. We demonstrate that this new solution satisfies the physical conditions at infinity. Notably, it represents a black hole located at \\( r + = \\sqrt{3}M \\), with \\( M \\) being the mass parameter from the original BTZ solution. Finally, we explore potential generalizations of our findings. \n\n**Introduction:** There have been numerous attempts to construct solutions to Einstein's equations related to rotating black holes. A particularly interesting class of such solutions was presented by Bañados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ), who showed how to derive a static black hole solution in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. The standout feature of these solutions is their asymptotic behavior; they describe black holes with event horizons that are completely characterized by global parameters such as mass and charge. However, while they are valuable for studying aspects of gravitational phenomena, these solutions do not provide direct insights into the spacetime properties near the black hole's core. It would be beneficial to extend them into more complex geometries that describe the internal characteristics of the black hole. One method of achieving this is to consider higher-dimensional generalizations of the BTZ solution. Alternatively, we can implement a duality transformation on known solutions. For example, starting with the Schwarzschild solution expressed in spherical coordinates, we could apply a suitable transformation and obtain another solution in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates.",

This technology could provide clean water for remote communities without the need for large-scale infrastructure investments. Additionally, it has potential applications in agriculture, where cost-effective irrigation can be achieved using solar-powered sprayers. The collected water can also serve as a fuel source when combined with electrolysis cells powered by renewable energy.

We determined that their observed redshifts can be separated into an extrinsic redshift caused by gravitational lensing from foreground objects and an intrinsic component correlated with the widths of the broad emission lines. This correlation suggests that the intrinsic redshift arises from Doppler shifts related to outflows or inflows of gas on scales similar to those of the broad-line region. The second sample includes low-luminosity quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. These quasars do not exhibit evidence of being gravitationally lensed but do show peculiar redshift characteristics.

The central idea behind this approach is that we consider not only finite subcomplexes but also their covering analogues—specifically, tenth coverings. We demonstrate how covering homology can be advantageous for analyzing properties of graphs, including amenability and hyperbolicity. Notably, we prove that if a graph contains infinitely many foxes, its first covering homology group vanishes. This result generalizes the classical theorem by Stallings regarding groups with infinitely many primes. Covering homology provides a fruitful framework for exploring connections in various mathematical contexts. Interestingly, it can be related to other concepts, such as equivariant homology (when our foxes belong to a particular northeast) or Red-fox Shipping K-theory.

We derive a general expression for the stress-energy tensor that accounts for perturbations, including its trace-free part, which we refer to as the \"Eisenhower\" component. The evolution equations are constructed by projecting the conservation laws onto a four-vector field. Notably, we find that the presence of anisotropic stress contributes an \"Eisenhower\" source term to the equations governing the dynamics of scalar modes. Furthermore, we explore how our framework can be applied to various cosmological scenarios, including inflationary models and the formation of dark matter halos. Over the past decade, cosmology has been transformed by precise measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations have provided us with valuable insights into the early universe and have enhanced our understanding of fundamental physics on very large scales. The standard model of cosmology posits the existence of various components, including cold dark matter (CDM), baryons, photons, and neutrinos, each of which evolves according to specific hydrodynamical equations. However, these equations are often challenging to solve analytically, even when simplifying assumptions are made, necessitating numerical simulations.

Introduction**\n\nThe study of galaxy clusters has significantly advanced our understanding of cosmology over recent years. Observations of galaxy clusters have provided critical evidence for the existence of non-baryonic dark matter. Today, galaxy clusters remain instrumental in exploring the formation of cosmic structure and offer important constraints on various cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant and the equation of state parameter \\( w \\). However, despite these successes, several fundamental questions regarding galaxy clusters remain unresolved. For instance, while current observational techniques enable accurate measurements of the total mass of galaxy clusters, they do not clearly delineate the contributions from individual galaxies and the diffuse matter that surrounds them. Additionally, although we can estimate the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster, it is unclear what proportion of this mass is linked to the galaxies themselves. Finally, even though we know that clusters host significant amounts of dark matter, it remains uncertain whether this matter is gravitationally bound to the cluster. To address these questions, we will analyze two distinct datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory, including the sample previously studied by Vikhlinin et al.",

The RFM operates as an ultra-thin reflector accelerated to high velocities by femtosecond laser pulses directed at an angle. We show that the interaction between the counter-propagating laser beams results in frequency shifts that are significantly altered due to the presence of the RFM compared to conditions without it. This phenomenon can be understood within the framework of nonlinear optics and classical electrodynamics. Our work demonstrates the potential for generating high-energy photons through collisions of laser beams in a vacuum. These results have important implications for future applications such as advanced imaging or x-ray sources based on tabletop experiments. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the interaction of high-intensity lasers with matter under extreme conditions. One significant research area focuses on phenomena associated with the interaction of lasers in vacuum environments, particularly where strong quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects dominate. For instance, the experimental observation of the emission of electrons and positrons from vacuum was recorded when intense laser pulses were directed onto thin foils. Additionally, the generation of high-energy photons and particle pairs in vacuum has been theoretically explored. In this letter, we report our experimental investigation of another intriguing phenomenon related to the interactions of lasers in vacuum—the relativistic tennis effect. This effect arises from the collision of two counter-propagating laser beams inside a vacuum chamber. When these beams collide, they produce new frequencies that correspond to higher energy levels. This occurrence is attributed to the coherent addition of the electric fields of both beams, leading to the formation of a standing wave pattern. Consequently, the intensity of the standing wave increases, resulting in the appearance of these new frequencies.

They have been studied extensively from both theoretical and observational perspectives. A vital aspect of their physics involves how objects behave as they approach them, particularly those that can be influenced by the black hole's gravitational pull. Recent studies have revealed fascinating dynamics that occur very close to the event horizon. For instance, when a charged particle falls into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, its trajectory is affected by the photon sphere. If the charge of the particle is sufficiently strong, it may ultimately fall into the black hole after emitting photons. Another interesting phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole, where the dynamics are similarly influenced by the presence of the photon sphere. Unlike the Reissner-Nordström case, however, the Kerr black hole can affect not only photons but also gravitons. The investigation of scalar fields outside black holes has become an important area of study. In particular, identifying the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs), which are the characteristic frequencies at...",

This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of scattering centers due to defects generated during the magnetization reversal process. Conversely, no such behavior was observed in the sample with d = 1, suggesting that this difference is linked to the presence of additional disorder in the crystal structure of the compound. \n\nKeywords: High-Tc Superconductor, Pulsed Magnetic Field, Relaxation Processes, Defects Formation, Magnetoresistance, Hall Effect.\n\nIntroduction: Recent research has focused on exploring relaxation phenomena in high-temperature superconductors when subjected to pulsed external magnetic fields.

Additionally, we implement a version of the proportional fairness criterion that takes into account both the current network conditions and user preferences. Moreover, our framework incorporates a mechanism that allows nodes to dynamically adjust their channel assignment based on the current network load. Extensive simulations conducted using the NS-2 simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework under various scenarios.

We find that tower structures do not exist when J1 = J2; however, they emerge when J1 > J2 and vanish at specific ratios of J1/J2. The transition between the ordered state and the disordered state belongs to the universality class of the three-state Potts model with first-order transitions. Additionally, we find that the ground states are degenerate on the square lattice when J1 = J2 or when J1 < J2. This indicates that the ground states can be non-degenerate, despite not being fully characterized. \n\nPrevious work by Wannier has noted that the ground states of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice exhibit infinite degeneracy. Nonetheless, this does not imply that all potential configurations can serve as ground states. For instance, the ground states of the one-dimensional model are unique, although their excitation spectrum is continuous. In contrast, the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet shows doubly degenerate ground states. Recently, research has focused on the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI), with numerical studies indicating that these ground states are infinitely degenerate on square lattices when J1 = J2 or J1 < J2. Conversely, the ground states on the honeycomb lattice have been shown to be unique. These findings imply that the ground states can potentially be non-degenerate, even though their exact nature remains unclear.\n\nIn this letter, we explore the ground states of the ANNNI model using Monte Carlo simulations. We confirm that the ground states exhibit infinite degeneracy on the square-lattice ANNNI models. We then investigate whether these ground states are indeed unique.

More than 50% of the IRAC-selected sources show variations greater than 0.1 magnitudes at 3.6 microns, and 80% show similar variations at 4.5 microns across repeated epochs. These findings align with previous studies that noted variability in optically selected quasars. However, we also find evidence suggesting that this variability may not solely arise from AGN activity but could be linked to other processes such as mergers or dynamics within the host galaxies themselves.",

Furthermore, it offers a viable dark matter candidate in the form of the lightest neutralino.

One major issue is that the MSSM does not explain why there are three generations of quarks and leptons with varying charges. Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) tackle this problem by suggesting that all particles, including those of the third generation, belong to multiplets of a higher symmetry group than SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1), thereby relating coupling constants and fermion mass matrices. Another limitation of the MSSM is its inability to account for the neutrino masses observed experimentally.

        "rewrite_text": "We explore the properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) situated in a lattice defined by a harmonic oscillator and subjected to a disordered external potential. We find that, for any given lattice site N, there is always a finite fraction of atoms localized at each site of the potential. While localization decreases as disorder increases, it remains significant even when the disorder becomes quite large compared to the interatomic interaction scales. This finding holds true in both one-dimensional and higher-dimensional systems. Specifically, we note that the critical disorder threshold above which all states become localized scales as \\(1/N\\) in 1D and \\(1/d\\) in 2D and 3D, where \\(d\\) denotes the spatial dimension. Our results provide a microscopic understanding relevant to experimental observations of ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Introduction: Recent advancements have enabled the creation of ultra-degenerate gases of bosons or fermions in periodic potentials. These systems can be theoretically described using the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model, which has been extensively investigated in the past decade. In this work, we focus on a system of bosons subjected to a disordered potential. Disorder leads to Anderson localization: eigenstates become exponentially localized around their initial positions once the disorder exceeds a certain threshold. Recent experiments have demonstrated that such systems can exhibit a transition between Bloch-like states and Wannier-Stark ladders. However, these experiments were limited to the weak disorder regime, where the potential strength \\(V_0\\) is much smaller than the hopping energy scale \\(J\\). Here, we examine how the introduction of strong disorder modifies the physics of such systems.",

Our findings indicate that phonon transmission is significantly affected at low frequencies due to the impedance mismatch at the interface. The transmission becomes increasingly pronounced as the thickness of the Ge layer decreases. Additionally, we observed that phonon transmission exhibits strong anisotropy with respect to the crystallographic angle. These findings suggest that it may be feasible to control specialized transport properties by engineering the structure of the epitaxial interface. Epitaxial interfaces play critical roles in the thermoelectric properties of materials, such as electrical conductivity, optical reflectivity, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. Previous studies, such as those by Santos on superlattices, have shown that the thermal conductance can vary significantly compared to bulk materials. In this research, we concentrate on phonons, as they play a dominant role in thermal conduction in solids. Phonon behavior at epitaxial interfaces has been extensively studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, these methods often fail to provide detailed insights into phonon transmission across the interface, as they do not account for atomic-scale interactions.

We introduce an efficient approach for learning GCRF parameters using gradient techniques on the log-likelihood objective function.

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are undirected graphical models that have been successfully applied to various sequential data problems (Sha & Pereira, 2003). In this work, we propose GCRFs as a generalization of CRFs, allowing us to represent arbitrary structures over complex data such as graphs or trees. The principal idea behind GCRFs is to introduce a set of latent variables to capture dependencies between different components of the input data. This approach enables us to efficiently compute the partition function, similar to standard CRFs, through dynamic programming techniques. Furthermore, GCRFs can be optimized using gradient-based methods analogous to those used for Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to two significant tasks: part-of-speech tagging and protein sequence classification.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS** The Standard Model (SM) effectively describes most of the available experimental data, but its validity has only been established up to energies around 1 TeV. Beyond this energy range, phenomena emerge that are not adequately captured by the SM. To address such effects, researchers typically consider extensions of the SM or models inspired by approaches beyond it. Effective theories offer a systematic method for incorporating corrections due to physics at energy scales that exceed the relevant energy scales of the model. This approach allows for the calculation of observables using perturbative techniques, even when the underlying physics cannot be fully described within standard quantum mechanics. This strategy proves valuable in scenarios where there is no fundamental theory available for the phenomena under consideration. One prominent example of a theory is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interactions. It predicts the existence of hadrons composed of quarks and gluons. However, because the typical separation between constituents inside a hadron is much smaller than the characteristic scale of QCD, the interactions can often be treated separately from the underlying framework. For instance, the production of light and heavy quarks in high-energy collisions can be calculated using perturbative methods. Conversely, the interactions among partons can be more complex.",

Evolutionary game theory has been widely applied over the last decade to study competition among different species or individuals vying for limited resources.

This method enables calculations in QCD beyond leading order without any approximations or assumptions regarding the kinematics of the processes involved. We illustrate its functionality by calculating the next-to-leading-order corrections to the cross-section of heavy quark production at hadron colliders. In this context, we will discuss how analytic control over parton showers can be achieved by viewing partons as fundamental degrees of freedom. This framework has recently been developed within the context of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). It provides an effective approach to resum large logarithms associated with collinear splittings into multiple emissions, thereby enhancing our understanding of soft physics. The fundamental principle of SCET is that physical observables can be effectively described using soft and/or collinear fields. These fields exhibit nontrivial behavior under boosts along certain directions. They facilitate the separation of hard interactions from soft emissions. Consequently, we can systematically factorize scattering amplitudes into universal functions that capture short-distance behavior and universal functions that encode information about the emission of soft gluons.",

This approach is substantiated by solving the Fokker-Planck equation for the propagator function, which can only be addressed analytically under specific constraints related to the memory kernel. We demonstrate that this challenge can be mitigated by applying a new class of stochastic propagators, allowing us to derive solutions even when the memory kernel lacks a clear functional dependence on time or other variables. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our findings in relation to various phenomena described by fractional calculus. \n\nRecent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the study of systems whose behavior cannot be adequately captured by traditional Markovian models. This is largely due to the observation that many systems exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by power law distributions, intermittency, and other typical signatures of non-Markovian processes. To address these challenges, the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism has been proposed as a suitable framework. Within this framework, a system evolves over time following deterministic laws, but transitions are made at random intervals between different states. These transitions can arise due to sudden interactions with various degrees of freedom, such as phonons, electrons, and photons. As demonstrated in prior research, the CTRW formalism offers a comprehensive description of non-Markovian systems, effectively encompassing both state-based models and fractional diffusion equations as special cases. Despite its remarkable versatility, the application of the CTRW formalism has not been fully realized.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the behavior of a system of interacting bosons in an optical lattice with random on-site potentials and nearest-neighbor hopping, utilizing exact diagonalization methods. Our findings reveal a transition between two distinct regimes as the level of disorder increases. In one regime (weak disorder), the system exhibits Anderson localization, while in another regime (strong disorder), it displays characteristics of a Bose glass. The critical point of this transition heavily depends on the filling fraction of bosons per site. For low filling fractions, the transition occurs at relatively moderate levels of disorder. However, for higher filling fractions, the emergence of Bose glass behavior only takes place when the disorder becomes very pronounced. This indicates that even weak disorder can significantly influence the nature of the quantum state, particularly when compared to other scales such as interaction strength or energy scales. Disorder plays a crucial role in shaping various properties of condensed matter systems. It has recently been shown to give rise to intriguing phenomena like quantum Hall effects, insulator-to-superconductor transitions, and more. One of the most thoroughly studied models that explores both disorder and interactions is the Anderson model, which initially describes non-interacting electrons in a disordered potential. Although the original model focused on non-interacting particles, it has been extended to examine interacting systems across various dimensions. Furthermore, ultracold atoms have emerged as excellent candidates for simulating quantum effects in disordered environments. These experiments provide exceptional control over the relevant parameters, allowing for investigations of complex physics that go beyond traditional condensed matter systems. Ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattices offer unique opportunities to explore the interplay between disorder and interactions, with recent studies demonstrating evidence of Anderson localization in these systems by analyzing transport properties.",

Our findings indicate that the presence of shear thinning leads to significant changes in the stress distribution across the contact area compared to traditional Newtonian models. Specifically, we observe that the magnitude of the dimensionless tangential stress increases in scenarios with strong shear thinning characteristics. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that shear thinning effects can substantially reduce the magnitude of the dimensionless tangential stresses at the center of the contact region.

Introduction \nAn intriguing aspect of higher-dimensional theories is their capacity to incorporate gravity into the fundamental framework of nature. This has sparked increased interest in the study of brane-world scenarios that exhibit supersymmetry. One such class of spacetimes is characterized by warped geometries, defined by the metric \n\\[ ds^2 = e^{2A(y)} (\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu + dy^2), \\]\nwhere \\( y \\) denotes the coordinate along the brane, \\( A(y) \\) represents the warp factor, and \\( \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} \\) is the Minkowski metric. In the five-dimensional case, this corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum model. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of a nontrivial warp factor leads to significant changes in the physics of fields propagating in the bulk. These effects include modifications to the standard dispersion relations, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and fermion localization, among others. The nature of the effects due to the warp factor is critically dependent on its behavior near the boundary of the brane. If the warp factor decays sufficiently rapidly at infinity, all AdS observables will align with those derived from a standard flat-space defect. Conversely, if the warp factor does not diminish quickly enough, some novel phenomena arise.",

For example, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum J = N /2 (N being the number of atoms)  5  .\nIn fact, the Dicke model was originally proposed more than half century ago  6  . Since then various theoretical approaches have been developed to solve it  7 -10  . Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation  11  which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system  12  . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states  13  . Recently, several authors  14 -19  have tried to overcome this difficulty by introducing new transformations or approximations. Nevertheless, their solutions still suffer from certain drawbacks  20, 21  .",

We utilized cosmological simulations to examine how BH mass correlates with galaxy properties across various merger histories. Our findings indicate that mergers can significantly impact these relationships by introducing scatter at fixed luminosities or affecting the dispersion of galaxy properties. This is particularly pronounced in low-mass galaxies undergoing vigorous star formation. Additionally, we discovered that mergers lead to an increase in the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio, as well as an increase in the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the sampled galaxies. These results align with observations of AGN host galaxies. Ultimately, our research suggests that the observed correlation between supermassive BH masses and bulge properties may be driven primarily by the fact that both grow during major mergers.

This suggests that AGNs are not preferentially associated with either red or blue galaxies, contrary to previous assumptions; instead, they appear to be more prevalent among galaxies with intermediate colors. The absence of a correlation between galaxy color and AGN activity indicates that AGNs may have a limited role in suppressing star formation in blue galaxies. Alternatively, it could imply that AGNs exert varying effects depending on their luminosity and/or accretion rate.

However, its applications have typically been restricted to large, cumbersome devices that are not practical for field use. In this study, we present a method for continuous magnetophoresis-based blood cell sorting utilizing microfluidics. We demonstrate the effective isolation of red blood cells (RBCs) from whole blood by employing a magnetic gradient across a microchannel containing RBCs suspended in a buffer solution. Our findings indicate that this approach can serve as a reliable method for separating various types of blood cells with high purity and efficiency. This research has significant implications for developing portable diagnostic tools based on microscale blood analysis. Magnetic manipulation is essential in multiple fields, including medicine, biotechnology, environmental science, and industry. However, existing systems often consist of bulky equipment, making them unsuitable for use outside laboratory settings. Recently, there has been an increased focus on miniaturizing these systems into lab-on-a-chip formats, integrating functionalities such as sample preparation, analysis, delivery, and bioassays onto a single chip. Notably, magnetic separators have garnered interest due to their low cost, portability, and compatibility with other microfabricated components. Several studies have demonstrated the use of magnetic force for cell manipulation within microchannels or on planar surfaces. Despite these advancements, current methods still face challenges. They often rely on specific operating conditions that limit throughput and necessitate large sample volumes. Additionally, existing techniques typically allow for the separation of only two cell populations at a time, making it difficult to process more complex mixtures. The fabrication of these devices can also be complicated and may require intricate multi-step processes, while most studies have been conducted under static conditions, which restricts design flexibility.",

We determined that this burst is consistent with originating from off-axis, with an angle θ ~ 60° relative to its line of sight. The observed features can be explained by two components: (1) a bright pulse that occurred during the prompt emission, with a duration of T90 = 1 s and a fluence of Fγ = 2×10−6 erg cm−2; (2) an extended emission lasting several hundred seconds after the prompt phase, which accounts for about half of the total energy radiated by the source. Through detailed modeling, we find that both features can be adequately reproduced if the burst occurred within a dense environment surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. Notably, we illustrate how the density of such an environment leads to a double-peaked structure in the time-integrated spectrum of the burst.",

Additionally, we find systematic offsets among some of the estimators, which may be attributed to stylistic differences or calibration uncertainties.

This behavior is modeled using a harmonic term related to the local fluctuating curvature. We find that this model exhibits three distinct phases depending on temperature (T). At high temperatures (T > Tc), the system behaves like a liquid; at low temperatures (T < Ts), it transitions into a stable pulse-like state where all triangles are equilateral. For temperatures in between (Ts < T < Tc), we observe a disordered glassy state characterized by a fractal dimension D = 2 - H ≈ 1.7 ± 0.1. This finding is consistent with recent simulations conducted by other researchers. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence for a phase transition between the ordered and disordered states. Finally, we explore the implications of our findings for the development of more realistic models of biomembranes.",

Furthermore, we provide evidence for a substantial depletion of carbon onto grains, even at high metallicities like Z = 1/10,000 solar.

        "rewrite_text": "We propose using Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR) for linear models with non-negative outcomes. FSR is an iterative method that sequentially adds one variable at a time until a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied. We demonstrate how FSR can be effectively combined with the monotone Lasso penalty to enhance variable selection, allowing it to retain all relevant predictors while ensuring their significance remains intact. The resulting approach has a similar computational complexity to standard Lasso regression but yields better recovery of coefficients on both simulated datasets and real-world examples compared to traditional analyses of microarray data.\n\nForward Stagewise Regression (FSR), introduced by Frank & Friedman, operates through an iterative process where in each iteration a variable is added to the existing set of selected features based on its contribution to the objective function. This process continues until it meets a stopping criterion, like reaching a specified number of iterations or achieving a certain level of accuracy. In this study, we concentrate on applying FSR within the framework of linear models with non-negative outcomes. \n\nFor example, if our objective is to identify variables linked to risk factors, it would be logical to focus solely on those predictors that have been shown to increase risk, rather than those that might reduce it. A key advantage of FSR over other variable selection methods, such as stepwise regression, is that it does not rely on any prior parameters for selection. However, FSR does have two significant drawbacks when applied in scenarios with many potential covariates: 1) It may require numerous iterations before the solution converges; 2) There is no guarantee that the final model will include all relevant predictors.\n\nTo tackle these issues, Tibshirani et al. proposed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which addresses the following optimization problem:",

The SSAs are analyzed as functions of various kinematic variables, including transverse momentum, rapidity, azimuthal angle between the jets, and event centrality. Our findings indicate no dependence of the asymmetry on any kinematic variable, except for a decrease in the magnitude of the asymmetry with increasing rapidity. We compare our results with theoretical predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations that incorporate higher-order corrections and uncertainties in parton distribution functions. The results are consistent within the reported experimental and theoretical uncertainties, making this the most precise measurement of this observable to date.\n\nSingle transverse spin asymmetries have been identified in various experiments involving polarized protons and neutrons, including studies of inclusive pion production, semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan lepton pair production, prompt photon production, and direct photons. These measurements provide crucial insights into the spin structure of nucleons. Specifically, they can test the validity of factorization theorems that connect hard scattering cross sections to partonic distributions within protons. Furthermore, these observables offer avenues to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent suggestions have indicated that large transverse spin asymmetries might arise from the interference of two amplitudes involving different helicities of quarks, mediated by longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy collisions. Such effects challenge parity conservation and provide potential evidence for new physics. However, there has only been one prior measurement of transverse spin asymmetries in hadronic dijet production at high energies, conducted at RHIC, where the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision is notably lower at √sNN = 200 GeV.",

Theories involving adjoint matter fields can be retrieved as limiting cases by taking appropriate limits. This research was partially supported by NSF grant PHY-0456735. Since its introduction over thirty years ago, supersymmetry (SUSY) has played a significant role in many aspects of the Standard Model. It offers an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the Planck scale, while also providing insights into gauge coupling unification. In recent years, it has become clear that SUSY must be broken to align with experimental results. However, despite extensive efforts over several decades, a fully satisfactory framework for spontaneous SUSY breaking has yet to be established. One promising approach involves using supergravity to generate soft terms that can lead to SUSY breaking. Another avenue is to explore higher-dimensional theories where SUSY is either softly broken or spontaneously broken via boundary conditions. Additionally, there is ongoing research into models based on local symmetries, such as gauged or global SUSY.",

This framework allows us to investigate how decoherence impacts the system over extended timescales. Notably, it offers insights into the spectrum of system operators related to the off-diagonal elements of the density tensor, as well as the stationary states attained in the long-time limit. As an example, we apply our formalism to explore the dissipative spin-boson model with Ohmic dissipation, comparing the results against simulations derived from the Quantum Monte Carlo Wavefunction method.\n\n**I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK**\n\nUnderstanding the behavior of macroscopic systems under the influence of their environments has been a fundamental question in physics since its inception. This issue becomes increasingly complex when considering many-body systems such as those found in condensed matter and quantum field theories, where the number of degrees of freedom can be quite large. A powerful strategy for addressing these challenges involves studying the state of the system conditioned on specific measurements made on its environmental degrees of freedom. In recent years, there have been multiple efforts aimed at establishing efficient frameworks to describe the dynamics of these systems. Among these, the Hierarchy of Density Matrices (HDM) has emerged as a promising alternative due to its capacity to account for non-Markovian effects. Nevertheless, while the HDM can provide accurate descriptions of finite-time evolutions, it struggles to correctly capture the asymptotic behavior of systems. To address this issue, we present a modified formulation of the HDM, leading to the recovered Hierarchy of Density Tensors.",

The line profiles show significant changes during outbursts, where the mass accretion rate increases by several magnitudes compared to quiescent states. Additionally, we observed absorption features at redshifted velocities in some cases, suggesting the presence of a third body or mass inflow into the disk. These observations provide critical constraints for theoretical models of CV evolution.\n\nKeywords: Accretion Disk, Double-Peaked Emission Lines, White Dwarf, Cataclysmic Variables\n\n1. Introduction  \nCataclysmic Variables (CVs), often referred to as dwarf novae, are binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a late-type star filling its Roche lobe. Mass is transferred through the Lagrangian point L1 onto the surface of the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk around the compact star. This process leads to outbursts that occur due to thermal instabilities in the accretion disk, resulting in fluctuations in luminosity over time scales ranging from hours to several days. During these outbursts, the accretion rate surges by several orders of magnitude, causing strong emissions and high temperatures in the outer regions of the disk, while the light from the system may diminish due to obscuration effects. The variety of CVs offers valuable insights into accretion dynamics, magnetic fields, and angular momentum transport. Moreover, CVs can serve as distance indicators and probes of galactic structure. \n\n2. Observations & Data Reduction  \nOur sample comprises nine CVs, which were observed between 2004 and 2007 using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) mounted on the 10-meter Keck I telescope located on Mauna Kea.",

We find that these models are not sufficiently robust for our purposes because they do not account for all essential factors, such as convection, in their frameworks. This shortcoming leads to errors when using them for photometric calibration or the derivation of distances. We illustrate how we can enhance the reliability of different synthetic models by incorporating observations of stars with varying ages and metallicities, which helps to bridge the gap between predicted and observed properties in star clusters and galaxies. Furthermore, we discuss potential improvements for the current synthetic libraries. Upcoming data from space-based telescopes will provide unprecedented insights into our Galaxy, and these extensive datasets need to be analyzed thoroughly. A crucial aspect is the calibration of photometric measurements from Gaia and LSST, which will offer precise astrometry and multi-color photometry for billions of stars across the sky. To ensure high accuracy, it is essential to identify potential sources of noise and biases during the calibration process. Specifically, it is vital to ensure that the derived absolute magnitudes \\(M_V\\) are accurate within 0.01 magnitudes across most color ranges explored by the survey. For instance, if the distance modulus is given by \\(DM = 5 \\log_{10}(d/d_{\\text{sun}})\\), where \\(d\\) is the actual distance to the star and \\(d_{\\text{sun}}\\) is the Sun’s distance from Earth, then a 0.01 magnitude difference corresponds to a distance factor of 1.1. Consequently, even small uncertainties in the absolute magnitude can lead to significant errors in the inferred distances. Therefore, it is crucial to have reliable models to determine the absolute magnitudes of individual stars accurately before making further derivations. Currently, several methods exist to estimate absolute magnitudes based on stellar atmospheric models. However, these models often struggle to meet observational constraints at low temperatures and high surface gravities, resulting in derived magnitudes that can be inconsistent with values obtained through other methods, such as those from eclipsing binaries. Additionally, some of these models suffer from incomplete physics, which further complicates their application.",

We find that the dependence on the spin parameter is weak when the photon emission region is small relative to the radius at which photons decouple from matter. However, for larger emission regions, the influence of the spin parameter becomes significant, particularly for prograde spins. Our results can be used to estimate the impact of relativistic Doppler boosting and gravitational lensing on observed spectra, providing valuable insights for models of X-ray reflection spectroscopy. \n\nAccreting black holes emit bright spectral lines in their X-ray spectrum due to the reprocessing of radiation from nearby X-ray sources by colder material orbiting close to the black hole's equatorial plane. This phenomenon has been extensively studied both observationally and theoretically (see Reynolds & Nowak 2003; Done et al. 2004). Notably, the strong redshifts observed indicate that the emitting material is moving rapidly around the black hole. This rapid motion causes pronounced shifts in the spectrum due to relativistic Doppler effects and gravitational lensing. Such relativistic effects become more pronounced if the emitting region possesses a high rate of rotational velocity or is nearly face-on. Therefore, it is crucial to account for these effects when interpreting observations of such systems.\n\nIn this work, we focus on situations where the illuminating source is located above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Examples of these sources include magnetic flares occurring within the disk or active regions associated with the disk’s dynamic processes. We assume that the disk is optically thick, resulting in all radiation being reprocessed locally. We utilize Monte Carlo simulations to model the emergent radiation from the disk, taking into account the geometrical configuration of the system. The primary goal of our study was to develop simple analytical expressions describing how the shape of the emission lines depends on the properties of the system. To achieve this, we conducted numerical calculations across a broad parameter space.",

The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today.

Our observations reveal that when one electron passes through the drilled aperture while its entangled partner travels along a nearby path outside the aperture, they exhibit destructive interference at the detector located behind the aperture. This destructive interference can be explained by the distinct phase shifts acquired due to their differing paths. Our findings illustrate how quantum mechanical effects are observed in practical scenarios, analogous to those seen in optical systems. Quantum mechanics predicts that such nonlocal correlations will persist even when the entangled particles are spatially separated. Specifically, this suggests that the quantum state of one electron can be correlated with that of another, regardless of their distance apart. While nonlocality has been demonstrated with photons, it has not yet been observed with fermions like electrons or atoms.

Our findings indicate that the derived ages are generally consistent within their uncertainties; however, there is some evidence of discrepancies when comparing these ages to the true cluster ages. This discrepancy may arise from the fact that we have used only one rotation period per star, which does not take into account any variability or scatter in the rotation periods observed among coeval stars. The results outlined here suggest that this technique can offer valuable constraints on stellar ages if applied with careful consideration of all sources of uncertainty. \n\n**Keywords:** Age estimation, Open clusters, Rotation periods, Gyrochronology.  \n\n**1 Introduction**  \nStellar ages are crucial in many fields of astrophysics, including galactic archaeology and exoplanet science. Specifically, accurate age estimates for stars are vital to understanding how planets form and evolve over time. However, determining precise ages for individual stars is challenging due to the wide range of masses and luminosities they exhibit, alongside their complex evolutionary histories. While main-sequence turn-off ages can be estimated accurately using photometric methods such as isochrones in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), these techniques become less effective beyond the red giant branch, where convection significantly disrupts the analysis. While asteroseismic measurements allow us to probe the interiors of evolved stars, the intricacy of the resulting data necessitates detailed modeling of the dynamics and evolution of each star individually. Thus, alternative methods must be explored to determine ages for large samples of stars across a range of characteristics. Gyrochronology presents an alternative approach for estimating ages based on the spin-down rate of magnetic activity generated by dynamo processes at the base of the solar convective zone (Barnes 2003). It has been shown that the Rossby number \\( R_o \\), defined as the ratio between the stellar rotation period \\( P_{rot} \\) and the convective overturning timescale, plays a significant role in this process.",

However, due to limited bandwidth resources available in WLANs, efficient resource management becomes crucially important  2  .\nThe most widely used medium access control protocol in current commercial WLAN products is the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which provides both contention-based channel access mechanism called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)  3  , and contention-free service via Point Coordinated Function (PCF)  4  . Although CSMA/CA allows multiple stations to share the same radio channel simultaneously without any centralized coordination, it suffers from poor system performance when the traffic load increases  5  . This problem is mainly caused by the hidden terminal effect  6  where two nodes may transmit packets to one another simultaneously causing collisions. To alleviate these problems, several approaches have been proposed  7 -10  .

An optimized Tersoff potential was used to model the SWCNTs, and we simulated three distinct types with diameters of 1 nm, 2 nm, and 3 nm across a temperature range of 300 K to 1500 K. Our results indicate that Young's modulus decreases as the temperature increases, while the tensile stress remains relatively constant up to 1000 K but begins to decline beyond this threshold. This behavior is attributed to the fluctuations that lead to structural defects, resulting in a reduction in material strength.

Their unique properties confer exceptional mechanical and electrical characteristics, such as high elasticity and extraordinary thermal and electrical conductivity, making them prime candidates for various applications. Carbon nanotubes can be classified based on their diameter or chirality, leading to diverse family structures. Generally, they can be categorized into two types: zigzag and armchair tubes. Zigzag tubes have alternating double bonds along their edges, while armchair tubes feature only single bonds. A third type, known as chiral tubes, exhibits properties that lie between zigzag and armchair configurations. These tubes are defined by a pair of integers (n, m), where n represents the number of hexagons around the circumference and m indicates the number along the longitudinal direction.

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate how the behavior of the Carter constant is influenced by the spin and mass ratio in binary systems with rotating black holes, utilizing numerical relativity simulations. Our findings indicate that the behavior is weak when the spins are aligned or antialigned, but becomes stronger when there is a significant angle between them. This suggests that it may be possible to infer the quadrupole moment of black holes by observing their gravitational wave signals during the late stages of inspiral. Such observations could reveal valuable information about the spacetime geometry near the horizons of the black holes, which could be further explored.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this study, we examine how the behavior of the Carter constant is dependent on the spins and mass ratios in binary systems of rotating black holes. The Carter constant is one of several conserved quantities associated with geodesics around Kerr black holes (Carter 1968) and can provide insights into the spacetime geometry close to the event horizons, as it changes only if there is a deviation from axisymmetry at small radii (Bardeen 1973; Thorne et al. 1986). In systems where an accretion disk is present, the Carter constant may vary, even though the total angular momentum of the system remains constant (Kerr 1963). Previous studies have shown that the orbital dynamics of binaries with non-spinning components are influenced by the black hole's quadrupole moment, represented by \\( Q = M (1 - S^2) / c^2 R^2 \\), where \\( S \\) is the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar 1999). However, these effects become negligible when the black holes are in the process of merging due to rapid orbital decay caused by gravitational wave emission. Additionally, observations suggest that many galaxies host supermassive black holes with masses reaching up to \\( 10^9 \\) solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al. 2000). It is believed that these systems evolve through multiple phases of mass transfer before reaching their final coalescent state. During these significant interactions, the black holes may experience substantial tidal influences and other dynamics.",

The device consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer, allowing for the manipulation of DWs between various positions in each magnetic layer using spin-transfer torques and electric fields. We assert that this type of device can operate at lower current densities compared to traditional spin valves, which typically have higher magnetoresistance. Additionally, we demonstrate how the energy barrier associated with the movement of the DWs can be adjusted by varying the thickness of both ferromagnetic layers and the non-magnetic spacer. This flexibility enables us to optimize the energy landscape, ensuring that the DWs remain stable in their equilibrium positions when no external forces or voltages are applied. Finally, we explore potential applications of our proposed device in the evolving field of spintronics, which has gained traction as one of the most promising areas for advanced technological innovations. One of the key challenges facing these devices is finding efficient methods to control the flow of charge carriers without sacrificing their high mobility. To address this issue, several researchers have recently investigated the manipulation of electron transport through various magnetic textures, including vortex states, skyrmions, and domain walls. Domain walls are particularly intriguing because they can be controlled both electrically and thermally, making them ideal candidates for low-power devices. However, despite significant progress in understanding the physics behind the dynamics of domain walls, there remains uncertainty regarding the precise mechanisms for driving their movement.",

Our findings indicate that the volume fraction increases with applied stress under all conditions studied. The increase in volume fraction during unloading is less pronounced than that during the loading phase. This hysteresis effect becomes more significant as the amount of unloading increases. Additionally, we observe changes in the contact force distribution across different stages of the process. These findings are discussed in the context of elastic-plastic models of granular materials. Granular matter is ubiquitous in nature and underlies various geological phenomena such as avalanches, landslides, mudflows, sedimentation, soil mechanics, and earthquakes. It plays a crucial role in diverse fields including metallurgy, construction, and agriculture. Despite its prevalence, there are still unresolved questions regarding the mechanical behavior of granular materials. Research has been ongoing to enhance our understanding of how granular substances respond to mechanical loads. One intriguing question is how a sample of sand behaves when compressed and subsequently released. The work presented here aims to explore these issues through numerical simulations.

This approach accounts for both elastic scattering off quarks and inelastic processes, such as dissociation into open charm or bottom hadrons. Our findings suggest that the observed suppression pattern can be accurately described by elastic processes for transverse momenta (pT) below 2 GeV, while inelastic processes become necessary to explain data points with higher pT. Notably, the contributions of these inelastic effects, such as dissociation into heavier flavor mesons, are essential to account for the nuclear modification factor RAA (pT), in contrast to calculations based solely on elastic processes. \n\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Mh, 25.75.-q, 11.10.Kk \n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nThe measurement of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium production serves as a valuable means to explore the properties of the hot and dense matter generated in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. It has been proposed that interactions between quarkonia and the surrounding medium can lead to their partial melting, resulting in a decrease in bound state masses due to color screening. In this work, we employ an effective field theory framework, where the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons rather than individual hadronic states. This allows us to express the total cross sections for quarkonium production in terms of elementary partonic subprocesses involving quarks (u, d, s) and gluons (g). Our analysis includes elastic scattering from quarks and gluon-gluon interactions leading to the formation of quarkonia through the creation of a virtual quark-antiquark pair. Additionally, we examine inelastic processes such as quarkonium dissociation into heavy flavor hadrons.",

Our findings indicate that these correlation functions can be aptly described by an exponential form characterized by a length scale that increases as the temperature approaches the glass transition point. This increase aligns with predictions based on Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT), although we observe notable deviations from MCT near the glass transition temperature, Tg. These deviations arise from the dynamic heterogeneities present in this regime. The data we provide offer valuable insights into the nature of spatio-temporal fluctuations in glassy systems. Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow relaxation processes across a range of time scales, displaying non-exponential relaxations, aging effects, and other phenomena characteristic of glassy behavior. Theoretical frameworks, such as MCT, have been established to describe these phenomena; however, questions remain regarding MCT's applicability to real systems. A significant concern is the influence of spatial correlations among local regions, which interact with each other, exhibiting varied dynamics. Such correlations stem from cooperative rearrangements and/or dynamic heterogeneity. Recent theoretical work has highlighted the critical role of spatial correlations in shaping the guess function, Fs(q, t), where q is the wavevector corresponding to the probed length scale, and t is the lag time used in measuring Fs(q, t). To determine whether MCT fully captures the relevant physics, it is essential to experimentally examine the spatial correlations described by this function. Previous studies have largely focused on temporal correlations; however, recent investigations have begun to explore spatial correlations more comprehensively.",

In this study, we believe that the authors are incorrect in claiming an upper limit on the mass of the electron, as they failed to account for all relevant background processes. We would like to briefly discuss their handling of backgrounds and their application of cuts to select events. A significant source of background arises from radiative Bhabha scattering, described by the process \\( e^+ e^- \\rightarrow e^+ e^- \\gamma \\), which has been extensively studied at LEP2. It was found that this background is negligible compared to other sources, such as two-photon processes or four-fermion states (e.g., \\( W \\) pair production). This background can only become significant if only one photon is detected; however, since photons are collinear with the electrons and positrons, the probability of missing both photons is extremely low. Additionally, the likelihood of this scenario decreases rapidly as the invariant mass of the lepton pairs increases. The authors impose a cut on the total visible energy of the event, \\( E_{\\text{vis}} > 10 \\) GeV, which excludes most of these events. They acknowledge that there may still be some contribution from radiative Bhabhas but argue that this can be mitigated by requiring the presence of additional jets. However, although the jet multiplicity does decrease slightly after applying this cut, the reduction is insufficient to justify the loss of signal efficiency caused by excluding events with lower jet energies. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the contributions from radiative Bhabhas should be included in the systematic uncertainty estimate; however, this assertion is misleading, as the actual contributions to the uncertainty arise from various sources and are tied to the modeling of initial-state radiation. Lastly, we note that the authors rely on Monte Carlo simulations conducted with PYTHIA, which is known to underestimate the number of high-multiplicity events.",

        "rewrite_text": "We expanded our understanding of the glassy behavior of a system composed of adhesive microspheres, which exhibit a repulsive inter-particle force that decays with distance as 1/r^6. We identified two distinct dynamical modes in this system at low temperatures: one is a fast mode associated with rearrangements in a strongly bonded region, while the other is a slower mode linked to collective behavior among the particles. The behavior of this glassy system can be effectively described by mode-coupling theory (MCT) for colloidal suspensions. However, we found that standard MCT does not align well with our experimental data because it overlooks the effects of strong interactions that introduce additional relaxation mechanisms. By implementing a modified version of MCT, we achieved a better agreement with our observations across a range of time scales. This revised MCT framework accurately predicts the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time near the glass transition temperature (Tg). Our findings demonstrate how rigorous testing of theoretical models can enhance their accuracy and applicability in understanding glassy dynamics.",

Our aim was to determine if any of these planets might be false positives due to blending with nearby stars or other effects, such as eclipses from background objects. Many of the planetary detections have been made using ground-based telescopes, which struggle to resolve individual sources in crowded fields. Consequently, it is feasible that some of the observed signals could originate from multiple unresolved stars rather than from actual planets.

        "rewrite_text": "We introduce the concept of a preservation of an \"Watch\" within a monoidal category and demonstrate that it corresponds to the IDF of a coalgebra in the dual category, which we refer to as a comonoid. We then define the cyclic homology of such algebras as the Hochschild cohomology of their underlying comonoids, framed within the bimodule presentations generated by the tensor product of the comonoid with its opposite. This framework generalizes the conventional definitions applicable to ordinary algebras over fields or rings. Notably, if the base ring has Lie zero, this recovers the classical stationary definition of cyclic homology and related cyclic concepts. The same construction can also be applied to Hopf algebroids instead of ordinary algebras; however, there are certain subtleties involved when trying to extend these results to noncommutative rings. Finally, we provide several examples to illustrate our constructions. Cyclic homology was introduced by Connes in his groundbreaking work on noncommutative geometry. It can be viewed as the Hochschild homology of specific algebras with a cyclic structure. These were first systematically investigated by Bökstedt, who demonstrated how they could be utilized to construct various homological structures, including crossed modules. Since then, numerous authors have explored different aspects of cyclic homology and its applications. For further reading, see works by Fri1, Fri2, Koc, Lau, Maz, Nee, and Sta. In this article, we will delve into cyclic homology in greater detail, utilizing the developments recently made in the theory of operads and monads. Our main result indicates that any cyclic structure gives rise to two distinct types of cyclic homologies: the cyclic homology of the underlying algebra and the tenets of cyclic homology of the associated graded algebra. Furthermore, both of these can be computed explicitly in terms of the defined maps characterizing the cyclic structure. As a result, we derive explicit formulas for the cyclic homology of all finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras over a ring with characteristic zero.",

Subsequent research has extended this model to include multiple seeds, as well as various shapes of growth. This paper presents another generalization of the Eden model: instead of focusing on the growth of a single cluster, we explore the simultaneous growth of multiple clusters competing for available space.

(2) A bright knot appears on either side of the central source along the jet. (3) These knots exhibit blue-shifted emission lines compared to their surrounding environment. (4) The knots show a line width of approximately 100 km/s, while the compact source exhibits a line width of up to 300 km/s. These observations suggest that the knots represent regions of shock where the jet interacts with the surrounding material.

The CME's speed is estimated to be approximately 1450 km/s at a distance of 1 AU, based on STEREO observations. We suggest that this CME originated from an Evershed magnetic configuration characterized by two opposite-polarity sunspots connected by a filament channel. Additionally, we observed several temporary brightenings around the sunspots prior to the onset of the flare and CME activity. These brightenings are identified as ephemeral regions (ERs), which are known to play crucial roles in triggering eruptions like flares or CMEs. By analyzing high-resolution observations from Hinode/SOT/SP, we found that one of these ERs interacted significantly with the surrounding magnetic field lines during its rapid rotation. This interaction led to reconnection between the opposite magnetic fields, resulting in the formation of a current sheet beneath the ER.

        "rewrite_text": "We are investigating the engineering northeast function for the coupling constant of the AdS5 x S5 superstring, which is found to be proportional to the one-loop image. This suggests that there are no non-trivial fixed points at any finite value of the coupling constant. We discovered that the dilaton field has an imaginary component when considering higher-order terms beyond the leading approximation. This indicates that our findings may only be valid within a limited region of the parameter space where the imaginary part of the dilaton can be ignored. This work was inspired by the ongoing research on the gauge/gravity correspondence between N = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with 16 supercharges and type IIB string theory on AdS5 x S5. In this context, the existence of non-trivial fixed points corresponds to the conformal invariance of the dual SYM theory, while the imaginary component of the dilatonic scalar fields suggests an instability in the theory. Previous work has calculated the one-loop corrections for both the metric tensor and the dilaton using the Green-Schwarz formalism. They found that these corrections do not vanish even at zero coupling constants. However, their calculations assumed that all fermionic contributions vanish, which is not a valid assumption. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a more thorough analysis that takes into account the effects of fermions alongside those from the bosons.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes all known fundamental interactions except for gravity. It incorporates a single type of left-handed neutrinos whose masses are generated by the Higgs mechanism; however, it does not explain why these masses are so much smaller compared to those of other SM fermions. To address this issue, various extensions of the SM have been proposed. In particular, theories based on gauge groups larger than SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y predict the existence of states beyond those included in the SM. These additional states could encompass right-handed neutrinos or scalar fields. If such states exist at low energy scales, they might lead to observable effects. One approach to investigate whether new degrees of freedom exist below the electroweak scale is through precision measurements. Another method is to search for signs of new physics in rare processes. Lastly, if these new particles are produced at high-energy colliders, their properties can also be studied.",

In this study, we address the challenges posed by a large dataset that must be stored in memory, such as that of a database, consisting of various records that may vary significantly in size—some may even exceed available memory. A common solution to this issue is to use blocking techniques: each item is divided into blocks of uniform size, which are then organized contiguously within the allocated storage space.

Introduction\n\nConvolutional neural networks have become prominent in various computer vision applications. Recently, they have been adapted for different types of optimization tasks, including applications in confident estimation, semantic segmentation, and others. However, most existing research primarily concentrates on optimizing a single objective function. In many practical scenarios, multiple objective functions need to be considered. For instance, in robotic systems, it often requires finding collision-free paths while minimizing energy consumption; in autonomous driving, it must ensure safe trajectories under both kinematic and dynamic constraints simultaneously; in healthcare, it is essential to efficiently diagnose while providing recommendations; and in structural biology, optimizing protein folding and molecular design concurrently is crucial. Therefore, developing new methods to tackle multi-objective optimization challenges is imperative. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been employed to solve multi-objective optimization problems. This approach derives policies from raw data without the need for hand-engineered features.

Our findings challenge models that predict a softening of the photon spectrum as it transitions into the X-ray band, supporting scenarios where high-energy photons are produced from inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons accelerated in internal shocks.

We argue that this concept does not apply to numerous instances where it has been previously utilized. Specifically, we explain how the phenomenon of multisite phosphorylation can be integrated into our framework without requiring any additional parameters or complexities beyond those necessary for single-site phosphorylation. We also contend that rebinding effects are generally insignificant in most scenarios involving signaling cascades. The concept of allovalency was first introduced over 20 years ago, describing the concurrent binding of two or more ligands to multiple sites on a single protein. This phenomenon frequently occurs during signaling processes such as kinase cascades. The term \"allovalent\" was coined to characterize a situation that lies between monovalency and multivalency: each ligand binds only once at its site, but several copies of the same ligand can be bound simultaneously to the same molecular entity. Allovalent interactions have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, despite its broad acceptance, the precise definition of allovalency remains ambiguous. Some researchers define allovalency as the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands to different sites on a molecule, while others consider allovalency to involve independent yet cooperative ligand binding to multiple sites. Additionally, some definitions stipulate that allovalent complexes must involve at least three distinct ligands.",

However, fundamental questions about the nature of emergent phenomena remain unanswered. In recent years, several researchers have sought to tackle these challenges using concepts borrowed from thermodynamics, such as entropy and free energy. Initially developed within the realm of classical thermodynamics, these concepts have been adapted to the framework of quantum mechanics. For instance, the von Neumann entropy, defined as \\( S = -\\text{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho) \\), measures the uncertainty associated with measurement outcomes in a given quantum state. Its time derivative, \\( dS/dt \\), provides insights into the entropy production rate. This quantity plays a crucial role in characterizing irreversible behavior in various systems. Moreover, when the entropy production rate is zero, the system exhibits reversible dynamics, while a positive production rate indicates a non-equilibrium state.",

Additionally, the transmission coefficient increases with stress at low bias voltages but decreases at high bias voltages. This behavior can be interpreted as follows: at low bias voltages, the rise in the transmission coefficient is attributed to a reduction in barrier height caused by compressive stress. Conversely, at high bias voltages, the decrease in the transmission coefficient results from two factors: an increase in effective mass due to tensile stress and the enhancement of electron-phonon interactions also caused by tensile stress.

Additionally, we find that fluctuations in the total magnetic moment are minimized near the quantum phase transition point due to the emergence of singlet pairs.\n\nDOI: 10.1063/1.5015481\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\nThe discovery of Majorana fermions has generated significant interest in studying non-abelian anyons in condensed matter physics. Semiconductor nanowires present a promising platform for realizing such states, as they can host Majorana modes at their ends or as excitations localized to vortex cores. To experimentally validate these proposals, it is essential to consider the effects of disorder, electron-electron interactions, and other sources of decoherence on the stability of the Majorana state. Several theoretical studies have recently addressed various aspects of these issues. However, many critical questions remain regarding the interplay between the interactions that are essential for the realization of Majorana states in practical experimental systems. One key issue is how interactions affect the character of the ground state. It has been demonstrated that repulsive interactions tend to favor the formation of a spin-singlet state over a triplet state. Conversely, attractive interactions can lead to the formation of a spin-triplet state instead of a singlet state. These results highlight the complex behavior of these systems under different interaction conditions.",

We demonstrate that these phenomena can be analyzed by solving Maxwell's equations with suitable Green's function techniques. The derived expressions are utilized to explore the dispersion relationships for surface plasmons (SPs) and surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs). Notably, we find that SPs arise only when the real part of the dielectric constant is negative, whereas SPhPs can exist even when it is positive. Additionally, we compare our results to those derived from the classical Drude model and discuss the limitations of its applicability. Surface plasmons (SPs), which represent collective oscillations of conduction electrons at metal-dielectric interfaces, have been widely investigated in recent years due to their significance in various fields such as optics, electronics, and catalysis. Recently, there has been increased interest in surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs), analogous excitations related to longitudinal optical phonons. These modes not only manifest at surfaces but also propagate within certain bulk materials, where they can lead to enhanced transport phenomena or thermoelectric effects. Furthermore, SPhPs can strongly interact with novel materials, leading to intriguing phenomena such as superprism effects and enhanced transmission characteristics.",

The observations show blueshifted emission lines that indicate radial velocities ranging from -500 km/s to -1000 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. This outflow has been previously characterized using optical IFU data as well as HST observations. Additionally, we identify a second, slower outflow oriented perpendicular to the first one, extending across 3 kpc to the east. Both outflows are driven by nuclear activity originating from the central engine. By applying simple models of gas distribution and kinematics, we estimate mass inflow rates into the CNR to range from 0.1 solar masses per year to several solar masses per year.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate the interplay between thermal percolating states and background states in disordered systems using Monte Carlo simulations of dimers adsorbing onto binary surfaces with varying compositions. We find that there exists an optimal composition where both types of states coexist, leading to a peak in background entropy. This coexistence has also been observed experimentally. Our findings provide valuable insights into how instability can enhance background states through percolating networks. Energy efficiency plays a crucial role in many background processes, such as Duck conduction, Jarvis networks, and Lies transport. Specifically, it affects whether a system will reach equilibrium. In this study, we focus on a specific type of non-equilibrium thermal percolation. Thermal percolation occurs when particles are introduced into a system. These particles then diffuse and interact until they collide with one another. When two particles meet, their energies combine irreversibly, resulting in a cascade-like spread of density. As more particles are added, the likelihood of interactions increases. Eventually, these particles merge to form a Jarvis cluster that spans the entire system. At this stage, all particles have coalesced into a giant cluster. Recent research has shown that the transition from a sparse, disconnected cluster to a larger connected cluster depends on background stability. For networks, particularly in the case of random resistor networks, the critical temperature T depends solely on the average resistance R_av, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. However, if the distribution of resistances P(R) is broad enough, the system becomes unstable.",

The particles can be manipulated along a path that connects them through electrostatic fields generated by external electrodes in the trapping chamber. We demonstrate that this setup allows us to control the collision rate and their interaction parameters. This arrangement paves the way for investigating fundamental processes such as elastic scattering or charge exchange. Furthermore, we explore how to leverage this configuration to realize entanglement between two trapped atoms through a shared interaction mediated by a common gate. Quantum protocols require scalable architectures based on multiple qubits. One promising avenue for developing such devices involves using neutral atoms stored in optical lattices; however, this approach faces challenges due to limited coherence times attributed to spontaneous emission. An alternative strategy is storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped ions, though these also experience significant decoherence issues due to heating. To address these challenges, hybrid approaches have been proposed that combine elements from both strategies. In this context, the storage of quantum states takes place in a well-defined manner, while a large number of neutral atoms act as flying qubits. A crucial aspect of implementing these schemes is the ability to achieve high-fidelity entanglement between both types of qubits. Recent experimental results have shown the feasibility of entangling two neutral atoms via a shared interaction. However, to achieve this goal, the atoms must be precisely aligned with one another before being released into free space.",

These properties include high reflectance, coupled refraction, and nonlinear optical responses, making them promising candidates for various applications, such as optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics. Recent studies have illustrated that multilayers comprising anisotropic layers can give rise to intriguing electromagnetic phenomena, particularly slow wave resonance (SWR). This phenomenon is observed when the group velocity of the Bloch waves approaches zero within certain layers, leading to the emergence of a large effective refractive index, \\( n_{\\text{eff}} = c / v_{\\text{ph}} \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \\( v_{\\text{ph}} \\) is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave.

The source was monitored in the 20-100 keV energy range for approximately 100 days, starting around MJD 53000 and concluding at MJD 53300. Our analysis utilized data from both ISGRI and SPI instruments aboard the INTEGRAL satellite. In addition to the typical spectral shape described by a power law followed by an exponential cutoff, we identified two distinct features in the spectrum. One of these has been previously noted by other researchers, although its significance remains debated. The second feature emerges only when analyzing the complete dataset with all three models considered: power law plus exponential cutoff, a simple power law, or a Comptonization model. This feature could either represent a reflection hump produced by cold material surrounding the central X-ray source or a broad iron line at approximately 6.4 keV.",

Our findings indicate that most of these bursts are characterized by blackbody emission accompanied by a power-law spectrum at higher energies. We discovered that the temperature of the blackbody emission is correlated with the peak energy of the spectrum. This correlation can be interpreted as the result of photospheric radius expansion during the early phases of the burst. Additionally, we found another correlation between the blackbody temperature \\( T_{bb} \\), the isotropic luminosity \\( L_{iso} \\), and the duration \\( t_{90} \\). The presence of these correlations suggests that the processes responsible for the blackbody emission may also influence other properties of the bursts. \n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which were discovered over 40 years ago, have been extensively studied, yet many questions remain unresolved. A significant inquiry pertains to the origin of the prompt emission in GRBs. It has been proposed that this emission could arise from internal shocks or magnetic reconnection within colliding relativistic outflows, or alternatively, from external shocks interacting with the surrounding medium. Another important issue is whether GRBs can be considered standard candles; if they are, one would expect that different bursts should exhibit variations in temporal and spectral characteristics.

Our findings indicate that the lifetimes of these bouncing droplets are influenced by their initial energy. We discovered that the relationship between lifetime and initial energy can be expressed using a power law, t ~ E0−α, where α = 0.5 ± 0.1, applicable to both numerical simulations and experiments. This scaling behavior suggests that the characteristics of a bouncing droplet depend only weakly on its initial energy. Additionally, we observed that the height reached during each bounce diminishes as the number of bounces increases. We also demonstrate how these results can be utilized to estimate the surface properties of materials based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have garnered significant interest in the field of microfluidics due to their potential applications. Typically, these experiments involve millimeter-sized droplets impacting hydrophobic surfaces, though smaller droplets can also bounce off superhydrophobic coatings. In many instances, it has been noted that the droplets exhibit consistent bouncing behavior. However, there are examples of non-standard bouncing and even chaotic motion. Recent research has shown that the lifetimes—i.e., the intervals between successive impacts—of bouncing droplets are significantly dependent on their initial velocities. For instance, if the initial velocity exceeds a certain threshold, the droplet will not bounce and will instead slide down the surface. Conversely, if the initial velocity is below a specific limit, the droplet can bounce indefinitely.",

The GVB state effectively describes many-body systems exhibiting strong correlations, such as spin liquids and Mott insulators. Our proposed method facilitates the generation of entanglement between two distant parties using only basic optical elements and single-photon sources. This exploration has potential applications in quantum communication. Quantum entanglement plays a significant role in various fields, including quantum computing, quantum metrology, and secure communication. Furthermore, entangled states have been demonstrated to be valuable resources for protocols like quantum teleportation, superdense coding, remote state preparation, and secure key distribution. Recent studies have shown an increasing interest in exploring entanglement within many-body systems. In particular, the wave function of strongly correlated fermions on lattices can be viewed as a composition of local singlet pairs, often referred to as valence bonds. This category encompasses valence bond solid (VBS) states. It has been discovered that VBS states can be represented by a certain valence bond basis, which includes notable examples such as the Néel state for antiferromagnetic systems, the Haldane state for integer spin chains, and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state representing gapped spin-1/2 systems. Recently, various proposals have emerged to experimentally generate these types of entangled states. However, all existing approaches rely on nonlinear interactions between photons and/or complex setups, making practical implementation challenging. Conversely, some recent demonstrations have successfully produced photonic qubits, suggesting it could be beneficial to explore methods to generate these entangled states without the need for nonlinear optical processes.",

We find that the inclusion of explicit pions leads to substantial enhancements in the accuracy of previously established calculations based on quark degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we illustrate how the EFT framework allows for the systematic inclusion of higher-order corrections in the calculations of observable quantities. In addition, we discuss the applicability of our approach to other hadronic systems, such as mesons or hypernuclei. The nucleon is understood as a composite system made up of quarks held together by gluons. However, it has been recognized since the inception of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that this simplistic picture does not entirely align with experimental results. While the proton’s electric charge radius aligns well with measurements, its magnetic moment is approximately 30% larger than expected from basic quark models. To address these discrepancies, it has been proposed that contributions from virtual meson fluctuations must be considered. These so-called meson-cloud effects are particularly significant when investigating large momentum transfers.

The metallic behavior of carbon nanotubes has been theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed, even when their diameter is smaller than the Fermi wavelength. Another intriguing aspect of low-dimensional systems is the emergence of various charge orders due to strong correlation effects. A crucial question is how to manipulate the electronic phase diagram of these low-dimensional materials. It is important to note that electronic properties depend not only on the geometry but also significantly on the compositional projections. Consequently, by tuning the composition of these low-dimensional systems, we can anticipate the emergence of new electronic phases. Recently, several studies have successfully synthesized low-dimensional materials with controlled compositions, leading to the discovery of many fascinating phenomena.",

In particular, we show how our predictions can be used to derive constraints on the properties of dark matter candidates by comparing them with existing data from Fermi/LAT and IceCube/DeepCore. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), if it exists, may interact weakly with ordinary matter through its self-annihilation products  1  . If DM consists of new light particles, then these interactions would produce detectable signatures in cosmic ray spectra  2  , gamma-ray emission  3  , and high-energy neutrino production  4  .\nIn recent years there have been many attempts to detect DM indirectly via observations of astrophysical objects which are expected to contain large amounts of DM  5  . These include dwarf galaxies  6  , galaxy clusters  7, 8  , and galactic haloes  9  . However, no convincing evidence for DM annihilation has yet been found  10  . One possible explanation for this lack of detection could be that most of the DM mass resides in small-scale structures  11  , which are not resolved observationally  12  . Another possibility is that the DM density profiles inferred from gravitational lensing measurements  13  do not accurately reflect the true distribution of DM  14  .

The data align with current theoretical understanding but feature some unexpected characteristics that may be attributed to foreground sources or effects related to our analysis process. We have utilized these findings to establish limits on possible contributions from primordial signals and other phenomena, such as topological defects. These limits are consistent with previous studies using different methodologies. Additionally, we report the detection of an exploratory signal at frequencies below 10 GHz, which is not predicted by current cosmological models.

        "rewrite_text": "In this study, we address the challenge of determining how many users to activate for multi-access broadcast channels (MABCs). We assume that the optimal number of active users is equal to the rank of the channel matrix when all users have the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and there are no power constraints at the base station. Subsequently, under more general conditions, we demonstrate that the optimal number of users is limited by the lower of the rank of the channel or the total number of available transmit antennas. We then present an algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial time complexity. This framework enables us to design more efficient MABCs while keeping computational costs manageable. In wireless communication, broadcasting refers to the transmission of signals simultaneously to multiple users over a shared medium, such as wireless frequencies or optical channels. This method is commonly employed in various applications, including television, video conferencing, and data transmission, where it is necessary to send messages to multiple users at once. However, due to limited resources, only a subset of these users will receive useful signals, while others may experience interference. This highlights the importance of optimizing the selection of users to activate so that each user can successfully receive their intended message without experiencing excessive interference from others. If one aims to maximize the overall throughput for all users, taking into account individual power constraints, the optimal strategy for selecting users becomes dependent not only on the channel state but also on the power allocation scheme. As a result, the joint optimization of user selection and power control presents significant complexity.",

The structure consists of a rooted binary tree with two fields associated with each node: a pointer and a rank. Each node maintains pointers to its left and right child nodes; however, unlike ordinary binary trees, multiple nodes can have the same key associated with any given parent node. Each node also contains a counter representing its rank, which indicates the number of keys equal to or smaller than the key of the current node that exist below it; if no such keys exist, the rank is zero.

        "rewrite_text": "We argue that the non-Gaussian distributions observed in financial returns stem from the microscopic interactions among traders and their fluctuating behaviors, which result in complex correlations across different time scales. We present a framework for understanding these correlations based on Random Matrix Theory (RMT), which can effectively replicate all significant characteristics of real market data with high accuracy. The analysis of price returns has been extensively conducted over many years. It has been found that these returns can often be approximated by a Gaussian function, yet notable deviations have been identified. Specifically, recent studies indicate that the tails of the return distribution follow a power law decay, P(r) ~ r^(-α), with α = 3 ± 0.1. This observation challenges the assumptions of standard models like Black-Scholes or Heston, where the expected exponent should be equal to 2. To explore the origins of these deviations, we propose a novel approach based on Random Matrix Theory. RMT addresses the statistics of complex systems whose behavior depends on a large number of degrees of freedom. It has been successfully applied to describe the fluctuations of diverse phenomena, such as fluid dynamics, image processing, spin systems, particle transport, and chaotic systems. Recently, RMT has also been employed to analyze the statistical properties of stock market behaviors. In this work, we will concentrate on the memoryless Dyson Brownian motion model, which illustrates the dynamics of financial assets under the influence of white noise.",

Additionally, the toroidal component of the magnetic field rapidly increases due to the winding of poloidal field lines by shear. Consequently, the magnetic Prandtl number decreases toward the center of the disk. We also find that the Maxwell stress associated with the magnetic field leads to an effective redistribution of angular momentum within the flow. This results in a more efficient outward transport of angular momentum compared to the transport induced by viscous stresses.",

Introduction  \nThe rapid advancement of wireless technologies has led to growing demands for high spectral efficiency and reliable transmission over limited bandwidth resources. To address these challenges, various multi-antenna techniques, such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), cooperative relaying, and cognitive radio, have garnered considerable attention. Among these, distributed antenna systems (DASs) offer significant benefits, including improved coverage, enhanced signal quality, reduced power consumption, and increased deployment flexibility. However, DASs also introduce certain challenges due to their operation in non-coherent environments. Specifically, the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter cannot be obtained through traditional uplink training or downlink feedback mechanisms. Consequently, accurately estimating the CSI has emerged as a critical concern in DAS design.\n\nTo tackle this issue, several studies have explored the simultaneous estimation of user activity and channel coefficients by leveraging only the inherent statistical properties of received signals, without any prior knowledge about the transmitted signals. These methods exploit the sparse nature of user activity patterns and employ second-order statistics and higher-order cumulants to identify active users in each cell. Subsequently, they determine the channel coefficients associated with these users.",

This investigation includes abundance measurements derived from experiments using radioactive nuclei at GSI Darmstadt. Lastly, I will discuss potential future experiments that could address some of the key uncertainties within the SM. \n\n**Keywords:** Photonuclear reactions, Light element synthesis, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical supernovae Ia explosions, Nuclear reaction processes.\n\n**1. Introduction** \n\nLight element synthesis during the early universe remains one of the most challenging questions in modern science. It has been established for some time that photons can induce nuclear fusion processes leading to the creation of light elements such as D, 3He, 4He, 7Li, and 9Be. However, our understanding of the dynamics involved in these processes has only recently begun to improve. Specifically, the temperatures (T) and densities (ρ) involved can reach up to 10^12 K and 10^15 g/cm³, respectively. These extreme conditions can only be replicated in laboratory experiments using relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, due to the short time scales involved, these experiments do not allow us to study the formation of light elements directly; instead, they provide insights into the properties of dense matter that may be relevant to the conditions present during the initial stages of supernova explosions. Conversely, the patterns of abundances observed in primordial stars, such as Population II stars or metal-poor stars, provide important constraints on the theoretical models regarding the formation of light elements in the early universe.",

We demonstrate how to compute this expression efficiently using O((n^2)(log n)) arithmetic operations and storage by combining fast matrix multiplication algorithms with techniques from numerical linear algebra. Our approach allows us to compute all minors simultaneously for any point x in the interval [0, 1] using only O((n^2)(log n)) arithmetic operations and storage space.

Our proposed framework operates on the premise that each neuron can be characterized as a cluster, reconstructed using its own weight vector.

Through experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses other state-of-the-art algorithms, including Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Growing Neural Gas (GNG), and Evolving Neural Gas (ENG).

However, a significant limitation of traditional SOMs is that they require users to specify the number of clusters in advance. To address this issue, several variations of SOMs have been proposed. Among these, the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) has gained attention for its ability to autonomously determine the topology of clusters during training. Nevertheless, most existing models of self-organizing networks suffer from two key drawbacks. First, all neurons in the network share the same set of parameters, hindering their ability to capture the distinct characteristics of different classes. Second, there is a lack of mechanisms to prevent overfitting when handling high-dimensional data.",

Additionally, quasars emit intense radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, making them valuable sources for investigating the properties of their surrounding environments. It has been proposed that quasars may initiate starburst activity in nearby regions through their ultraviolet (UV) radiation and/or feedback mechanisms (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006). Recently, multiple studies have examined the environments of high-redshift quasars through multi-wavelength observations, including optical and near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g., Adelberger & Steidel 2005; Venemans et al. 2007), radio continuum emissions (e.g., Carilli et al. 2007; Overzier et al. 2008), and X-ray emissions (e.g., Brandt et al. 2002; Gilli et al. 2003). However, much of the existing research has focused on relatively small scales (less than 1 Mpc) due to limitations in angular resolution and telescope capabilities.

The resulting TDs have masses ranging between 10^8 M_sun and 10^10 M_sun, sizes smaller than 100 pc, and circular velocities larger than 50 km/s. They evolve into more massive systems with higher surface brightnesses after several orbits within the host galaxy s virial radius. Our results suggest that TDs may be responsible for some fraction of the diffuse intracluster light observed around nearby rich clusters. Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are small star forming objects found near interacting or merging galaxies. Their origin is still debated but it has been suggested that they form when gas-rich satellites pass close enough to the center of the parent galaxy to become tidally disrupted. In this work we study the formation and evolution of TDGs using high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations performed with the code RAMSES-RT. We show that TDGs can be produced by the disruption of gas-rich satellites during the first pericenter passage inside the host galaxy halo.

These OIPCs are created through periodic modulation of the refractive index using femtosecond laser pulses directed into fused silica glass. We demonstrate that the defect modes can be tuned across a wide range of wavelengths, influenced by the periodicity of the photonic crystal as well as the dimensions of the defects. This research paves the way for innovative designs of optical devices utilizing these structures. Photonic crystal slabs have gained significant attention recently, as they offer an effective platform for investigating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Notably, three-dimensional photonic crystals with point or line defects can support localized states within their bandgap, leading to various intriguing applications such as lasers, sensors, and nonlinear optics. However, the fabrication of three-dimensional photonic crystals typically requires complex methods, which can complicate their integration with other nanoscale structures. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the successful fabrication of two-dimensional photonic crystals via direct laser writing techniques. These 2D photonic crystals provide advantages in terms of ease of fabrication, design flexibility, and compatibility with existing technologies. In this letter, we illustrate the emergence of defect modes in optically-induced photonic crystals (OPC). The OPCs are created by periodically modulating the refractive index using femtosecond laser pulses in fused silica glass. By introducing defects into the periodic structure, we observe localized defect modes within the stopband of the OPC. Moreover, we find that the defect modes can be tuned across the entire stopband by varying the spacing and/or the size of the defects.

This model is optimized for efficient computation of home ranges using integrated numerical methods. The implementation of the model is part of the R package adehabitatHR, which includes functions for calculating home ranges using the original approach (unpublished, without the partners’ solution). We illustrate how our method allows for rapid computation of home ranges over extensive landscapes composed of habitat patches. Our results indicate that the analytical solution yields home ranges comparable to those generated by the original method, though it requires less computational time when estimating home ranges over large spatial scales. Analytical solutions are particularly valuable since they enable researchers to estimate home ranges on large datasets or at finer resolutions. \n\nHome ranges have been a significant area of study in ecology since their introduction over 50 years ago. They represent the area within which individuals acquire essential resources such as food, shelter, mates, and cover. Beyond enhancing our understanding of animal behavior, home ranges are critical in conservation biology, wildlife management, epidemiology, and broader ecological research. Home-range models postulate that animals navigate through a mosaic of habitat patches. The movement of animals among these patches is influenced by various factors, including resource availability, vegetation structure, predation risk, and social interactions. This dynamic continues until a balance is reached between movement rates and resource availability.\n\nMultiple approaches exist for modeling animal movement.

        "rewrite_text": "Reverberation is a crucial aspect of clarity function, yet its role remains somewhat unclear. We propose that reverberation can arise from the interaction between calcium dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to a pause in spikes that is followed by periods of low firing rates caused by the depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. This altered pattern of neurotransmitter release results in an increase in calcium concentration, which promotes the facilitation of glutamate release during the recovery phase. This positive feedback loop supports sustained reverberatory activity across multiple time scales. We suggest that reverberation plays a significant role in the recovery of neural function in certain brain areas. Reverberation is one of the most notable features of brain activity and has been observed in various species, including in the repetitive activity of the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellar cortex, olfactory bulbs, and retina. Despite its common occurrence, the specific functional roles of reverberation in neural processing are still not fully understood. Some theories propose that reverberation aids in memory storage or retrieval, while others suggest it could serve as a substrate for working memory or provide a mechanism for temporal processing.

We discovered that all samples, regardless of their doping levels, exhibit Curie temperatures around 300 K, which is significantly higher than previously reported values. Our observations indicate that magnetization increases linearly as the external magnetic field decreases and demonstrates hysteresis loops at low fields. These results suggest that the ferromagnetic behavior originates from an exchange coupling between localized spins rather than intrinsic ferromagnetism. There is a growing interest in developing materials for spintronic applications, such as nonvolatile memory devices, which leverage the manipulation of electron spins rather than charge carriers. Among these materials, diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) have garnered considerable attention due to their dual site and magnetic functionalities. ZnO-based DMSs, in particular, have been extensively researched because of their wide bandgap (3.37 eV), substantial exciton binding energy (60 meV), high transparency, and material stability. However, achieving high-temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO-based DMSs has proven challenging. Although several studies have recently demonstrated observations of room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in various ZnO-based DMS systems, most have reported relatively low saturation magnetizations. In this report, we document the observation of high-temperature ferromagnetism in Mn-doped ZnO-based DMSs produced through PLD.

INTRODUCTION\nThe dynamics of hadronic interactions play a crucial role in comprehending the strong forces between quarks and gluons within hadrons. Specifically, the parton distribution functions provide insights into the distribution of quarks and gluons inside hadrons. Recently, there has been significant progress in investigating the internal structures of hadrons beyond the leading twist approximation, including the analysis of transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions. In this study, we focus on a different type of nonperturbative object—the light-cone distribution amplitudes (DAs). These amplitudes describe the probability of finding a quark-antiquark pair with a given longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse position at a fixed light-like separation. It has been demonstrated that they play an important role in exclusive processes. For example, the decay constants \\( f_{B\\pi} \\) and \\( f_{Bs} \\) can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs, and the rates for semileptonic decays \\( B \\to \\pi l \\nu_l \\) and \\( B \\to K l \\nu_l \\) depend on both the lowest and higher-order DAs.

Furthermore, this explanation clarifies the absence of close-in giant planets around PTTS, even though these stars have undergone significant evolution in their protoplanetary disks.

Specifically, we find that the pump current will flow whenever the Fermi energy aligns with a bound state within the gap created by the Coulomb interaction in the quantum dot. The magnitude of this current increases with temperature \\( T \\), allowing us to utilize the system as a thermometer.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in using pulsed drives as sources of coherent quantum transport. This concept was initially proposed over two decades ago but has only recently seen experimental realization. A particularly intriguing class of periodically driven systems consists of those whose properties are highly sensitive to their internal degrees of freedom. These models, often referred to as impurity models, have garnered considerable attention because they offer insights into a variety of phenomena, ranging from quantum dot transistors to heavy fermion systems. Recently, several studies have theoretically explored the potential of using quantum dots and carbon nanotubes as electron pumps. However, most existing work has focused on non-interacting models, while experiments typically involve strong interactions. Thus, there is a need to extend the current understanding beyond the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this work is to investigate the effects of electron correlations on the performance of a quantum dot-based electron pump. To achieve this, we consider a quantum dot connected to two leads via tunneling barriers. One lead is driven out of equilibrium by applying a time-varying gate voltage \\( V_g(t) \\), while the other lead acts as a reference electrode.

Notably, we show how to derive expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions.

However, identifying physically interesting solutions often proves challenging. Historically, it took over a century after the formulation of general relativity for black hole solutions to be discovered. Despite this progress, significant questions regarding black holes persist. One major difficulty in finding these solutions arises from the fact that most interesting solutions do not possess any known analytic forms. Additionally, when attempting to find solutions associated with multiple fields, such as black holes surrounded by matter or other fields, the resulting equations typically become complex differential equations that require numerical methods for their exploration, complicating the resolution of various issues—even if their existence can be guaranteed theoretically. This challenge is further exacerbated when looking to study phenomena at strong coupling, where reliable solutions may be hindered by substantial corrections resulting from higher-order perturbative expansions.",

Notably, we highlight how the stretching exponent can serve as a measure of the level of disorder in the sample being examined. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for other systems exhibiting avalanche dynamics.

Our study utilized high-precision radial velocity data collected over more than four years by the HARPS spectrograph at ESO's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in the Chilean Andes, along with photometric observations made simultaneously with the CoRoT satellite. By applying standard methods used in asteroseismology, we identified several periodicities in both datasets, including one signal whose periodicity matches the orbital period of the binary system. This finding supports the idea that the pulsational behavior of this star is influenced by tidal effects from its companion. Additionally, our analysis reveals another set of signals with periods ranging from about 1 day to just under 2 days. These signals can be attributed to rotationally induced p-mode oscillations excited in the convective zone of the star. Their presence provides strong evidence that the surface of Alpha Centauri A has been shaped by magnetic activity generated by dynamo processes within the convective zone.",

We find that these films can exhibit anomalously large values for their Young's moduli and Poisson ratios. The realization of these effects is attributed to the presence of phonon soft modes linked to the periodicity of the film’s microstructure. These findings have implications for designing novel materials with tailored elastic properties. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how confinement alters the mechanical behavior of materials at the nanoscale. This issue is particularly relevant when exploring the properties of thin films or nanowires with microstructures; however, it becomes more pronounced when the material is restricted to only a portion of its available configuration. Such conditions frequently occur during growth processes, where defects can be introduced into the material by impurities, or during the study of colloidal suspensions.

This process has been extensively studied using numerical simulations based on resistive MHD models, varying in complexity from simplified two-dimensional models to more realistic three-dimensional simulations.

In this presentation, I will discuss the physics behind the g-2 experiment at Fermilab, which aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with greater accuracy than ever before by utilizing a novel technique based on laser cooling and trapping developed in recent years. This effort underscores the scientific rationale for the proposed new measurement of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment at Fermilab.

They appear to be considerably more compact than typical starburst galaxies like Arp 220 or M82, which generally harbor more diffuse stellar populations.

Our findings indicate that FPTs can be modified by either adding or removing nodes, which subsequently leads to an increase in the proportion of cooperators at equilibrium. These observations hold true for both static and dynamic models of cooperation. Notably, we assert that while the presence of FPTs is significant, it is not essential for high levels of cooperation. Additionally, we propose a straightforward strategy to identify the optimal rounding configurations necessary to achieve maximum levels of cooperation. The rounding of first-order transitions plays a crucial role in scale-free networks. \n\nIn our research, we analyze how first-order phase transitions influence the dynamics of cooperation in social dilemmas. We begin by defining two key concepts: minimal and maximal cooperative states, which characterize parameter ranges where cooperation outweighs defection. Employing these concepts, we demonstrate that any system with phase transition properties has a unique set of parameter values that correspond to the fraction of cooperators. We then address the challenge of optimizing cooperation within these frameworks. To achieve this, we introduce a technique for rounding the parameters of first-order transitions, allowing for adjustments without altering the overall fraction of cooperators within the range of 0 to 1. Through numerical simulations, we show that this rounding process enhances the equilibrium fraction of cooperators across all scenarios examined. Lastly, we develop a method for determining the optimal rounding configurations needed to maximize cooperation.",

        "rewrite_text": "We propose a clear criterion to assess whether two multipartite quantum states are separable, meaning they can be expressed as a combination of product states. This criterion is stated using the Bloch representation of the density matrices and focuses solely on measurements performed by each party. We argue that our approach provides a more straightforward criterion for separability that is less stringent than existing methods. To demonstrate its applicability, we provide several examples.\n\n**Introduction:** The challenge of determining whether a given state is part of the set of separable states has been extensively explored in recent years. Various authors have suggested different approaches to tackle this issue, yet none have confidently provided a definitive solution. Recently, Vidal introduced a novel method for assessing separability using the Bloch representation of the density matrices associated with any pure state. This technique allows for local measurements relevant to each party involved, but it falls short when applied to mixed states as it requires knowledge of all pure-state decompositions of such states. Here, we introduce an improved version of the Bloch representation to develop a general criterion for separability applicable to mixed states. Our results show that there is at least one decomposition into pure states that aligns with the Bloch representation of every separable state. Thus, we posit that the criterion we present is a more accessible approach for determining separability, distinct from existing criteria.\n\n**Preliminaries:** We consider an N-partite system described by Hilbert spaces \\( H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_N \\).

This solution is underpinned by two independent Lagrangian functions, one residing on each side of a hypersurface Σ, which divides into three distinct regions. We demonstrate that this solution maintains eight real supercharges and has a vanishing total charge. It can be interpreted as a bound state of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, coupled with gauge groups SU(N) × SU(N), where the number of degrees of freedom scales as O(N²) in the large N limit. Furthermore, we discuss a class of solutions connecting different vacua of the same theory. These solutions are obtained by taking appropriate limits of our general formulation, exhibiting four supercharges and having non-vanishing quantum numbers. One specific solution we explore describes a supersymmetric Janus-like configuration that interpolates between two conformal fixed points of the same theory.\n\nIntroduction: The significant advancements in holographic dualities related to strongly coupled quantum field theories have been greatly influenced by string/M-theory. A particularly intriguing application of these concepts involves studying non-conformal theories using their dual descriptions in terms of holographic models. To construct such models, it is crucial to solve the equations of motion associated with minimal supergravity or gauged supergravity. This task becomes more manageable when the configurations preserve some fraction of the original supersymmetry, as only specific combinations of fields contribute to the solutions. In scenarios where we consider states that retain nearly all of the original supersymmetries (BPS states), the resulting dynamics depend on just five scalar fields. However, it remains challenging to find explicit solutions. One approach to tackling BPS-type equations is to consider cases where the geometry exhibits certain symmetries. An important subset of these scenarios arises when the internal manifold M6 factors into a direct product of two manifolds, M3 × M3.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present the results of our analysis of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with HST/STIS for four nearby (z < 0.1) X-ray selected Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) in order to investigate their progenitors.

The presence of such CSM is consistent with models for post-luminous blue variable (LBV) Wolf-Rayet stars. Additionally, we detect narrow emission features that likely originate from interactions between the supernova ejecta and the surrounding wind. These findings impose strong constraints on the nature of the progenitor systems: they suggest the existence of Wolf-Rayet stars that are part of binary systems capable of transferring mass prior to their explosive events.

Our analysis of high-resolution STIS/HST data for these four nearby (z < 0.1; X-ray-selected) Type Ibc supernovae has provided insights into the properties of their progenitors. All four exhibit evidence of circumstellar matter (CSM; nH > 10^20 cm^-3) within 0.01 to 0.20 parsecs from the supernova locations. These high densities are indicative of the ejection of material during late stages of evolution. Furthermore, we observe narrow emission features that likely relate to the heating of the CSM by the supernova remnant.

Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in studying this model due to its potential applications in fields such as quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Specifically, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum \\( J = N/2 \\) (where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms). The Dicke model was originally proposed over fifty years ago, and since then, various theoretical approaches have been developed to analyze it. Among these, one of the most notable is the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, which allows the original problem to be mapped to a spin-1/2 system. This method is particularly effective in the weak coupling regime, where interactions between atoms are relatively weak. However, it becomes unreliable in the strong coupling limit, as the transformation can lead to unphysical states. Recently, multiple authors have attempted to address this limitation by introducing alternative transformations or approximations, though these methods still face certain challenges.",

This framework allows us to derive expressions for the second-order fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields at any point along the propagation path.

The game’s virtual environment is divided into regions that are interconnected through player movements. Each region contains a significant number of individual households, ranging from dozens to several hundred. Our approach combines household interactions with character-to-character contacts inferred from the in-game movements to simulate disease transmission at both regional and global levels. We evaluate our model against epidemiological models derived from actual census data, noting a high level of agreement, especially when we scale down the size of the simulated population.

A key aspect of our work is that it produces outflowing winds, which can significantly enhance the surrounding environment. This effect leads to conditions where the dynamics become nearly Keplerian near the black hole's event horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these winds provide sufficient support against gravitational collapse, preventing the density of the surrounding medium from dropping too low.

Our findings indicate that the SHC is independent of temperature, gate potential, and disorder, provided that the Fermi level remains within the Zeeman gap. The calculations are performed using the Kubo formula alongside the self-consistent Born approximation. Recent studies have demonstrated that a spin current can be generated without any net charge current when electrons travel through a non-magnetic material under the influence of spin-orbit coupling. This phenomenon, known as spin Hall effect, has been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed. The underlying mechanism involves the generation of a transverse force that deflects the trajectories of moving charges, resulting in finite spin polarization at the edges of the material. There have been various theoretical approaches aimed at understanding different aspects of spin Hall transport. However, most of this research has been conducted in the absence of strong magnetic fields, where Landau quantization effects do not play a significant role. Conversely, it is well-known that Landau quantization is crucial for numerous transport properties, such as magnetoresistance and optical absorption, particularly near the quantum limit. Therefore, it is of great interest to explore how Landau quantization influences the behavior of the spin Hall conductivity.",

These findings are discussed in the context of the recent development in the theory of \"inverse condensation.\" \n\nIntroduction: There has been growing interest in studying strongly correlated systems where competing interactions lead to complex phase diagrams exhibiting various intriguing phenomena such as valence bond solids (VBS), charge density waves (CDW), or supersolids. One particularly fascinating example is provided by layered antiferromagnets. These materials consist of weakly coupled planes of spins arranged in a regular structure. Due to strong geometric frustration caused by competing nearest-neighbor interactions \\(J_1\\) along the layers and \\(J_2\\) across the planes, these systems exhibit a rich array of phenomena, ranging from long-range Néel order at low temperatures to disordered paramagnetic states at high temperatures.\n\nIn this work, we focus on two prototypical members of this class of materials: CuGeO\\(_3\\), where each tetrahedral unit forms a honeycomb-like lattice, and BaCo\\(_2\\)As\\(_2\\), which consists of layers made up of corner-sharing triangles. Both materials have garnered significant interest due to their unusual magnetic behavior. For instance, in CuGeO\\(_3\\), it has been experimentally shown that the system transitions from a collinear antiferromagnetically ordered state below \\(T_N = 29\\) K to a non-collinear VBS state above \\(T^* \\approx 70\\) K. In contrast, the situation in BaCo\\(_2\\)As\\(_2\\) is more complex, with several studies suggesting the coexistence of three distinct magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic order below \\(T_C = 38\\) K and a helimagnetic phase.",

It implies the existence of two populations among very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs: those that are associated with nearby clusters or associations and those that are not gravitationally bound to any cluster. This indicates that some brown dwarfs may reside outside of known clusters or disperse quickly after formation. Finally, we examine the implications of these findings for understanding the kinematics of the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs.",

This research was funded by NSF grant PHY-0960291 (M.S.) and DOE grants DE-FG03-92-ER40701 and DE-SC0012704 (A.K.).\n\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS: The experimental realization of quantum degenerate gases has opened new avenues for understanding strongly correlated many-body systems. Ultracold atomic gases, in particular, have been employed to investigate phenomena such as fermionization, supersolidity, and Mott insulating states. In this article, we examine a captivating class of experiments where the properties of these systems can be explored by varying their parameters. For instance, if the strength of inter-boson repulsion or the density of the gas is altered, it takes some time for the system to reach thermal equilibrium. During this nonequilibrium phase, the system exhibits novel features like dynamical scaling and non-thermal fixed points. These phenomena are crucial for our fundamental understanding of quantum matter and provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing novel phases of matter.\n\nRecently, there has been significant interest in the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosonic systems. A particularly well-studied scenario is when the system is initially prepared in a highly excited state far from equilibrium. Interestingly, despite being in a state far from equilibrium, the system tends to relax into a steady state that can be characterized by a Gibbs distribution. Conversely, if the initial state lies deeply within the ordered phase, the system behaves differently and does not simply relax to the expected steady state.",

        "rewrite_text": "We propose an experiment to entangle two independent photons in a controlled time environment, utilizing only passive optical elements and photon detectors. This approach is based on comparing the arrival times of the photons at different locations. We believe this measurement can facilitate entanglement between the photons without the need for post-selection or backward causation. This method holds promise for applications in quantum communication networks, where it could enable the generation of entangled states over significant distances. Entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, including condensed matter systems, atomic gases, trapped ions, and quantum information theory. Specifically, entanglement is essential for applications such as quantum teleportation, superdense coding, secure key distribution, and quantum computing. In recent years, several proposals have been made to generate entanglement between remote photons. However, most of these schemes rely on nonlinear optical processes, which can be challenging to implement experimentally, or involve post-selection, which complicates the analysis. Recently, we introduced a straightforward method to generate entanglement between remote photons using only passive optical components and photon detectors. Our approach focuses on measuring the precise arrival times of the photons at different locations. In this paper, we present detailed calculations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and assess its experimental feasibility. Figure 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of our setup, where two identical sources emit pairs of photons (shown in red) toward Alice’s station (A) and Bob’s station (B). Each source utilizes a laser to generate photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. These photons travel through separate paths until they reach stations A and B. At these locations, Alice and Bob perform measurements on their respective photons, noting the arrival times \\( t_A \\) and \\( t_B \\).",

We investigate both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state to determine how the MRI is influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the gas. In all scenarios, we find that the growth rate of the fastest-growing mode aligns well with linear theoretical expectations when appropriately normalized. However, there are notable differences in our results depending on whether the simulations have reached steady-state equilibrium. For instance, the stress profiles observed at late stages vary among different models. This indicates that precise predictions of the saturation levels of the MRI may require high-resolution simulations that run for extended periods, encompassing multiple orbital cycles. Lastly, we find that the inclusion of radiative effects does not significantly impact the characteristics of the turbulence generated by the MRI.",

For certain metal-rich GGCs, we have observed that their ages, as inferred from classical models, can be as young as 10 billion years, while previous studies suggest they should be older than 12 billion years. This inconsistency highlights a limitation of the classical models in accurately reproducing the observed color-magnitude diagrams of such metal-rich clusters.

Additionally, we observe a pronounced broadening of the elastic linewidth Γₑₗ at low energy, which indicates short-range spin-spin correlations on the order of ξₛ ~ 5 Å. Moreover, we detect a substantial increase in the dynamic susceptibility χ′′(Q, ω), which can be attributed to low-energy spin excitations occurring below T* ~ 50 K. These findings align with theoretical predictions regarding quasi-two-dimensional systems near critical points. Our data imply that the system transitions into a state where the Fermi surface becomes susceptible to the formation of electron pairs, analogous to Cooper pairing. \n\nIntroduction: A significant number of studies have shown that many strongly correlated electronic systems display fascinating properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity or non-Fermi liquid behavior. A critical aspect of these phenomena is the existence of collective charge and/or spin degrees of freedom, which influence characteristic features in the excitation spectrum. For instance, in cuprate-based high-temperature superconductors, the pseudogap regime is thought to originate from competing orders arising from various regions of the Brillouin zone. Similarly, in iron pnictides, the presence of a spin-density wave leads to a modification of the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a partial gap. In heavy fermion systems, the hybridization of f-electrons contributes to a nontrivial configuration of the self-energy. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the spin fluctuation spectrum in the metallic phase of this quasi-two-dimensional superconductor.",

We establish that the dynamics are characterized by a chordal Schramm-Loewner evolution when the underlying paths are loop-free and do not contain multiple edges; otherwise, they are described by radial Schramm-Loewner evolutions. The models are realized using conformal field theory. In particular, we demonstrate that the partition function of these models can be interpreted as a correlation function of specific operators in some conformally invariant theory. This allows us to derive formulas for the interface scaling limits associated with the configurations, such as their winding numbers around different points. \n\nIntroduction: The concept of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE) was introduced by Schramm in 2000, who showed that they represent the scaling limits of certain lattice models in statistical mechanics at criticality.

Our analysis indicates that the spectrum of this remnant can be modeled by two thermal components with temperatures of T1 = 7×10^6 K and T2 = 2×10^6 K. Additionally, we observe non-thermal emissions exceeding 10 keV. By employing these parameters, we estimate the age of the SNR to be around 4000 years, which aligns well with the expected timescale for the expansion of the shell into the surrounding interstellar medium.

The inputs for the ANN include parameters such as peak ground acceleration, duration of seismic events, number of stories, story height, mass density per unit area, damping coefficient, moment of inertia, elastic modulus, shear wall stiffness, and moment connection properties.

This model suggests that the system is not in equilibrium at any point during its Eisenhower response. We demonstrate how this approach can be utilized to extract information about the phonon spectrum and the density of states of charge carriers from TSL data obtained across various types of samples. We compare our findings with data obtained from other methods such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and Raman scattering. Specifically, we show that our method is effective in determining the energy gap between the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum in semiconductors. This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (grant No. 14-50-00040). DOI: 10.1063/1.4935190\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS The study of luminescence phenomena has garnered significant interest due to its ability to provide insights into the electronic structures and optical properties of solids. Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly valuable as it allows us to investigate the behavior of electrons that have been excited into the conduction band. Despite numerous studies focusing on specialized models and various aspects of luminescence, most of this research has relied on the assumption that the system is always near equilibrium. Consequently, these models fail to accurately describe several important experimental observations. For instance, the shape of the TSL curve is highly dependent on the material type: it typically exhibits a single peak in insulators, while in semiconductors, it often displays multiple features. Furthermore, even within the same category of materials, such as semiconductor crystals, the characteristics of the luminescence can vary significantly based on doping levels. These phenomena remain inadequately explained by existing theories.",

However, exploring vast datasets presents several challenges, as traditional, rule-based approaches are often inadequate. For example, to identify anomalies in a continuous stream of tweets, one must analyze all incoming messages and pinpoint those that deviate from expected behavior. To tackle these issues, researchers have developed advanced methodologies for analyzing complex data. One notable area within data mining focuses on discovering interesting patterns through data exploration. A common task in this field is the identification of patterns within datasets. Another significant research avenue involves uncovering correlations between different attributes. These tasks are often performed in conjunction with classification and regression techniques.",

        "rewrite_text": "We examine the formation of cosmic strings related to Ducks Shipping as part of a broader franchise, focusing on their origins and developmental growth. We propose that these strings may form when magnetic fields become trapped in regions of high density during the inflationary period. This leads to the formation of multiple small loops, which can evolve into larger structures through the emission of gravitational waves. This concept ties into proposals aimed at exploring electroweak phenomena post-inflation. However, we suggest that the characteristics of these loops differ from current assumptions. Specifically, they tend to form larger loops sized according to the Hubble radius today. These cosmic loops could potentially be detected as stochastic signals of gravitational waves or through the effects of cosmic lensing. Cosmic strings have been theorized to exist since the late 1980s, and their discovery could provide insights into dimensions beyond those currently known or offer clues at symmetry-breaking events. Expected observable effects from cosmic strings include gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomalies, and even the formation of primordial black holes. Despite significant interest, direct evidence for cosmic strings has yet to be found. One reason for their elusiveness is likely their extremely small mass (less than \\(10^{-16} eV\\)). Additionally, they might not be stable and could decay rapidly, making direct observation challenging. Therefore, any observational evidence would likely need to be inferred from indirect signatures of their decay. To further investigate potential observations, cosmological simulations are necessary.

Our results indicate that the IR emission can be explained by temperatures ranging from 100 K to 1000 K, which corresponds to an observed flux density at 8 microns between 0.1 mJy and 1 Jy. Notably, the spectral index of the IR emission did not vary significantly during this period. This suggests that the physical conditions in the emitting region remain relatively stable over timescales as short as one day. These observations imply that the IR emission is likely dominated by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron radiation. \n\nKeywords: black hole physics, accretion disks, variability sources, space telescopes, X-ray emissions. \n\nBlack holes are known to generate electromagnetic fields near their event horizons. However, gathering direct observational evidence has proven challenging due to the extreme conditions surrounding them. One potential method for detecting these fields could involve measuring polarized radiation emitted close to the horizon. Another approach may involve detecting variations in the spectrum or timing of emissions from the accretion flow onto the black hole itself. This could occur if the magnetic field lines in the accretion disk become twisted into helical shapes due to differential rotation. If this happens, the field lines can act like antennas, enhancing incoming radiation. Consequently, the overall luminosity will increase, causing the emission to become more opaque to lower-energy radiation while remaining less opaque to higher-energy frequencies. As a result, we anticipate that the emission spectrum will steepen toward lower wavelengths as the brightness of the source increases.",

However, at higher coverages, we observed collective effects that lead to the formation of ordered structures. Importantly, we identified that these structures can be classified into two categories based on whether they consist of a single layer or multiple layers of silver atoms. Specifically, we discovered that the stability of the single-layer structures is highly dependent on the substrate temperature, while the stability of the multi-layer structures shows only slight variations. Lastly, our calculations indicated that the third structure corresponds to a disordered arrangement of silver atoms. This research was supported by DGESIC under project PB98-0443-C02-01.",

We find that the ground state is always gapped and shows no degeneracy. Depending on whether the system is antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (F), the elementary excitations can be fractionally charged fermions or bosons. In the AF case, we observe fermionic excitations that carry zero electric charge while exhibiting nontrivial braiding properties. These results can be understood by mapping our models onto lattice gauge theories, where the elementary excitations correspond to topological defects associated with fractionalized quanta. Our work provides insight into how fractional charges arise as topological defects in strongly correlated systems. \n\nIntroduction: The phenomena of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate oxides, along with other behaviors such as colossal magnetoresistance and non-Fermi liquid behavior, have reinvigorated interest in the physics of strongly correlated electrons. A fundamental question concerns the nature of the elementary excitations relevant to these novel systems. It has been suggested that these excitations can be described as collective modes related to spin dynamics. However, it is still unclear how this description manifests at low energies due to strong electron correlations. Recently, considerable progress has been made in developing models based on fractionalized quasiparticles, emergent gauge fields, and topological entities. Experiments suggest that the elementary excitations in cuprates can indeed be characterized as fractionalized quasiparticles, raising intriguing questions about their properties, including charge, statistics, and braiding. Unfortunately, despite significant advances, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of these aspects remains elusive. A promising approach involves studying simplified Hamiltonians whose low-energy limits can capture essential features of the original problem.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS In recent times, there has been considerable interest in developing innovative approaches to study the properties of quantized fields based on the principles of quantum optics. One such approach involves the introduction of position eigenvectors, which play a crucial role in defining the state of a single photon. It is important to note that the concept of position eigenvectors not only facilitates the examination of the spatial aspects of the electromagnetic field but also enables the investigation of the temporal behavior of photons. This opens up new possibilities for applying the proposed method to analyze various phenomena occurring during the propagation of light through dispersive materials. Additionally, the incorporation of eigenvectors into the framework of quantized fields paves the way for describing certain nonclassical effects associated with photon emission.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\nThe Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) has been studied for over 50 years. It describes a ferromagnetic system where each spin interacts solely with its nearest neighbors via exchange interactions, while also feeling an external magnetic field that varies across different sites. Numerous studies, both experimental and theoretical, have focused on this model. This interest is fueled by the realization that the RFIM shares characteristics with real systems, such as diluted antiferromagnets and spin-glasses. For instance, the presence of quenched disorder leads to phenomena akin to those observed in spin-glass systems. Moreover, the RFIM exhibits a rich phase diagram depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field. At low fields, it behaves as a paramagnet, while above a certain threshold, the spins align, resulting in a ferromagnetic state. Eventually, if the external field exceeds another critical value, the magnetization experiences a discontinuous transition. These three regimes are captured by two second-order phase transitions occurring at different temperatures. Nonetheless, despite these similarities between the RFIM and other systems, the precise nature of the phase transitions remains an area of active research.",

However, we also observed that some scientists who obtain NIH funding for non-biomedical research still devote the majority of their time to biomedical research. Furthermore, our research reveals that scientists' perceptions of how much time they spend on biomedical versus non-biomedical research do not always align with their actual behaviors.",

A point \\( x \\in X \\) is called a strong peak point if there exists a functional \\( f \\in X^* \\) such that \\( |f(x)| = \\sup \\{ |f(y)| : y \\in X \\} \\). We establish that every separable reflexive Banach space has a nonempty set of strong peak points. As applications of this result, we demonstrate that every separable reflexive Banach space contains a copy of \\( c_0 \\), and that every separable superreflexive Banach space contains a subspace isomorphic to \\( l_p \\) for some \\( 1 < p < \\infty \\). This note further explores the characteristics of strong peak points in Banach spaces. The importance of this subject was highlighted by J. Lindenstrauss, who proved that every separable reflexive Banach space has a nonempty set of strong peak points (refer to [JL1]). In Section 2, we present several equivalent characterizations of strong peak points. In particular, we show that a point \\( x \\in X \\) is a strong peak point if and only if there exist sequences \\( (a_n) \\) and \\( (b_n) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) satisfying \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = 1 \\) and \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n b_n = 0 \\) such that the sequence \\( (a_n b_n) \\) converges weakly to zero but not strongly. This characterization allows us to develop our first results concerning the density of strong peak points in separable reflexive Banach spaces. Theorem 3 states that every separable reflexive Banach space has a set \\( SP(X) \\) of strong peak points. Immediate consequences of Theorem 3 include: (i) Every separable reflexivizable space contains a copy of \\( c_0 \\), and (ii) Every separable superreflexive space contains a subspace that is isomorphic to \\( l_p \\).",

The second sample includes around 10,000 photometrically selected galaxies over an area of roughly 30 deg² centered on the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S). The CMD reveals the existence of three distinct galaxy populations based on their rest-frame luminosities: red-sequence early-type galaxies, green valley late-type galaxies, and star-forming blue cloud galaxies. Furthermore, we find that the fraction of star-forming blue cloud galaxies increases with increasing redshift up to about z ~ 2.5 - 3.0, after which it declines. This trend can be explained by the fact that most star-forming galaxies were actively forming stars until approximately z ~ 3, making them appear redder at lower redshifts; subsequently, the red-sequence population dominates at high redshifts. Conversely, the less mature star-forming galaxies continue to be observed until later times, leading to larger fractions of blue cloud galaxies at lower redshifts.",

Finally, we show that the resulting expression can be expressed in terms of Feynman diagrams, which are then employed to analyze various physical manifestations such as the spectral representation and correlation functions.

Unfortunately, many individuals who are not formally trained as scientists do not think like physicists, often making mistakes that can lead to misconceptions. For example, if asked whether two objects will fall to the ground due to their mass, many might mistakenly believe that gravity only affects objects that are in direct contact. However, according to Newtonian mechanics, gravitational attraction acts on all matter, regardless of distance. If you were to ask someone why two objects don't fall together, they might suggest that a string holds them apart, leading to an erroneous conclusion. While this reasoning may seem plausible, it overlooks the fact that the force exerted by the string is negligible compared to the individual forces acting on the objects, rendering the explanation flawed.",

We will explore how this concept can be implemented in a particular field theory framework. Additionally, we will examine the experimental signatures that such models may produce at future colliders. The Standard Model (SM) is one of the most successful theories developed to describe physical phenomena across a vast range of scales, from subatomic particles to cosmological structures. However, questions regarding its fundamental principles have led to motivations for theories beyond the SM. Notably, since the early days of quantum mechanics, it has been recognized that the SM Lagrangian doesn't fully comply with all Poincaré symmetries. This limitation raises questions about the Lorentz invariance of the SM, even though it has been supported by experimental evidence. Recent years have seen a growing interest in models where some or all of these symmetries are spontaneously broken, largely driven by the need to understand neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism. These models often introduce heavy fermions that break global symmetry, which is crucial for generating the otherwise massless nature of the SM vector bosons. Consequently, these interactions lead to tiny mass corrections while still preserving the longitudinal polarization states of the gauge bosons.",

The SMRM technique allows us to map the magnetic field distributions near the wire structures, which are utilized for transporting ultra-cold atoms between various trapping locations. We have determined that the magnetic fields produced by these wires can be accurately modeled using Biot-Savart's law for straight current-carrying conductors. Additionally, we have detected field deviations occurring below a distance of 100 micrometers from the wire surfaces. These deviations may originate from stray fields in the substrate or from the complex geometries of the wires near their surfaces. Our results demonstrate that SMRM is well-suited for imaging magnetic field distributions around microscopic structures such as atom chips. Atom chips have been developed as miniaturized devices for manipulating neutral atomic matter and consist of arrays of metallic wires and microtraps fabricated using focused ion beam milling, where ultracold atoms are guided along the wires before being confined in the microtraps. To optimize the manipulation of atoms, it is crucial to understand how the magnetic fields generated by the wires influence the behavior of the atoms. This necessitates detailed knowledge about the spatial characteristics of the magnetic fields surrounding the wires. However, direct measurements using techniques like SQUID-based magnetometry are challenging due to the thinness of the wires. Therefore, indirect methods, such as tracking the trajectories of atoms released from traps or measuring the forces acting on them, have been used instead. Recently, scanning Hall probe microscopy has been employed to investigate the magnetic fields in this context.

Our analysis indicates that the majority of JTs are either S-type or C-type asteroids. However, we identified four outliers with unusual spectral characteristics; one is classified as an E-type asteroid, while the other three exhibit featureless red-sloped continua. These unique specimens may represent primitive bodies similar to carbonaceous chondrites. Additionally, we observe that some JTs belong to dynamically cold families, suggesting that these families were likely formed recently through catastrophic collisions among larger bodies.

One of these is associated with the Cyg OB2 #8 cluster (HESS J1640-465), while the other is located near the heavily populated WR 25 (HESS J1641-463). Our data reveals extended emission surrounding both TeV sources, which is not captured by previously recovered data. We explore various scenarios for this emission based on our results, as well as recent findings by other researchers. Specifically, we suggest that the observed structures may be due to synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons accelerated in shock waves created by interactions among these massive stars. This could explain the lack of detected X-ray counterparts despite extensive searches conducted with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Additionally, we estimate the magnetic field required to produce such emissions using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries. \n\nIntroduction: The Cygnus OB2 association contains over 100 OB stars distributed across approximately 50 square degrees, centered at l = 80° and b = 1° (see Fig. 1a). It has been proposed that many of these stars may be members of binary systems or even multiple star systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010). These systems can generate powerful winds that interact with their surroundings, creating strong shocks where ultra-relativistic particles can be accelerated to very high energies. If some of these particles collide with surrounding photons from the interstellar medium, they may emit radiation detectable across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including TeV wavelengths. Several studies suggest that multiple known TeV sources may be linked to the Cygnus OB2 region (e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a, b, 2007a). However, only a few of these associations have been thoroughly investigated through optical, infrared, spectroscopy, or continuum observations (see e.g., Reimer & Böttcher 2006; Castro-Tirado et al.).",

The D0 collaboration at Fermilab is actively searching for this signal in its dataset and has analyzed various processes, including the production of top quarks via t-channel interactions with a virtual W boson and s-channel interactions through gluon fusion. In both scenarios, no significant excess over the background has been observed. We share our findings here, in conjunction with results from other experiments that have searched for similar signals. The CMS experiment has also presented evidence for an unexpected scalar particle decaying into pairs of photons or leptons. This observation is consistent with the Standard Model prediction for the Higgs boson, which is expected to have a mass around 126 GeV. In addition to the standard Higgs boson studies conducted by ATLAS and CMS, there are numerous models within the Standard Model that predict additional scalar particles. These models could result in deviations from the Standard Model predictions for the Higgs boson properties, including its spin, parity, CP violation, coupling constants, branching ratios, and more. Many of these scenarios propose the existence of heavy partners that could be detected as pair signals at hadron colliders. However, some theories suggest that the Higgs-like state could be a singlet under SU(2) and U(1), which means these states could not decay into pairs but might instead interact with other quarks. For example, in supersymmetric models, the Higgs-like state is produced in association with b-quarks.

Our results also extend to scenarios where a fraction of nodes can be Byzantine, deviating arbitrarily from their expected behavior. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n**Keywords:** Sensor Networks; Distributed Consensus; Local Information Exchange; Robustness Analysis. \n\n1. **Introduction**\nDistributed consensus plays a crucial role in various applications such as flocking, formation control, multi-agent coordination, and wireless sensor networks. A classic problem in this domain is the consensus problem, where a set of n nodes, connected via a communication graph, each holds some initial value \\( x_i(0) \\), and the aim is for them to compute the average value \\( \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(0) \\). This problem was studied by Tsitsiklis et al., who showed that if all nodes are connected according to a fixed directed graph, then consensus can be achieved using a straightforward iterative procedure. However, this assumption does not always hold since the underlying network graphs can be dynamic. In recent years, several researchers have explored the design of distributed consensus algorithms for dynamic networks. For instance, Olfati-Saber examined cases where the connectivity among nodes changes according to independent Bernoulli processes. Under specific connectivity assumptions, she demonstrated that her algorithm converges almost surely to the desired average. Later, Jadbabaie and colleagues extended these findings to undirected networks. More recently, researchers have continued to build on this foundation.",

        "rewrite_text": "We enhance the understanding of orbital magnetization (OM) through spin-orbit coupling in a kagome lattice featuring chiral magnetic interactions, which emerge as a property of the system at low temperatures. We demonstrate that the OM can be expressed in terms of the Berry curvature related to the electronic bands near the Fermi level. The strength of the OM is highly dependent on the arrangement of the spins and the orientation of the kagome lattice. Notably, when an external magnetic field is applied along one of the three equivalent <111> directions, we observe two distinct transitions in the temperature dependence of the OM. These findings suggest that the OM can provide valuable insights into the nature of the ordered state in this material.\n\nIntroduction: Orbital magnetization (OM), also referred to as orbital polarization or orbital moment density, has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. It arises from the influence of spin-orbit coupling and plays significant roles in various phenomena, including topological insulators, anomalous Hall effect, and superconductivity. Recently, OM has been detected in several materials such as SrRuO3, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, YbMgGaO4, and FeSe. In this work, we explore the case of OM in a frustrated antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice. This type of magnetic ordering can be seen in materials like Herbertsmithite, ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, and CuFeO2. However, these compounds generally exhibit relatively weak spin-orbit couplings compared to other materials with strong spin-orbit interactions. Therefore, they do not manifest significant amounts of OM. Conversely, recently discovered iron-based pnictide/chalcogenide compounds exhibit strong spin interactions, but their magnetic structures remain less understood. Thus, our theoretical framework offers valuable insights into possible experimental realizations.",

The Yukawa couplings, which link the Higgs boson to fermion masses, are critical in this context, as are the CKM mixing matrix and the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) framework. In the KM matrix, there are two important parameters: one that leads to CP violation and another known as the Jarlskog invariant, defined as J = Im(V_ud V^*_{ub}) / (Re V_ud Im V_{ub}). To explain the observed CP violation in K meson decays, we require at least one additional parameter in the KM framework. However, we notice that there are only four real parameters in the Yukawa coupling matrices, indicating that we cannot uniquely determine all elements of the KM matrix.

This situation is relevant when the shell's thickness fluctuates significantly across its radius, and the load is not necessarily axisymmetric. We demonstrate that in this context, it is possible to obtain robust solutions using only two parameters instead of three, as previously assumed; the key parameter being the ratio of the maximum to the minimum thickness of the shell. Our formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without resorting to complex equations or extensive numerical integration. This makes our approach more efficient than previous methods while maintaining high accuracy. Our technique can be applied to analyze the behavior of the Earth's crust in response to tectonic forces and other phenomena, including volcanic activity and sediment deposition. Additionally, it has applications in geophysics beyond Earth science, influencing fields like astrophysics and seismology. \n\nIn conjunction with studying the deformation of the Earth’s crust, it is essential to understand how stress distributes across various regions of the planet. We focus particularly on the evolution of stress in plate boundary environments, such as subduction zones and transform faults. To investigate these dynamics, we apply elasticity theory, aiming to explore the interactions between tectonic plates and their underlying structures. However, solving these problems analytically necessitates certain simplifications regarding the geometry involved and the mechanical properties of the materials. A significant simplification in the mechanics of plate boundaries is the assumption that they behave as thin elastic materials. This approach has been shown to provide reasonable approximations of more complex models of plate boundaries, permitting rapid calculations of the stress fields they experience. \n\nFor example, Figure 1 illustrates a comparison between displacements predicted by a thin shell model and those derived from a finite element analysis of the San Andreas Fault system.

We find that the rate at which reactants are consumed is influenced by the geometry of the fractal structure, characterized by a time-dependent fractal dimension \\( D(t) \\) that evolves according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution to this problem depends on the initial conditions and can be solved numerically using standard methods. Notably, we observe that if the initial concentration is localized, the system reaches equilibrium after a characteristic time \\( t^* \\). For times greater than \\( t^* \\), the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial conditions and aligns with the predictions made by classical diffusion theories. This finding suggests that the dynamics of reactions in fractal geometries can be effectively described by models that rely solely on geometrical properties.",

Specifically, our findings indicate that: 1) resilient nodes play a crucial role in decreasing the number of infected nodes as well as the total number of interactions between susceptible and infected nodes; 2) resilient nodes should be positioned strategically within MANETs; 3) efforts should not only focus on quarantining infected nodes but also on isolating susceptible nodes; 4) quarantine measures should aim to simultaneously utilize both protective and isolating strategies to effectively combat infections; and 5) dynamic quarantine measures are preferable to static ones, as static quarantines can lead to unnecessary disruptions of legitimate network traffic.",

        "rewrite_text": "We explore the gauge invariance properties of the effective theory derived from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, such as quarks and gluons, in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Our findings indicate that this effective theory is not generally invariant under gauge transformations unless specific conditions are met. These results have significant implications for constructing gauge-invariant observables in supersymmetric gauge theories. They also illuminate why it is challenging to formulate nontrivial superpotentials, despite the fact that supersymmetry prohibits any leading terms in the tree-level potential. Furthermore, we suggest that our results can help explain some puzzling features observed in recent lattice simulations of N = 1 supersymmetric QCD with four flavors. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are crucial in both theoretical physics and practical applications. Their low-energy behavior is described by an effective action that incorporates all relevant corrections from integrating over heavy fields like quarks and gluons. This effective action has been extensively studied, yet many questions remain regarding its precise behavior. A particular issue is whether this action maintains gauge invariance. It was previously established that integrating out only fermionic degrees of freedom yields a gauge-invariant effective action. However, counterexamples arise when considering the integration of bosonic degrees of freedom, leading to the potential breakdown of gauge invariance. Recently, this issue has gained renewed interest due to its significance for understanding non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories. In this work, we systematically examine the gauge invariance properties using functional techniques. Our main result shows that the effective action remains gauge invariant up to total derivatives, provided two conditions are satisfied. First, there should be no time-derivative terms acting on the gauge fields. Second, the parameters in the various operators in the effective action must satisfy certain constraints, which include dependence on the gauge coupling constant \\( g \\). If either of these conditions is violated, the effective action may lose gauge invariance.",

We find that electron trajectories can be confined to narrow channels when their initial velocities are directed oppositely along the field lines. This phenomenon arises from interference between two types of motion—the classical cyclotron orbits and the so-called Zitterbewegung oscillations—leading to a unique beating pattern that emerges from classical physics principles. The resulting dynamics are noteworthy due to the relativistic nature of the particles, with the consequences being evident in their spin splitting. Our findings provide a new perspective for understanding the physics underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall states at high Landau levels.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION  \nThe transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems of fermions in strong perpendicular magnetic fields have been extensively studied over the years. Notably, it has been established that the presence of a quantizing magnetic field leads to novel phases characterized by fractional quantum Hall effects, where the quantization of Landau levels deviates from classical predictions. In this work, we focus on the behavior of non-relativistic fermions moving in a 2D plane subjected to a uniform magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{e}_z \\). For clarity, we will consider only one spin species; however, our results remain valid if both spin projections are taken into account. Additionally, we assume that the Fermi level lies within the conduction band. Under these conditions, the low-energy excitations around the Fermi surface can be effectively described by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian, where \\( v_F \\) represents the Fermi velocity, \\( \\sigma_i \\) are the Pauli matrices acting on the spinor wave function \\( \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\), with \\( \\partial_x \\) and \\( \\partial_y \\) denoting the partial derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates.

Then, we express the objective function of the problem as a linear combination of polynomials in V . Finally, we formulate the problem as a system of polynomial equations by requiring that all points corresponding to feasible solutions satisfy the objective function simultaneously. As examples, we apply our technique to three well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: Maximum Clique, Minimum Vertex Cover, and Maximum Independent Set.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present our findings on the very weak electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films that were fabricated on SrTiO3 substrates using Jarvis laser deposition. This observation aligns with previous reports. Our measurements indicate that EPC decreases as temperature rises, reaching up to 300 K. This trend can be attributed to the expansion of the lattice due to disorder fluctuations occurring at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, we noted that the magnitude of EPC is significantly influenced by the film thickness; it diminishes as the thickness is reduced to 10 nanometers. The dependence of EPC on both temperature and film thickness suggests that phonon behavior plays a crucial role in mediating EPC in these films. Manganese oxides have been the subject of extensive research due to their fascinating properties, such as colossal magnetoresistance, half-metallicity, and charge ordering. Among these materials, La1-xSrxMnO3 has garnered particular attention since its discovery. In this compound, Mn ions occupy two distinct sites: Mn3+ (in tetrahedral coordination) and Mn4+ (in octahedral coordination). It has been observed that the magnetic state transitions from ferromagnetic insulator to antiferromagnetic insulator with varying doping levels. These phenomena can be attributed to the competition between double exchange interactions and superexchange mechanisms. However, there remain unresolved questions regarding the electronic states in these compounds, particularly concerning the mechanisms underlying their insulating behavior, which are still debated in the literature.",

        "rewrite_text": "We propose that the set of all univariate polynomials with integer coefficients can be uniquely represented as sums of squares of rational functions. Furthermore, we establish a framework for computing such representations. We also explore how to extend this result to multivariate polynomials over finite fields. The issue of representing a nonnegative polynomial as a sum of squares (SOS) has been extensively studied since Hilbert's work in the early 20th century on quadratic forms. Notably, Artin demonstrated that every nonnegative polynomial can be represented as a sum of four squares of integers. This implies that any positive integer \\( n \\) can be expressed as a sum of at most four square roots of integers. However, there are infinitely many ways to represent any integer as a sum of two or three square roots. For instance, \\( 1 \\) can be expressed as \\( 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\) and also as \\( 2 - \\sqrt{3} \\). The question of uniqueness becomes more intriguing when we focus on polynomials. It turns out that if \\( f \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\) is a monic polynomial whose Galois group \\( G(f) \\) is solvable, then \\( f \\) can be uniquely represented as an SOS. Conversely, if \\( G(f) \\) is not solvable, then \\( f \\) may have multiple SOS representations.",

Additionally, various types of input mechanisms can be utilized. This article discusses several methods for designing a slide-o-cam transmission, analyzing its kinematic properties. This analysis led to the development of two prototypes designed for use in electric vehicles.

We analyze data from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO survey to determine the projected correlation function, wp(rp). The observed clustering is consistent with predictions derived from current cosmological models. This result provides important constraints on these models at this redshift range, where there are few other available data points. Additionally, we find evidence for evolution in the galaxy bias parameter between our two samples, amounting to approximately 0.2 Gyrs. Detailed findings will be presented in a separate publication. \n\nKeywords: Luminous Red Galaxies; Clustering; Bias Evolution; Cosmology. \n\n1. Introduction\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that luminous red galaxies (LRGs), selected through their optical properties or near-infrared photometry, serve as powerful probes for large-scale structure research extending to high redshifts (e.g., Eisenstein et al. 2001; Wake et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2007; Blake et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2008). Their high luminosities allow for their detection even at relatively low redshifts, while their red colors facilitate spectroscopic identification. LRGs predominantly reside in massive matter halos that evolve slowly over time, making them excellent tracers of the underlying mass distribution. Thus, they present unique opportunities to study both the growth of cosmic structures and the dynamics of cosmic expansion (see e.g., Percival & White 2009, for a relevant discussion). In this work, we report our measurements of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs in the redshift range 0 < z < 0.8, utilizing a combination of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) (Colless et al.).",

A total of 50 consecutive patients underwent US-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy utilizing an in-room C-arm system for real-time guidance. The procedure was carried out under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation. Prior to the procedure, a CT scan was performed without intravenous contrast. Using OsiriX MD software, two urologists outlined the kidney's contours and identified all accessible calices. They subsequently projected their findings onto the fluoroscopic screen during the procedure, focusing on puncturing each calyx that was visible on fluoroscopy. Following successful puncture, stone removal was attempted through the sheath via the needle. A successful puncture was defined as the ability to access at least one calyx. The overall success rate was 88%, with no complications attributed to the use of the US puncture tract projections. This technique allows urologists to perform safe and effective percutaneous renal procedures, even when only a few calices are clearly visible on fluoroscopy.",

Our analysis reveals that these problems are equivalent to Lie reductions of the three-wave resonant equations.

Notably, we find that there are no non-trivial solutions of the linearized PIII or PV that exhibit exponential decay at infinity when certain conditions are applied to their asymptotic behavior near the origin. \n\nIntroduction: The Painlevé equations are significant in both mathematics and physics (see, e.g., references 1 and 4). They have been extensively studied in recent years due to their intricate structures, including soliton solutions and Bäcklund transformations. Recently, it has been demonstrated that they arise in various models relevant to nonlinear optics. For example, the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with cubic-quintic nonlinearity emerges from laser dynamics through Kerr effects. In this article, we address the linearization problem for multiple types of Painlevé equations. Specifically, we focus on the partial differential equations where \\( RS = R(t, x) \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \\), and \\( v = v(t, x) \\) and \\( w = w(t, x) \\) are vector-valued functions of \\( t > 0 \\) and \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^1 \\).

They play a vital role in various fields, including particle mechanics, optics, and biophysics. Recently, interest has surged in developing efficient methods for computing NESs due to their significance in applications where it may not always be feasible or straightforward to obtain solutions. For instance, in molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo methods, only approximations of NESs are typically available. Furthermore, even if the exact solution were known, its direct computation could still lead to significant computational challenges. Hence, it is essential to develop fast and accurate algorithms for calculating NESs. Numerous approaches exist for numerically approximating NESs, including eigenvector methods, power iteration, and Krylov subspace techniques. These methods often involve repeated application of the original master equation until convergence is achieved. However, since the number of...",

        "rewrite_text": "This study examines the effects of quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the decoherence of semiconductor-based qubit systems. The QED interactions are represented by a coupling between the qubit and its surroundings, which includes electromagnetic field fluctuations manifesting as thermal photons at finite temperatures. We find that these QED interactions can be treated perturbatively under typical experimental conditions. Notably, the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free modes increases with the number of electrons (N) involved in the qubit state. This leads to shorter relaxation times (T1) but results in stronger pure dephasing (T2). For realistic values of N, ranging from 10 to 100, the effects of QED are relatively minor compared to other decoherence sources like phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions. \n\nQuantum information processing has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in various fields, from quantum computing to metrology. Semiconductor-based qubit devices have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computers. Among these, excitonic states in semiconductors are particularly vital for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, exciton-exciton interactions can lead to rapid decoherence, making it challenging to maintain coherence in each device. To address this issue, several recent proposals have suggested hybrid structures combining different materials. In this letter, we investigate how the principle of electrodynamic (or radiative) coupling affects the dynamics of semiconductor-based qubit systems. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), we consider two primary types of electromagnetic field fluctuations around the qubit: first, fluctuations within the cavity leading to the spontaneous emission of excitons into free modes; and second, the presence of thermal photons.",

Our primary objective is to identify the optimal set of parameters that characterize external periodic forcing, thereby maximizing the growth rate of plankton populations. We propose that this optimization challenge can be reduced to solving a set of algebraic equations. Specifically, we demonstrate that there is a unique solution corresponding to the maximum value of the objective function. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the derived solutions are robust against perturbations of the initial conditions. Finally, numerical simulations support our theoretical conclusions. \n\nKeywords: Stochastic differential equations, Periodic forcing, Resonance, Optimization problem, Nonlinear dynamics\n\n1 Introduction\nInteractions between different species play a crucial role in many natural ecosystems. For example, phytoplankton (algae or plants), which sit at the base of aquatic food webs, serve as a primary food source for organisms like zooplankton (fish or animals). Therefore, understanding the dynamics between these two populations provides valuable insights into ecosystem functioning. Recently, various Lies models have been developed to characterize the population dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton interactions. These models incorporate deterministic components representing the natural growth rates of both populations and their mutual interactions, as well as stochastic fluctuations due to environmental factors. It has been shown that under specific conditions, the long-term behavior of these systems can exhibit chaotic attractors, complicating the analysis of the dynamics. Conversely, neglecting the influence of random fluctuations renders the resulting deterministic equations challenging to investigate.

These findings suggest that the majority of supermassive black holes have masses ranging from \\(10^6 M_\\odot\\) to \\(10^9 M_\\odot\\). This poses serious challenges for current theories of black hole formation, as they typically predict smaller masses for the central black holes. One potential solution to this issue could be found in supermassive active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that feature black holes surrounded by an accretion disk. If the density within the disk is sufficiently high, the dynamics of the black hole can cause the infalling matter to flow through viscous processes. As a result, the matter falling towards the black hole forms a geometrically thin accretion disk. However, if the density falls below a certain threshold, the disk may break up or even fragment into clumps. Such instabilities can lead to the formation of large-scale structures.",

A fundamental challenge in data compression is accurately predicting the size of the compressed file compared to the original uncompressed data. This issue is commonly known as rate-distortion analysis. It has been established that the rate-distortion function describes the relationship between the length of the encoded codewords and the distortion incurred by any given encoding method. The most commonly used approach for tackling the rate-constrained optimization problem is Lagrangian relaxation, which converts constrained optimization into an unconstrained form through the introduction of Lagrange multipliers. However, solving these problems typically requires iterative methods that can be computationally intensive. To address this challenge, researchers have developed faster algorithms. Nonetheless, these methods often still face significant limitations when applied to practical scenarios.",

The geometry is assumed to be asymptotically flat, while matter fields are confined to our four-dimensional brane. We propose that this framework can explain the observed flatness of galactic rotation curves without necessitating any additional dark matter or fine-tuning of energy density. Specifically, we illustrate how the mass distributions within galaxies may effectively serve as a reflection of the geometry of spacetime. This research was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456728. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.Cq. A fundamental question regarding dark matter has been whether it consists of one or more types of particles. If so, what are their masses? How do they interact with ordinary matter? How much dark matter is present in each galaxy? These inquiries drive us to develop models in which dark matter is represented by some field that interacts with a warped spacetime manifold. Here, we focus on a class of models where the extra dimension is compactified on a circle \\( S^1 \\). Such models were previously studied, where it was shown that if the radius of the compactification is small compared to other scales, then the potential experienced by particles on the brane is indistinguishable from that generated by a point-like source located at the center of the sphere. However, as the size of the compact dimension approaches the brane's curvature radius, the gravitational effects become significant. In earlier work, Randall and Sundrum demonstrated that such scenarios could provide an elegant explanation for the hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. They proposed a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with two three-dimensional branes located at its boundaries—one representing our universe and the other acting as a mirror.

The observed velocities of the HVSs can be explained if they were ejected between 0.5 and 1 billion years ago on nearly radial paths with eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.9. This aligns with previous unpublished findings regarding the time frame during which dynamical friction causes the orbital characteristics of stars to transition into the corresponding regions of galaxies. \n\n**Keywords**: High-velocity stars, supermassive black holes, galaxies, ejection mechanisms, dynamical friction, halo dynamics.\n\n**Introduction**: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs; Brown et al., 2007a; Kenyon et al., 2008) are defined as stars that possess velocities exceeding 500 km/s relative to their local standard of rest.

This issue arises in various contexts such as biological processes, molecular dynamics, and granular gases. Here, we focus on the two-species conservative symmetric exclusion process (TCSEP), which consists of two types of indistinguishable particles, A and B, that move according to specific rules: Particles A and B independently traverse a ring of L sites by shifting to adjacent empty spaces. If both particle types attempt to occupy the same site simultaneously, either the A particle advances while the B particle remains where it is, or vice versa, depending on which type is more plentiful. It is important to note that this mechanism conserves the number of each particle type separately, but not the total number of particles \\(N = n_A + n_B\\). Thus, the dynamics of the TCSEP can be described by a master equation.",

The emission line from the QDs splits into two lines with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to approximately 1 T, corresponding to a Zeeman energy shift of about 0.5 meV at 4 K. We observe that this shift increases linearly as the temperature decreases to 20 mK, then saturates below 10 mK. This phenomenon can be explained by considering both electron localization effects and phonon-assisted transitions between different excitonic states within the QDs. Our studies indicate that the spin relaxation time for electrons confined in the QDs is on the order of 100 ns, even in high magnetic fields up to 5 T. Quantum dots, which are semiconductor nanocrystals or artificial atoms, offer numerous advantages due to their unique properties, such as size-tunable band gaps, strong light-matter interaction, and large oscillator strengths. These characteristics make QDs suitable as building blocks for various optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors. Notably, significant research has been conducted on the spin dynamics of charge carriers in QDs. It has been demonstrated that carriers are remarkably stable against decoherence from repetitive interactions. However, the spin relaxation times can vary depending on external factors. In particular, the spin lifetimes of holes and electrons confined in QDs have been reported to be several nanoseconds with pulsed excitation. In contrast, the spin lifetimes of electrons and holes in QDs can reach microseconds when using continuous wave laser excitation instead.",

In addition to the point source at the location of the pulsar, there is evidence of diffuse emission surrounding it.

However, it has been demonstrated that, within classical physics, it is impossible to create a consistent theory under such conditions due to ultraviolet divergences. This issue was addressed by Snyder, who introduced a specific type of coordinate transformation leading to a deformed Poincaré algebra. In addition to investigations into effects associated with minimal length scales, several researchers have proposed models where the commutator between two spatial coordinates, [x_i, x_j] = iθ_ij, depends on some parameters θ_ij. Such deformations alter the standard dispersion relations and significantly affect the properties of matter fields. Recently, it has been suggested that incorporating a minimal length scale into the framework of gravitational theories could help resolve the black hole information paradox. An intriguing avenue of exploration is the possibility that the deformation parameter θ_ij can be adjusted such that its magnitude diminishes rapidly with increasing distance. Consequently, the effects of noncommutativity may become negligible outside a finite region surrounding the gravitational source. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the noncommutativity of spacetime potentially affects only localized phenomena while leaving global structures unchanged.",

We find that both of these factors can introduce significant uncertainties when deriving cosmological constraints from observed scaling relations. Specifically, we note the following: (i) The scatter in the mass-temperature (M-T) relation is influenced by temperature-dependent selection effects, with this effect being more pronounced in low-mass clusters. (ii) The form of the luminosity-mass (L-M) relation is highly dependent on whether cooling flows are included in the analysis, as cool cores are more prevalent in high-mass clusters, leading to a steepening of the relation when they are taken into account. (iii) The normalization of the Y-X-ray luminosity-temperature relation exhibits strong redshift dependence, which can be attributed to selection effects related to self-similar scaling.",

Our observations reveal that the visibility of the interference fringes diminishes as the number of atoms detected at one output port of the beam splitter increases. This effect can be understood in terms of how repeated measurements influence the state of the system being observed. Our results demonstrate the capability of atom interferometry to explore fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics posits that any attempt to measure a quantum quantity will inevitably disturb its value. In this study, we experimentally investigate such phenomena in a Bose-Einstein condensate by employing Ramsey interferometry between two spatially separated regions of our sample. By allowing the atoms to evolve freely after a portion of the initial cloud is separated, we can control the dynamics during this evolution. Following recombination, we measure the distribution of atoms arriving at each output port of the beam splitter and analyze their time-dependent behavior.

First, we revisit some notations and definitions from Santos and RBI that are used throughout the text. We define what it means for two points on an n-dimensional manifold M to be close together (in terms of geodesic distance) or far apart. We also introduce the notion of a local chart at each point in M, which enables us to describe nearby points by relating their coordinates to those of other points using these charts. Finally, we provide a brief overview of how one can construct a local coordinate system around a given point using parallel transport along curves in M. The second section discusses the realization of a vector field X defined over the entire manifold M. This is achieved by defining a function F: TM → R, where TM is the tangent bundle of M. We show that if X satisfies certain properties, then there exists a unique smooth function f: M → R such that X = grad(f), where grad(f) denotes the gradient of f. For instance, if M is a surface embedded in R³, then X can represent the velocity of a particle moving across M. If we assume that the motion follows Newton's laws, then the function f corresponds to the potential energy of the particle in a conservative field.

Our findings reveal universal features that are independent of microscopic details such as the initial state or external parameters. We observe that the system evolves into a stationary state characterized by persistent density-density correlations at all distances. The time scale of these correlations is set by a single parameter, which we associate with the inverse temperature of the equilibrium state. This allows us to extract the temperature directly from experimental data without the need for fitting parameters.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK** The advancements in trapping and manipulating ultracold atomic gases have opened new avenues for studying strongly correlated quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium. Specifically, experiments have shown how these systems can evolve into different quantum states while being driven out of equilibrium by changes in external control parameters. In this work, we examine the case where the system is rapidly quenched across a phase transition. For instance, if the gas was initially confined in a potential trap, it will freely expand once the confining potential is removed. Alternatively, the system could be prepared in a specific state before a rapid change in another parameter (e.g., a magnetic field). In both scenarios, the relaxation dynamics will significantly depend on whether the system started close to equilibrium. If it did, the system typically relaxes into a metastable state whose properties cannot be directly inferred from those of the original equilibrium state.",

Secondly, unlike string/M-theory or loop quantum gravity, our new model does not require additional dimensions that have not been experimentally validated. Thirdly, we demonstrate how our dual framework can be utilized to derive Einstein's general relativity. Finally, we show that our approach can also lead to the derivation of Maxwell's equations.\n\nIn recent years, there have been numerous attempts to formulate a Theory of Everything (TOE). String theory and loop quantum gravity are notable examples, yet they each face significant challenges. For instance, string theory necessitates the existence of extra dimensions, while loop quantum gravity grapples with issues related to renormalizability. These challenges motivate us to seek alternative approaches to developing TOEs. A novel proposal suggests that spacetime is emergent in nature, stemming from a more fundamental substrate. \n\nThe concept of emergent spacetime is straightforward: it posits that spacetime itself is not a fundamental entity, but rather emerges from deeper physical principles. To illustrate this idea, consider yourself sitting on a couch watching the scenery around you. You might perceive your immediate surroundings as flat, but if you were to stand up, you would recognize that the ground is curved. Now, picture yourself suspended above Earth. Standing up in this scenario, you would no longer feel as though you were on a flat surface, but rather on a distorted landscape defined by a more complex structure.",

INTRODUCTION**\nIn numerous applications, accurately determining the position where a photon impacts a detector is crucial, particularly in the design of optical instruments like telescopes. To ascertain the spatial resolution of a detector, it is essential to have reference points against which we can compare experimental data. One effective method to establish these reference points is to use a known light source that emits photons at a specified angle relative to the detector's surface. If the detector lacks intrinsic spatial resolution, photons will arrive from a broad area surrounding the point on the detector surface. By shifting the detector through various angles, we can determine what percentage of the total count originates from different sections of the detector, which we refer to as the response function R(θ). Understanding the characteristics of this response function allows us to evaluate the spatial resolution of the detector. However, if multiple pixels exist within a single angular range, the situation becomes complex, as multiple pixels might detect the same photon. To address this challenge, we propose a new metric—the joint probability P_ij—that quantifies the likelihood of the i-th and j-th pixels detecting a photon simultaneously. Utilizing this concept alongside the response function, we can further analyze the detector's capabilities.",

We demonstrate how QPD can serve as a source for gravitational field equations derived from Hamilton's principle of least action. The resulting equations closely resemble those derived from Einstein's equations; however, unlike Einstein's equations, our proposed field equations do not include any free parameters, such as the cosmological constant or dark matter. This means that all physical phenomena governed by these two frameworks should yield consistent results if they are based on the same underlying principles.

        "rewrite_text": "We propose that electroweak symmetry breaking is initiated by strong dynamics at an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, as indicated by gauge-Higgs unification models involving warped extra dimensions. We illustrate how these frameworks can be realized within the context of composite Higgs models based on strongly coupled gauge theories. Specifically, we present two distinct scenarios: one in which the Higgs emerges as a Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries; and another where it appears as a bound state of fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The former scenario can lead to new avenues for Higgs production via gluon fusion, which could be observable at future colliders. Additionally, we explore the implications of these scenarios for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification offers a compelling rationale for why the weak scale is significantly smaller than other mass scales. Furthermore, it provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the Planck and TeV scales, as radiative corrections to the Higgs potential are suppressed at the UV limit. However, several challenges must be addressed to implement this idea practically: i) the Higgs should be naturally embedded within some strongly coupled sector; ii) its couplings to Standard Model particles must align with experimental observations; iii) there should be a mechanism for generating masses for all Standard Model fields without introducing significant hierarchies among them. These challenges have been tackled recently using the Randall-Sundrum framework, where the Higgs resides on the infrared brane while gravity propagates in the bulk. This setup allows for a calculable framework of Higgs physics but introduces complications due to the presence of Kaluza-Klein gravitons.",

The rate at which these reactions occur depends on how much fuel (i.e., helium) there is available to burn.

At this point, helium begins burning rapidly, releasing large amounts of energy into the surrounding plasma.  This causes the outer layers of the star to expand outward as they are pushed away by the increased pressure generated within the core.  Eventually, the expanding outer layers become so thin that they can no longer support themselves against gravity;  the star then collapses back onto itself, forming a white dwarf or neutron star.

        "rewrite_text": "We address the challenge of quantizing a Jurassic vector within a Grassmannian manifold to minimize distortion while adhering to a rate constraint, specifically for fused-input, linear-output (MIMO) communication systems with limited feedback. By employing information-theoretic methods such as entropy power inequalities and data processing inequalities, we derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum achievable distortion and the optimal rate. Our findings indicate that the gap between these bounds tends to widen as the size of the underlying Grassmannian manifold increases. Additionally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate our theoretical insights. This research was supported by NSF Grant CCF-0635035. Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems are widely utilized in wireless networks due to their high spectral efficiency. Recent work has shown that limited-rate feedback can enhance performance, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, available feedback resources are often constrained in practical scenarios. To mitigate the burden of feedback while maintaining performance, one approach involves exploiting channel state information (CSI), which refers to the knowledge of the current channel state, to perform joint encoding across multiple transmit antennas. This technique, commonly known as spatial multiplexing or beamforming, necessitates CSI availability at both the transmitter and receiver ends. Since obtaining perfect CSI at the transmitter typically requires training-based methods, practical applications often rely on quantized versions of the actual CSI. Consequently, a trade-off arises between the quality of the transmitted signals and the amount of feedback needed. The design of efficient transmission strategies over MIMO channels with limited feedback is an active area of research. Numerous studies have focused on characterizing fundamental limits associated with various MIMO communication scenarios, particularly concerning CSI availability. For instance, some research considers situations where only partial feedback about the channel is available.",

        "rewrite_text": "The unexpectedly small value of the cosmological constant is one of the most perplexing challenges in modern physics. It has been proposed that this issue might be addressed through the effects of quantum gravity on vacuum fluctuations. In this study, we explore how these concepts can be integrated within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We analyze a scenario where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG, while matter fields are treated classically. The resulting equations contain terms that depend on both the spatial geometry and its time derivatives. These terms lead to modifications of the standard Friedmann equations at high energy levels. By combining these modified equations with observational data, we find that our model for the energy density aligns well with observations, provided that the initial conditions are suitably chosen. This suggests that our approach offers a compelling resolution to the cosmological constant problem. The smallness of the cosmological constant remains one of the most significant puzzles in contemporary theoretical physics. It is widely believed that quantum gravity will be crucial in explaining why the energy density associated with vacuum fluctuations is much smaller than expected. Various attempts have been made to tackle this problem within loop quantum gravity, yet none have produced a satisfactory solution. In particular, the results from several references show inconsistencies among each other and with current experimental limits. Here, we propose a new approach based on recent developments. Our key insight lies in recognizing that the Wheeler-DeWitt equations derived from the canonical formulation of general relativity reduce to the Schrödinger equation under certain conditions applied to macroscopic states. As demonstrated in previous work, these equations can lead to significant corrections due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom connected to the gravitational field itself.",

In particular we apply our method to two different sets of pulse : 1 ) A sample of RR Lyrae stars observed towards the Galactic bulge ; 2 ) Gravitational lensing fox towards the Bullet Cluster . Our fox are compared against previous works using paused clarity but assuming either constant anisotropies across all radii or child power - law radial dependences . We child that these backyard lead to Martin biases when Jurassic the data .",
        "rewrite_text": "In this study, we introduce an energy-efficient cooperative transmission signal for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Our approach combines collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relays. By utilizing channel state information (CSI) feedback from all relays, the source can adjust its transmit power based on real-time CSI to maximize overall performance while meeting quality of service requirements. We begin by deriving expressions for power allocation between the source and each relay under various conditions. Utilizing these expressions, we then formulate the problem of maximizing the WSN's throughput subject to minimum data rate constraints into a convex optimization problem that can be solved numerically. Finally, we present simulation results that validate our analysis and demonstrate that substantial gains can be achieved through the application of our proposed method.",

We have studied the correlation between the total power of the diffuse radio emission and other physical parameters such as X-ray luminosity, temperature and mass for a sample of 25 galaxy clusters observed by GMRT. The main result is that we find evidence for two different populations of radio halo sources which are separated by their radio powers. In particular, our analysis shows that there exists an upper limit to the radio power of radio halos hosted by massive galaxy clusters. This suggests that the energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the synchrotron emission decreases rapidly beyond this threshold value. Our findings also suggest that the magnetic field strength increases with increasing radio power. These results can be explained within the framework of the re-acceleration model where secondary electrons produced through hadronic interactions are reaccelerated by turbulence generated during mergers or accretion events.",

        "rewrite_text": "We propose to explore the concept of Maxwell's demon in relation to how nanodevices can be utilized for storage or transmission in practical applications. We believe this exploration is valuable as it allows us to understand why some devices outperform others in these tasks. Specifically, we analyze two types of nanodevices recently identified as candidates for quantum computing: spin qubits and arrays of coupled cavities. The first type involves a system of spins aligned with nearest neighbor interactions, while the second type employs atoms trapped within optical cavities. For both scenarios, we evaluate their efficiency using the Landauer principle. Additionally, we discuss potential experimental implementations of our ideas. \n\nIntroduction: The idea of Maxwell's demon was introduced by James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) and describes a theoretical intelligent being capable of manipulating microscopic particles so that they can move into separate chambers based on whether they possess high or low energies. This concept is typically framed as a thought experiment aimed at illustrating that entropy does not spontaneously decrease. However, an alternative interpretation of Maxwell's demon suggests the existence of a device that can sort individual particles according to their velocities. This brings us to the question of what kinds of physical systems could function as such a device.",
