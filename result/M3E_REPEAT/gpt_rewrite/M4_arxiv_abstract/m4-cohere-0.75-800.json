It has previously been shown that EP violations can occur within general relativity involving specific gravitons. Here, we examine the validity of the EP in theories that extend beyond Einstein's framework, where additional degrees of freedom exist. Our analysis focuses on two categories of models: scalar-tensor theories, including Brans-Dicke theory, and string-inspired models. In these frameworks, dilatons and/or axions serve as additional degrees of freedom alongside gravitons. Dilatons couple directly to photons, while axions do so indirectly through interactions with photons and gluons. These couplings lead to potential violations of the EP. In scalar-tensor theories, for example, the photon gains a mass term proportional to the scalar field's gradient.

        "rewrite_text": "We present the findings of our study on gravitational wave (GW) foregrounds for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Our primary focus is on double white dwarf binaries, which are anticipated to be significant sources of GW in terms of their density and event rate. Specifically, we examine how their properties are influenced by the initial conditions at formation, as well as by factors such as nuclear interactions and orbital dynamics resulting from gravitational wave emission. This investigation was conducted using detailed numerical simulations, incorporating a version of the Eggleton code that accounts for general relativistic effects. \n\nOur key conclusions are as follows: \n\n1. We discovered that the detectability of gravitational waves within a specific volume is highly sensitive to the assumed distribution of binary parameters, such as the mass ratio \\( q = M_2 / M_1 \\) and the total binary mass \\( M_{\\text{tot}} = M_1 + M_2 \\). This sensitivity is significant because varying distributions lead to markedly different fractions of binaries aligned favorably with the detector's line of sight. If all binaries are randomly oriented, only about 10% will generate signals above the detectable threshold. Conversely, if they are preferentially oriented face-on, this fraction can increase to 50%. Therefore, it is critically important to determine the actual orientation distributions of these quantities through observations before making any predictions about the detectability of gravitational waves.\n\n2. We found a strong correlation between the masses of the two components in a double white dwarf binary. Consequently, a majority of the systems detected by LISA will consist of white dwarf binaries. However, despite the mass ratio being close to unity for many systems, there are still instances where one white dwarf is significantly less massive than its companion. These cases provide valuable insights into the physics of mergers, allowing us to investigate the low-mass binary regime through observations of these degenerate systems.",

Introduction \nPeriodic multilayers made from alternating thin films of different materials have garnered significant interest in recent years due to their unique properties. These include high reflectance, enhanced refraction, and nonlinear optical characteristics, making them promising candidates for a range of applications, including optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics. Recent studies have shown that multilayers composed of anisotropic materials can exhibit intriguing electromagnetic phenomena related to SWR. This phenomenon occurs when the Bloch wavenumber reaches zero within certain regions of the material. This manifests as an unusually high effective refractive index, \\( n_{\\text{eff}} = \\omega / v_{\\text{ph}} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency and \\( v_{\\text{ph}} \\) is the phase velocity of the propagating Bloch wave. Consequently, the transmission spectrum of the layers can exhibit narrow stop bands, which are highly relevant for various practical applications. Despite extensive research on SWR in multilayers, several fundamental questions remain regarding the conditions necessary for this phenomenon to occur. For instance, experimental studies have shown that even slight misalignment of anisotropic layers can disrupt the SWR, while numerical simulations suggest that...",

        "rewrite_text": "We introduce a project aimed at constructing reduced basis methods for nonlinear problems with multiple solutions, utilizing a technique based on the quasi-equilibrium grid (QEG). The QEG approach, originally developed by Simo and Armero, serves as a robust method for addressing rate-independent problems such as plasticity and damage mechanics. We suggest that this technique can effectively generate snapshots necessary for constructing the reduced basis associated with nonlinear phenomena exhibiting multiple solutions. Specifically, we present two examples derived from nonlinear problems and computational analyses. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method produces accurate approximations at significantly reduced computational costs compared to traditional methods. \n\n**Keywords:** Reduced Basis Method; Quasi-Equilibrium Grids; Nonlinear Problems; Model Order Reduction; Geometric Construction; Snapshot Generation.\n\n**1 Introduction**  \nThis study aims to develop efficient methods for generating snapshots that facilitate the construction of reduced basis (RB) methods for nonlinear problems exhibiting multiple solutions. Such challenges frequently arise in engineering applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex phenomena like multiphysics coupling, material failure, and contact mechanics. For instance, in certain nonlinear systems, variations in initial conditions can lead to distinct equilibrium states. Likewise, in various steady-state problems, diverse boundary conditions can yield multiple solutions. To effectively address these issues through the reduced basis method (RBM), it is crucial to create a comprehensive set of snapshots that encapsulate all potential solution behaviors. However, since each snapshot corresponds to a specific solution behavior, capturing them effectively via standard finite element analysis can be challenging. Consequently, innovative strategies have been developed over the past decade to address this difficulty.",

An edge e = (u, v) connects vertex u to vertex v, indicating that there is a direct connection between these nodes. If no such edge exists, then e is not included in E. A path P is defined as a sequence of vertices v1, v2, …, vn such that each pair of consecutive vertices is connected by an edge in E (i.e., vi−1vi ∈ E for i = 2, 3, …, n). A cycle C is a path where the first and last vertices are the same. A connected subgraph H of G is such that any two vertices in H can be connected by a path within H, while vertices outside of H cannot connect through it. A clique K is a complete subgraph of G, meaning every pair of vertices in K is connected by an edge. A k-clique is a specific type of clique that contains exactly k vertices. A vertex cover S is a subset of V such that every edge in G has at least one endpoint in S.",

        "rewrite_text": "We propose a method to cool fermionic atoms in optical lattices by utilizing the pairing susceptibility between two different hyperfine states, reminiscent of Cooper pair formation in superconductors. We believe that this technique can be applied to both bosonic and fermionic systems with considerable success. Our proposed method offers several advantages over traditional cooling techniques, such as evaporative cooling or sympathetic cooling. Notably, it does not require additional laser beams beyond those needed for trapping and manipulating the atoms. Furthermore, it is effective even when there are no free fermions present initially (e.g., at zero temperature). We will also discuss potential experimental implementations of our approach. Achieving low temperatures in fermionic systems below 1 microkelvin, nearing degeneracy, remains one of the most significant challenges in atomic physics. This task becomes even more difficult with high initial densities of fermions, as elastic collisions can lead to the loss of thermally excited atoms. However, in recent years, innovative techniques have been developed that allow us to trap and manipulate atoms with unprecedented precision. These advancements facilitate the exploration of many-body phenomena, such as superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation in ultracold atomic gases. A key objective in these experiments is to reach degenerate regimes featuring strongly interacting fermions. However, achieving low temperatures demands efficient cooling mechanisms. One promising avenue for attaining this goal is to leverage the pairing stability of fermions. Pairs of fermions can form bound states akin to Cooper pairs in superconductors. In a similar manner, pairs of fermions can manifest as bound states in ultracold atomic systems. If the interaction potential between the fermions is sufficiently strong, they will have a tendency to bind into pairs rather than remain unpaired. Consequently, cooling fermions through pairing should remain effective even in various experimental conditions.",

However, there remain fundamental questions about the dynamics of emergent phenomena that remain unresolved. In recent years, several researchers have sought to address these issues by applying concepts borrowed from statistical mechanics, such as entropy or free energy. These concepts were originally grounded in classical thermodynamics but have been recently adapted to the realm of quantum mechanics. Specifically, one can relate the von Neumann entropy \\( S = -Tr(\\rho \\ln \\rho) \\) to the density matrix \\( \\rho \\) that describes the state of a quantum system. This quantity measures the level of uncertainty inherent in measurement outcomes, and its time derivative \\( dS/dt \\) gives rise to the entropy production rate. It has been shown that this rate plays a crucial role in characterizing the irreversible behavior of quantum systems. Furthermore, if the entropy production rate is zero, the quantum system behaves reversibly. In contrast, a positive entropy production rate indicates that the system is undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics.",

The IRS spectrum reveals strong emission lines, including Ne II at 12.81 µm and S III at 18.71 µm, which are commonly observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We demonstrate that these emission lines can be modeled using photoionization simulations that employ AGN-like ionizing radiation fields. From the measured line ratios, we estimate the electron density (n_e) to be approximately 10^3 cm^{-3}, the temperature (T) to be around 1000 K, and the ionization parameter (U_H) to be 1 x 10^{-2}. These values indicate that the central region of NGC 3621 shares characteristics similar to those of Seyfert galaxies.

Introduction**\n\nMusic analysis and automatic transcription of musical pieces have posed significant challenges in computer science for many years. This process involves retrieving the underlying score of a musical piece from its audio data or MIDI representation. The task can be divided into two main subtasks: detecting note onset times and estimating the pitches of these notes. Note onset detection is typically accomplished by applying various heuristics to the raw audio data. After determining the onset times of the notes, the next step is to estimate the pitches associated with these notes. There are numerous strategies to tackle this problem, ranging from using known template matching techniques to more advanced machine learning models. In this paper, we concentrate on the second aspect—pitch estimation—also referred to as pitch tracking. Pitch tracking aims to assign a specific pitch value to each detected event in order to recreate a sequence of pitch values that correspond to the original score. A common method for representing pitch information is through pitch class profiles (PCPs), where each entry corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of a particular pitch within a defined time window.

Notably, we observe that the total energy transfer from larger to smaller scales decreases in the presence of significant mass particle feedback. This suggests that heavy particle interactions can enhance the efficiency of turbulent energy transfer. Additionally, we note that the effects of mass particle feedback become more pronounced with an increase in Stokes numbers or a larger initial volume fraction of particles. Our results offer valuable insights into the behavior of heavy particles within turbulent flow systems. \n\nAuthors: Yi-Chun Chen, Shih-Chieh Hwang, Chia-Hui Wu, Yu-Ting Lin, Ming-Yuan Liu, Chao-Lin Wang, Jie-Sheng Huang, Wen-Ju Tsai, Tzi-Chao Chan, Chin-Fa Lee, Kuo-Yang Chang, Chung-Ming Yeh, Yuan-Kang Chiou, Chien-Nan Chu, Cheng-Wei Hsieh, Chien-Wen Lu, Chien-Chung Wu, Chien-Shu Chen, Chien-Chin Wu, Chien-Chin Yang, Chien-Chin Lai, Chien-Chin Su, Chien-Chin Hung, Chien-Chin Chen, Chien-Ching Wu, Chien-Ching Tai, Chien-Ching Li, Chien-Ching Sun, Chien-Ching Liang, Chien-Ching Chen, Chien-Chong Wu, Chien-Chung Chen, Chien-Chung Lai, Chien-Chung Su, Chien-Chung Hung.",

Introduction**\n\nIn many applications, such as radar detection, sonar, or computer vision, there is a need to detect targets (e.g., aircraft) in environments with limited resources. For instance, in air traffic control, radar systems must track several aircraft simultaneously while minimizing false alarms caused by clutter. This task requires efficient resource allocation across various dimensions to optimize overall performance. A common approach in these problems involves scanning each target individually until a stopping criterion is reached. However, this method can lead to suboptimal outcomes since the best solution relies not only on current measurements but also on future observations. As a result, it is vital to explore ways to enhance the detection of these targets.\n\nPrevious research has made strides in addressing various aspects of target allocation in multi-target scenarios. Many studies focus on optimizing the detection process or improving the localization of targets. However, they often assume that target states are known with precision before any optimization occurs. In practice, the states of targets are rarely certain, as they are determined through noisy observations. This uncertainty can hinder the ability to achieve global optimality in real-world applications.\n\nTo counter this challenge, researchers have developed robust versions of classical target allocation methods. These approaches typically utilize formal frameworks to ensure that the resultant allocations remain feasible, even when true target states fluctuate.",

        "rewrite_text": "We emphasize that the effects of nonstandard interactions (NSI) between neutrinos and matter can be investigated using data from both solar and reactor neutrinos concurrently, particularly by examining their impact on the survival probability P (νe→νe). Our analysis indicates that NSI parameters are restricted to values below 0.1 for the majority of combinations of standard oscillation parameters that are allowed at the 3σ confidence level by current global fits. Notable constraints arise when combining datasets from solar experiments and KamLAND. In this scenario, we derive upper limits on |εee| and |εµτ|, which are found to be less than 0.06 to 0.07, depending on the value of θ13. These findings improve upon previous limits established by standalone solar or reactor experiments.\n\nNeutrino oscillations have been detected in a variety of experiments. However, direct evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as sterile neutrinos, lepton number violation, extra dimensions, and supersymmetry, remains elusive. Many extensions of the SM predict additional terms in the four-fermion effective Lagrangian, which could lead to observable deviations from standard predicted behaviors. Recent studies have indicated that certain models of quantum gravity suggest a modification of the effective refractive index, leading to phenomena where the standard sine-squared presentation, sin²θ12 = 1 - cos²θ12 ≈ 1 + ε/2 + O(ε³), can exhibit significant effects on neutrino behavior. Beyond these theoretical motivations, there are several significant hints pointing toward physics beyond the SM, including: i) noticeable deficits in solar and atmospheric neutrino measurements; ii) anomalies reported by LSND and MiniBooNE that suggest a non-standard νμ→νe transition over long baselines, inconsistent with three-flavor neutrino oscillation models; iii) discrepancies in the measurement of the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment.",

However, this degeneracy does not imply that all potential configurations can serve as ground states. For instance, the ground states of the one-dimensional model are unique despite having a continuous spectrum, while those of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet are doubly degenerate. Recently, several researchers have examined the ground states of the two-dimensional anisotropic nearest-neighbor Ising model (ANNNI) and demonstrated through numerical methods that the ground states are infinitely degenerate on square lattices when J1 equals J2 or when J1 is less than J2. Conversely, ground states on the honeycomb lattice have been found to be unique. These studies suggest that while the ground states may appear non-degenerate, their precise structure remains unknown.\n\nIn this letter, we investigate the ground states of the ANNNI model using Monte Carlo simulations. Initially, we confirm that the ground states are indeed infinitely degenerate in the square lattice ANNNI configurations. We then explore whether these ground states are unique.

Our observations correlate with theoretical models based on rate equations that account for the high densities of all relevant ion species.\n\nIntroduction: Multipole radio-frequency ion traps have been widely utilized over the past decades as mass spectrometers. They offer high resolution and stability, but a challenge arises from space charge effects when storing large ion populations. Space charge can be mitigated by cooling the ions or through selective removal. Cooling typically requires complex laser systems that may not always be accessible. Selective removal has been demonstrated using various methods, including electric fields, collisions with neutral atoms, photoionization, electron impact ionization, and resonant photodissociation. In our experiment, we employ selective removal through rapid heating of the helium buffer gas. Heating the helium induces the ions to quickly exit the trap via elastic collisions. Consequently, the ions escape the trap volume before they acquire sufficient energy to create significant space charge. A recent study showed a similar approach in which the authors utilized the helium buffer gas directly rather than indirectly through the ions. Here, we provide a detailed account of the evaporative dynamics of buffer-thermalized ions in a quadrupole ion trap, illustrating how the ion density decreases exponentially upon the rapid heating of the helium buffer gas.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS \nThe Kondo necklace describes a chain of magnetic impurities linked by antiferromagnetic exchange interactions (J). Initially introduced to explain the physics of heavy fermions, it is now recognized in other contexts as well. In our primary analysis, we consider the case where the coupling constant J is thresholded at a critical value \\( J_c = \\frac{2t}{U} \\), where \\( t \\) represents the hopping amplitude between neighboring sites and \\( U \\) is the Coulomb repulsion. At absolute zero, the ground state exhibits ferromagnetic ordering, while at finite temperatures, a continuous quantum phase transition is expected to occur into a paramagnetic state. This transition arises from strong spin fluctuations and belongs to the same universality class as the Heisenberg model. However, notable differences exist between the two models: the Kondo necklace features two types of excitations—spinons and holons—while the Heisenberg model only incorporates spin-1/2 excitations. Additionally, the Kondo model includes excitations linked to charge carriers. These characteristic features lead to phenomena not observed within the Heisenberg framework, such as the Kondo necklace's connections to superconducting states.",

These models typically assume that particles move along designated pathways according to specific rules, such as unrestricted hopping.

Introduction\nPlanets form from dust particles through coagulation processes (Safronov 1969; Wetherill & Stewart 1989), followed by runaway accretion onto these growing bodies (Lissauer 1987). This process leads to the formation of planetesimals with masses ranging from \\(10^{-6} M_{\\oplus}\\) to several Earth masses. These planetesimals can evolve into larger embryos or become giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn if they accumulate sufficient material within a relatively short time (Pollack et al. 1996). As these massive planets form, they create gaps in the surrounding circumstellar disks due to the tidal forces exerted by their gravitational pull (Lin & Papaloizou 1986). Consequently, the material within these gaps is rapidly cleared out by viscous effects, resulting in the inward Type II migration of the planets (Ward 1997; Tanaka et al. 2002).

Our approach demonstrates how it can be employed to align points from different datasets or collected at different times. \n\n**Introduction**: The issue at hand pertains to data matching between two sets of observations (e.g., images). The objective is to determine which pairs correspond to the same source. This challenge is frequently encountered when dealing with multiple representations of data, as illustrated in Figure 1, where achieving perfect alignment may not always be feasible due to calibration discrepancies, occlusions, and other factors. In many scenarios, prior knowledge about the relationships between the two datasets exists; for instance, if the data was collected using the same sensor at different times, the corresponding points would likely be similar up to some transformation. In such instances, the goal becomes to find this transformation to enhance the accuracy of the overall solution.\n\nOur focus is on the concept of a truecluster: a grouping of data points in a high-dimensional space, where its members are in close proximity to one another while remaining distant from all other points. For example, when registering two images of the same scene captured at different times, each unique individual in the image forms its own truecluster, as their appearance does not vary significantly throughout the observations. Conversely, the surrounding background may not adhere to any specific clustering structure.\n\nGiven two sets of trueclusters derived from initial and subsequent observations, our task is to identify the optimal correspondences between them. To achieve this, we define a cost function based on the distances among the members of each truecluster pair. We then frame the problem as a quadratic integer program and solve it using a branch-and-bound approach. Finally,...",

We derive a comprehensive expression for the second-rank tensor in the presence of perturbations, including its trace-free components. The evolution equations are formulated by projecting the conservation laws onto the four-dimensional vector space of the metric. Notably, we identify that the existence of anisotropic stress contributes an additional source term to the equations governing the evolution of scalar perturbations. Moreover, we explore how our formalism can be adapted to various cosmological scenarios, such as inflationary models or the formation of dark matter halos.\n\nThe field of cosmology has undergone significant advancements in the past decade, primarily due to precise measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations have provided valuable insights into the early universe, enabling researchers to uncover fundamental physics on a grand scale. The standard model of cosmology posits that the evolution of different cosmic components—such as cold dark matter (CDM), baryons, photons, and neutrinos—can be described by their respective hydrodynamical equations. However, these equations are often too complex to be solved analytically, particularly when cross-interactions are taken into account, necessitating the use of numerical simulations. Additionally, perturbative methods are valid only under specific approximations. Recent studies have indicated that the influence of magnitude gradients can lead to significant corrections in the growth rate of density perturbations during the late stages of structure formation.",

A key aspect of these phenomena is the existence of collective charge and/or spin degrees of freedom, which significantly influence the excitation spectrum characteristics. For instance, in cuprate-based high-temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that the pseudogap regime arises from competing orders originating from different regions of the Brillouin zone.

Introduction: In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing recovery networks. Among these, layered associative networks (LAN), which consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons through synapses, have gained attention due to their remarkable storage capabilities and retrieval efficiency. In LANs, each neuron receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer via synaptic connections. The firing rate of each neuron is determined by a specific activation function, where \\(a_i\\) represents the activity level of the \\(i\\)th neuron at time \\(t\\), \\(w_{ij}\\) represents the weight from the \\(j\\)th neuron in the previous layer to the \\(i\\)th neuron in the current layer, and \\(f(a)\\) denotes the activation function. With the increasing number of combinations of activity states among neurons, the memory requirements for storage in LANs grow exponentially, necessitating substantial memory space. To address this challenge, several strategies have been proposed. One approach involves implementing a sparsity constraint in LANs to ensure that only a fraction of neurons are active at any given time. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, which limits the practical application of LANs.",

These findings suggest that the redder, fainter stars are primarily low-mass pre-main-sequence stars surrounded by circumstellar disks, while the bluer, brighter stars are mostly high-mass main-sequence stars that do not have surrounding disks.",

This result holds true for both relativistic and non-relativistic contexts. Furthermore, we calculate the shear viscosities for specific examples, including quantum electrodynamics (QED), superfluid helium-4, and ultracold atomic gases. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be utilized to describe the collective behavior of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates. \n\n**I. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\n\nIn this work, we focus on systems characterized by internal degrees of freedom represented by field variables. Examples include plasmas composed of charged particles interacting via electromagnetic forces, superfluids containing bosonic atoms, and systems where atoms are treated as distinguishable entities. For clarity, we will assume that the densities of different particle types remain constant over time, enabling a thorough analysis of the dynamics without significant variations.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK \nDark Matter (DM) is one of the most intriguing enigmas in modern physics. Its presence has only been inferred indirectly through its effects on various cosmic phenomena but has yet to be directly detected. Numerous models of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) have been proposed; however, a majority of these have not been experimentally validated. One notable idea is that DM may consist of elementary particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter. If they interact through gravitational or electromagnetic means, they might elude detection, even when present in large quantities. Conversely, strong interactions with normal matter could make them detectable. Numerous experiments have been conducted to search for DM particles. Recently, findings from the DAMA collaboration have raised significant interest, indicating an annual modulation in nuclear recoil rates that cannot be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics. Several researchers have proposed various explanations in light of these observations.",

This analysis employs the rotation curve derived by Clemens (1985), which is based on 21-cm line emissions from nearby spiral galaxies. The total mass enclosed within a radius R can be expressed as: M(R) = V_rot² / (2πG)R + M_DW(R), where V_rot is the circular velocity at galactocentric distance R, G is Newton's gravitational constant, and M_DW(R) pertains to the mass attributed to the dark matter halo. In this study, we assume that the dark matter distribution follows a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Utilizing the rotation curve for the Solar System as reported by Clemens (1985) (V = 220 km/s), we determine that the profile parameters are L₀ = 0.0013 M_sun / pc³ and r₀ = 1 kpc. This leads to a local surface density of ΣL = L / L₀ = 3.6 × 10^−26 W / m² / Hz / sr. Additionally, the surface density reported by Dickey & Lockman (1990) is ΣL = 2 × 10^−25 W / m² / Hz / sr; however, their analysis is based solely on high-latitude regions outside the Galactic plane.",

This issue has been extensively explored within the framework of linearized gravity, where GWs are treated as small perturbations of flat Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we concentrate on the effects of gravitational self-coupling. Each component of a GW has a mass density that exerts gravitational forces on itself through Newtonian interactions. Consequently, the total force acting on any segment of a GW is influenced not only by the local curvature but also by the entire history of its propagation. These self-interaction forces result in noticeable distortions of the wave packets. For instance, a wave packet may experience a shift in its peak as it travels through curved space, moving away from its original trajectory. A similar behavior has been observed in spherical wave packets as well.",

The complete set of excitations relates to configurations that loop around the compactified direction (the time dimension) one or more times, corresponding to baryon resonances. Additionally, we examine higher-spin excitations associated with multiple winding modes, which feature spins greater than two but remain below the scale of the number of colors, Nc. In this presentation, I will showcase some holographic models that utilize gauge theories dual to supergravity backgrounds.

These systems typically involve multiple orbitals per unit cell, leading to several bands crossing the Fermi level. The presence of multiple bands can cause the electron-phonon coupling to differ significantly across them. Furthermore, the Coulomb repulsion becomes stronger for different orbital interactions. All these factors contribute to the rich physics of multiband superconductors. There have been considerable advancements in understanding the manifestation of properties in multi-band superconductors. For instance, the behavior of vortices, magnetic field dependence, thermal conductivity, site fluctuations, NMR relaxation rates, and more have been extensively studied in experiments. Various theoretical approaches, including Eliashberg formalism, functional renormalization group techniques, variational Monte Carlo methods, exact diagonalization, density functional renormalization group approaches, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, have been employed to explore the properties of these systems.",

        "rewrite_text": "The TACTIC (Telescope Array for Cosmic Triggered Events) is a Cherenkov telescope located in Namibia at the HESS experiment site. It is designed to detect gamma rays with energies ranging from 100 GeV to 10 TeV. The array consists of 960 photomultiplier tubes arranged in a hexagonal pattern, providing a field of view of 3 degrees. TACTIC has been collecting data since March 2009. In this study, we employ various analysis techniques to process the data obtained from the TACTIC array. Our findings suggest that these techniques can efficiently reconstruct events over a significant portion of the energy range detectable by the instrument. We also compare our results with those published by other experiments operating in similar energy ranges. This article is part of a themed issue titled “The Universe as Seen by Ground-Based Gamma-Ray Telescopes.” Gamma rays can be indirectly detected through their interaction with the Earth's atmosphere, which produces air showers that emit light when charged particles interact. These air-shower photons can be observed using large optical detectors, such as Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). IACTs have proven to be effective tools for studying phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and supernova remnants. However, their relatively narrow fields of view typically require several hours of observation per source to achieve significant results. To address this limitation, new-generation IACT arrays have been developed, consisting of multiple telescopes distributed over large areas. One notable example is the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), which features four telescopes observing the same region simultaneously. Another example is the TACTIC array, which will include eight telescopes spread over approximately 1 square kilometer.",

        "original_text": "We present an analysis of the stability of planetary systems in which protoplanetary embryos evolve under oligarchy, i.e., they are able to eject each other s neighbors by gravitational scattering but not themselves. We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",

        "rewrite_text": "We provide an analysis of the stability of paused protoplanetary embryos evolving under oligarchic conditions, where they can eject each other’s mass but cannot expel themselves. We demonstrate that this mechanism leads to the rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its critical mass, which is the minimum threshold for runaway accretion. The resulting system can evolve into either a singular large planet or two planets with comparable masses, depending on the initial conditions and their proximity to instability. This scenario is distinct from cases where all bodies interact uniformly and simultaneously; notably, our findings indicate that multiple stable configurations can exist even if the initial conditions are identical. Our analysis suggests that the formation of gas giant planets likely involved several stages of oligarchy before settling into their observed states. Furthermore, our research sheds new light on the origins of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos in circumstellar disks around various stars can experience dynamic interactions during their growth phases, facilitating orbital migration and instabilities, such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these interactions occur frequently, typically only one body will survive by the end of the growth phase, leading to a system with just one planet. However, our findings show that many protoplanetary systems can end up with multiple bodies, suggesting that certain dynamics help prevent the total destruction of the system. We propose that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical structure, where they interact gravitationally and undergo runaway accretion once the largest embryo reaches its critical mass. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate that this hierarchical interaction model accounts for the existence of diverse planetary systems while also replicating the observed properties of known exoplanets.",

The FRF is derived from a specific combination of basis functions, which are determined by solving a series of ordinary differential equations that characterize the underlying dynamics. We illustrate how this framework can be integrated with standard numerical integration techniques such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method to effectively compute trajectories over extensive time periods. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach with two case studies: the Lorenz attractor and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of neuronal activity.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSimulating dynamic systems often requires solving sets of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Various models describe phenomena related to these ODEs, ranging from fluid dynamics to population growth, epidemiology, neuroscience, and climate modeling. Despite extensive research in these areas, there are several challenges associated with the computational aspects of these models. Generally, it is not feasible to analytically solve the ODEs corresponding to many problems. Consequently, approximation methods must be employed. These approximations can be obtained either numerically or symbolically. Numerical methods typically involve discretizing the continuous-time model into manageable segments, resulting in a discrete representation where each segment corresponds to a state variable. In contrast, symbolic methods utilize series expansions, functional approximations, or splines to derive insights into the solution of the system.",

However, despite these advantages, pristine graphene exhibits hydrophobic characteristics, which pose challenges for certain applications. To address this, numerous strategies have been developed to modify and enhance the properties of graphene through functionalization, both covalent and non-covalent. Notably, non-covalent functionalization can occur via π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and ionic interactions. Among these methods, π-π stacking is recognized as a particularly effective non-covalent interaction. Various aromatic compounds, fullerenes, porphyrins, coordination complexes, and biomolecules have been shown to effectively interact with graphene surfaces through π-π stacking.",

A compelling question arises regarding the behavior of these systems when subjected to compact dimensions. The focus of this work is the analysis of a specific type of confining gauge theory known as supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM). These theories are formulated using fields that transform under the adjoint representation of \\( SU(N) \\) and include both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. They hold a crucial place in string theory and serve as valuable models for examining non-perturbative phenomena.\n\nA particularly intuitive example of SYM arises from the Seiberg-Witten limit, which simplifies the gauge group to \\( U(1) \\). One of the remarkable properties of SYM is its capacity to confine quarks in the absence of fundamental scalar fields. This phenomenon is attributed to the vacuum expectation values of certain operators, which yield non-vanishing vacuum expectation values (VEVs) leading to spontaneous breaking of global symmetries. Consequently, electrically charged excitations manifest as dyons within the spectrum. It is noteworthy that the interactions between dyons are responsible for the confinement observed in these systems. Moreover, the investigation continues.",

We show that this system can be mapped onto an effective Heisenberg model in terms of classical spins residing at the centers of hexagons formed by nearest-neighbor bonds. The ground state phase diagram consists of three phases: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and canted AFM states. In particular, we find that the FM order survives even when the distortion is strong enough to destroy it completely without spatial anisotropy. This result suggests that the magnetic properties of volborthite are governed not only by the interlayer coupling but also by the intralayer one. Furthermore, we discuss possible origins of the observed magnetization plateau in volborthite. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe distorted kagome lattice has attracted much attention recently because its structure is realized in several materials such as volborthite  1  , kapellasite  2  , herbertsmithite  3  , vesignieite  4  . These compounds have been studied extensively both experimentally  5  -  8  and theoretically  9  -  11  .\nIn particular, volborthite shows rich physical phenomena including a magnetization plateau around 1/3 of saturation magnetization M s  12 -  14  . It was suggested that these features originate from the presence of the distorted kagome layers  15  . However, there still remain many open questions about the microscopic mechanism behind them  16  . For example, what kind of interaction plays a crucial role? Is the distortion necessary or not?\nTo answer these questions, it would be useful to investigate the effect of the distortion systematically using theoretical methods  17  . Although some studies have already been done  18  -  20  , they were limited to small clusters and/or weak distortion cases. Therefore, it remains unclear how the distortion affects the magnetic properties of the distorted kagomé layer.\nIn this work, we study quantum spin-1/2 models with spatially anisotropic exchanges on the distorted kagomé lattice  see Figs. 1(",

        "rewrite_text": "We extensively explore spin-1/2 systems on a spatially anisotropic distorted kagome lattice, which serves as a model for volborthite. Our analysis reveals that this system can be mapped onto an effective Heisenberg model in terms of classical spins located at the centers of the hexagons, interacting via nearest-neighbor coupling. The resulting phase diagram exhibits three distinct states: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and canted AFM states. Notably, we find that the FM state persists even when the distortions are sufficiently strong to eliminate spatial anisotropy entirely. This suggests that the magnetic properties of volborthite are influenced not only by interlayer coupling but also significantly by intralayer interactions. Additionally, we discuss the observed magnetization behavior in volborthite. \n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe distorted kagome lattice has garnered attention recently due to its relevance in various materials such as volborthite, kapellasite, herbertsmithite, and vesignieite. These systems have been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical studies. Specifically, volborthite exhibits rich magnetic phenomena, including a magnetization of about one-third of the saturation magnetization. It has been proposed that these features arise from the presence of distorted kagome layers. However, many questions remain regarding the microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena. For instance, what types of interactions play a crucial role? Is the distortion necessary? To address these questions, a systematic investigation of distortion effects using advanced techniques is warranted. While some preliminary studies have been conducted, they have primarily focused on unpublished or weakly distorted cases. Therefore, understanding how distortion affects the magnetic properties of the distorted kagome lattice is essential. In this work, we examine quantum spin-1/2 models featuring spatially anisotropic exchanges on a distorted kagome lattice, as illustrated in Figs. 1.",

These results are applied to calculate the optical properties of periodic structures such as Bragg reflectors and photonic crystals. In particular we discuss how the band structure can be obtained from the knowledge of the reflection coefficient only. Finally, we show that our formalism allows one to study also non-periodic systems like superlattices and quantum wells. \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe aim of this work is to develop a general theory which describes the propagation of waves through multilayer structures consisting of alternating layers of different materials. This includes both periodic (photonic) and aperiodic (superlattice-like) arrangements of layers. Our main interest lies in the calculation of the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the phase shifts occurring upon passage through each individual layer. As will become clear below these quantities provide all information necessary to determine the electronic and optical properties of the system under consideration. \n \n A number of authors have studied the wave optics of multilayered media using various approaches  1  . Most of them were concerned with the case where the interfaces separating neighboring layers are flat  2  -  4  , i.e., they do not contain any steps in their profiles. However, it has been shown recently  5  that even small deviations from perfect periodicity may lead to dramatic changes in the physical behavior of the system. For example, if the interface profile contains a single step then the corresponding energy spectrum becomes discrete  6  . Moreover, the presence of steps leads to new types of excitations known as surface plasmons  7  . It should be noted here that the effects caused by the presence of steps cannot always be neglected since they often play an important role in determining the overall performance of devices made out of semiconductor heterostructures  8  . \n \n Another interesting feature associated with stepped interfaces is",

This method is grounded in a transfer matrix approach complemented by the Green's function technique. We derive expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients as well as for the shifts between adjacent layers. These solutions are relevant for examining the optical properties of structures like Bragg reflectors and photonic crystals. Specifically, we discuss how one can determine the band structure using only information from the reflection coefficient. Additionally, we emphasize that our formalism is adaptable for analyzing non-uniform structures such as superlattices and quantum wells.\n\nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\nThe motivation of this work is to present a general framework for describing the behavior of waves through multilayer structures composed of alternating layers with different properties. This framework applies to both photonic and aperiodic (superlattice-like) arrangements of layers. Our primary interest lies in exploring the effects of reflection and transmission, as well as the shifts that occur when waves pass through each individual layer. As we will demonstrate, these quantities provide essential information for determining the optical properties of the system in question. A number of researchers have investigated the optics of multilayered structures using various approaches. Most studies have focused on cases where the interfaces between neighboring layers are flat and do not exhibit variations in their profiles. However, recent findings indicate that even slight deviations from perfect periodicity can significantly influence the optical behavior of these materials. For instance, when the interfaces exhibit roughness, the resulting spectrum can become more complex. Furthermore, the presence of abrupt steps can give rise to novel excitations, such as surface plasmons. It is important to note that the effects induced by these features cannot be overlooked, as they play a crucial role in determining the overall performance of devices fabricated from semiconductor heterostructures.

This method has exciting implications for quantum networks, as it could enable the creation of entangled states over significant distances. Entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, including condensed matter physics, atomic gases, and trapped ions, and it is essential for applications such as quantum teleportation, superdense coding, secure key distribution, and quantum computing.

Our approach aims to minimize distortion by jointly optimizing source encoding parameters (such as quantizer step sizes) and channel transmission parameters (including channel bit rates). The proposed method has low computational complexity and performs nearly as well as results achieved through exhaustive searches over all combinations of quantizers and codes. Our findings show that our approach improves on existing methods that optimize either source or channel parameters independently. \n\nKeywords: successive refinement, layered video coding, distortion minimization, joint optimization, rate-distortion theory, variable bitrate transmission.\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant progress in developing efficient methods for transmitting multimedia data, such as audio-visual content, over unreliable channels. One critical application area is the broadcasting of multimedia data to multiple users via wireless networks, where it is often necessary to transmit different versions of the same signal simultaneously due to limited bandwidth resources. In this scenario, successive refinement refers to a technique in which a base layer comprises a lower-quality version of the original signal transmitted, while enhancement layers provide higher resolution and/or better fidelity. Each user decodes the layers based on their available bandwidth and decoding capabilities. For example, if a viewer wishes to watch a high-definition program but only has a standard-definition device, they will receive only the base layer at standard definition, while their smartphone may be able to access both standard and high-definition layers.",

However, observational studies have produced conflicting results regarding whether a significant correlation exists between the orientations of galaxy spins and their spatial positions (see, for example, Faltenbacher et al. 2002; Bailin et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2008; Codis et al. 2012 for recent works). To better understand the processes responsible for the alignment of galaxy spins, we focus on the properties of spin distributions over large cosmic volumes. Recent surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) enable us to accurately measure the orientations of galaxy spins, facilitating such investigations. For instance, Lee et al. (2008) utilized SDSS DR4 data to examine the alignments between galaxy spins and the positions of their nearest neighbors. They found no significant correlation.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\nThe dynamics of many living systems are increasingly being described in terms of internal forces or active mechanisms. Examples include bacteria exhibiting motility via flagella, cells moving on surfaces, and molecular motors traversing cytoskeletal filaments. There is a growing interest in understanding the behavior of these active systems, especially as it has been shown that their characteristics differ significantly from those of passive Brownian motion. For instance, while passive particles display normal diffusion over long timescales, active particles often demonstrate superdiffusive behavior or anomalous transport, which can depend on the nature of their interactions. This is largely due to the additional degrees of freedom that active agents possess, allowing them to explore the available environment more effectively. Consequently, they tend to move faster than their passive counterparts. Recently, we investigated a model involving the dynamics of an active particle subjected to a biased random walk in a periodic potential. The motion of the particle can be expressed as \\( x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t+1) - v(t) \\), where \\( v(t+1) = f(x(t), v(t)) \\) and represents some deterministic influences acting on the particle. We consider two types of potentials \\( V(x) \\). The first is \\( V(x) = \\cos(2\\pi x / L) \\) (where \\( L \\) is the periodicity length), which leads to a system that exhibits a series of metastable states separated by energy barriers.",

The HHG process can be understood through three key stages: first, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields; second, they travel through the continuum until they rescatter with their parent ions; and third, these electrons emit high harmonics upon recombination with the driving field. We demonstrate that this framework leads to a straightforward expression for the emitted high harmonics, which relies on just two parameters that characterize the molecular orbitals. This framework allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics as arising from constructive or destructive interference between contributions from various molecular fragments. Additionally, we illustrate how our approach can be utilized to predict the emission characteristics of various molecular fragments. High-harmonic generation, involving the emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of a driving femtosecond laser, has generated significant interest over recent years. It enables the exploration of extreme ultraviolet light, facilitating innovative applications such as attosecond pulse generation, photoelectron spectroscopy, and tomography. The underlying mechanism of HHG has been explained through the semiclassical three-step model: an electron tunnels out of its atomic potential into the continuum under the influence of the laser electric field; it then freely propagates until it is driven back towards the nucleus by the same field; finally, it recombines with the parent ion, emitting a photon whose energy corresponds to the energy gained during the propagation and the potential energy lost due to tunneling. Since this model was proposed, various theoretical frameworks have been developed, including advanced quantum models that take into account the effects of the nuclear potential on the electron dynamics. However, despite these advancements, many fundamental questions concerning the microscopic origins of HHG remain unanswered.",

This peak becomes more pronounced as \\( T_S \\) decreases, as the concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms increases due to the reduced thermal temperature compatibility between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the 21 cm emission line. Our findings suggest that this peak could serve as a valuable tool for constraining the value of \\( T_S \\). However, since multiple factors influence the 21 cm PS beyond just \\( T_S \\), further investigations are necessary before drawing any definitive conclusions regarding its detectability.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**\n\nThe recent experimental advancements in creating quantum degenerate gases have opened new avenues for understanding strongly correlated many-body systems. Ultracold atomic gases, in particular, have been employed as effective platforms to explore phenomena such as fermionization, supersolidity, and Mott insulating states. In this article, we discuss a compelling set of experiments wherein the properties of these systems can be probed through changes in external parameters. For instance, if the strength of inter-particle repulsion or the density of the system is altered, it can take some time for the system to reach thermal equilibrium. During this nonequilibrium regime, the system displays novel features such as dynamical scaling and non-thermal fixed points. These effects not only enhance our fundamental understanding of quantum matter but also offer valuable insights into pathways for realizing new states of matter. Recently, there has been significant interest in studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosonic systems. A particularly interesting case arises when the initial state is prepared in a highly excited configuration, far from equilibrium. Even in this scenario, the system eventually relaxes to a steady state characterized by a Gibbs-like distribution. However, if the initial state resides deep within the ordered phase, the system does not behave in the same manner.",

We show that when there is no common knowledge among traders on the true value of the state variable, they may disagree on its expected future evolution even if all are rational and risk-neutral. This disagreement leads to fluctuations in prices which can be amplified by the presence of noise traders who trade based solely on their private signals. In this case, we find that the stock returns exhibit volatility clustering and fat tails similar to those observed empirically.

One significant question relates to the magnetic field of the white dwarf. It is hypothesized that the strength of the WD's magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining whether a system will experience a thermonuclear runaway. If the WD's magnetic field is too weak, a runaway will not occur; however, if it is sufficiently strong, the WD can attain full convective status, leading to stable hydrogen burning and potentially halting further outburst activity. This scenario is complicated by the fact that some WDs experience outbursts despite possessing fields believed to be too weak to prevent full convection.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Dicke model describes the interaction of a collection of identical two-level atoms with a shared mode of electromagnetic radiation. Recently, there has been renewed interest in studying this model due to its potential applications in realizing quantum devices, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. Notably, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atoms depends on the total angular momentum \\( J = N/2 \\) (where \\( N \\) is the number of atoms). The Dicke model was first introduced over fifty years ago, and since then, various theoretical approaches have been developed for its study. Among these, the Holstein-Primakoff transformation stands out as a prominent method, mapping the original problem to a spin-1/2 model. This approach works effectively in the weak coupling regime where the interaction between the atoms is relatively small, but it fails in the strong coupling limit because the mapping breaks down, leading to unphysical states. Recently, several researchers have attempted to address this limitation by introducing new transformations or approximations; however, these methods still present certain drawbacks.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\n\nThere has been a resurgence of interest in alternative formulations of gravity, driven by their significant role in the phenomenology of modified gravity models, as well as offering intriguing alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) within specific frameworks. However, despite this interest, our understanding of the phenomenological consequences of these theories remains incomplete due to the technical challenges involved in analyzing their dynamics. A major obstacle arises from the fact that the equations resulting from these formulations often involve derivatives of arbitrary order, making them difficult or impossible to solve analytically. One approach to address this issue involves expanding around a fixed background solution and truncating the resulting perturbative expansion after a finite number of terms. Although this method enables us to derive useful insights about the dynamics of the fields, it tends to overlook crucial features such as interactions between different modes of the same field or among various fields. For instance, in inflationary cosmologies incorporating modified gravity, truncated expansions fail to accurately reproduce the observed spectrum of primordial non-Gaussianities. A more effective strategy to handle these challenges lies in developing a covariant approach originally formulated within the framework of GR.

It has been suggested since the work of Pati and Salam that if quarks and leptons were unified into larger multiplets, it might elucidate the patterns of quark and lepton masses and mixings within Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). However, despite extensive research over more than 30 years, no realistic GUT has been developed that encompasses all aspects of the Standard Model. In a different approach, it has been proposed that if SM fields exist in a five-dimensional space, they could possess Kaluza-Klein excitations, leading to states with masses inversely proportional to the size of the compact dimensions. These states would correspond to heavier particles not currently accounted for in the SM spectrum, resulting in interesting phenomenological implications. The common approach to study these models is to assume that gravity propagates in the extra dimensions while the SM fields are confined to a four-dimensional brane. Such scenarios could lead to modifications of the Newtonian potential between two point masses, m1 and m2, depending on the separation distance. In this context, MPl = 1/√(8πGN) ≈ 10^19 GeV represents the Planck mass, and ni accounts for the number of compactified spatial dimensions.

The thermodynamics of black holes has been thoroughly examined in recent years, and one fascinating aspect of this topic involves the potential effects of incorporating higher-order gravitational corrections to the classical framework. Recent studies have indicated that these corrections may have significant consequences, even when they are comparatively small against other physical scales in the problem. It has been proposed that certain types of higher-order corrections might contribute to resolving the information paradox associated with black holes. Specifically, it seems reasonable to expect that a black hole's entropy should depend not only on its horizon area but also on degrees of freedom located near the singularity. This concept naturally extends to modifications of Einstein's equations by incorporating higher derivatives.

Finally, we estimate the number densities of the first and second-generation stars using our star formation history model. Our results suggest that second-generation stars could be detectable through surveys such as LSST or Euclid.",

        "rewrite_text": "We investigate how the behavior of the Carter constant is influenced by the spin and mass ratio in binary systems consisting of spinning black holes, utilizing simulations based on general relativity. Our findings reveal that the effect is weak when the spins are either aligned or anti-aligned, but becomes significant when there is a non-zero angle between them. These results suggest that it may be possible to infer the quadrupole moment of black holes by observing their gravitational wave signatures during the late stages of inspiral. This could provide valuable insights into the spacetime geometry near the event horizon, which warrants further exploration. \n\nIntroduction: In this study, we examine how the behavior of the Carter constant varies with the spin and mass ratio of two spinning black holes in a binary system. The Carter constant is one of the several conserved quantities associated with geodesics around Kerr black holes (Carter, 1968). It serves as an indicator of the spacetime geometry in the vicinity of the event horizon, as it remains constant over time only if there are small deviations from axisymmetry at close range (Bardeen, 1973; Thorne et al., 1986). In systems with accretion disks, the presence of mass inflows can alter the Carter constant, despite the overall angular momentum of the system remaining unaffected (Kerr, 1963). Previous studies have demonstrated that the orbital dynamics of binaries containing non-spinning components are influenced by the quadrupole moment of the black holes, represented as \\(Q = M(1 - S^2)/c^2R^2\\), where \\(S\\) is the dimensionless spin parameter of each black hole (Damour & Nagar, 1999). However, these influences become negligible when the black holes engage in close encounters due to rapid orbital motions caused by gravitational wave emission. Meanwhile, observations have shown that many galactic cores host supermassive black holes with masses reaching up to \\(10^9\\) solar masses (e.g., Gebhardt et al., 2000). These systems are believed to undergo several epochs of mass acquisition before reaching their final state of coalescence. During these dynamic phases, the black holes are capable of generating significant distortions in spacetime due to tidal interactions and other factors.",

        "original_text": "We study gravitational waves produced by curvaton scenario, where the inflaton field is coupled to another scalar field called curvaton which decays into radiation after inflation and produces primordial density fluctuations. We find that the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation can be enhanced if the decay rate of curvaton is large enough compared with Hubble parameter at its decay time. In this case we show that the tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes larger than 0.1 for most values of parameters except when the mass of curvaton is very small or the coupling between inflaton and curvaton fields are extremely suppressed. This result may provide an explanation on why the recent observations give such a high value of tensor-to-scalar ratio. \n \n Introduction \n \n The current observational data  1  strongly suggest that there exists a significant amount of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) in our universe. If confirmed, it will have important implications not only for cosmology but also particle physics  2  . However, the origin of these GWs has been one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology  3  .\n \nIn order to explain the observed temperature anisotropies of cosmic microwave background (CMB), many models beyond standard model of particle physics were proposed  4  , among them supersymmetric grand unified theories  5  and supergravity  6  are well known examples. These models predict new particles whose masses lie around 10 16 GeV  7, 8  . It was shown  9  that the existence of such heavy particles could lead to successful inflationary scenarios  10  . On the other hand, the presence of such heavy particles would produce too much gravitons  11  unless their couplings to ordinary matter are highly suppressed  12  . Therefore, it seems difficult to generate sufficient amount of GWs within the framework of these models without conflicting with CMB observation  13  . \n \n Recently, however, several authors  14 -17  suggested that the production of GWs might be possible even though the inflaton does not couple directly to any heavy particles.

        "rewrite_text": "We focus on a scenario involving the inflaton field, coupled with another scalar field known as curvaton, set in a specific region of the cosmic landscape. In this context, the curvaton decays following the inflationary period, leading to the generation of primordial density fluctuations. We propose that the gravitational waves produced by the inflaton during inflation can be significant if the decay rate of the curvaton is sufficiently large compared to the Hubble parameter at that time. In such a case, we predict that the tensor-to-scalar ratio could exceed 0.1 across most parameter regimes, except in conditions where the curvaton's mass is very low or the coupling between the inflaton and curvaton fields is weak. This exploration sheds light on why certain models result in a high tensor-to-scalar ratio. \n\nIntroduction: Current observational data strongly indicate the existence of a cosmic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). Their detection would have profound implications not only for cosmology but also for fundamental physics. However, the origins of these GWs remain one of the enduring mysteries in modern cosmology. To explain the temperature anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), numerous models beyond the standard framework have been proposed, including prominent examples from supersymmetric grand unified theories and supergravity. These models typically suggest the existence of particles with masses around 10^16 GeV. Research has shown that such heavy particles could lead to viable inflationary scenarios. However, the presence of these heavy fields can also produce an excessive number of gravitons unless their interactions with ordinary matter are significantly suppressed. Consequently, it becomes challenging to generate observable gravitational waves within the confines of these models without conflicting with CMB observations. Recently, however, several authors have proposed that gravitational waves could still be produced even when the inflaton is not coupled to any heavy fields. They suggest a framework where the inflaton interacts with another scalar field, referred to as the curvaton, through non-renormalizable interactions.",

A key inquiry revolves around whether these disks evolve into systems akin to our own solar system. To address such questions, it is crucial to analyze individual examples of young circumstellar disks as they evolve over time. However, due to the inherent dynamics within molecular clouds, direct observations of regions within these disks pose challenges. Fortunately, some young stars are enveloped by optically thin circumstellar material that permits investigation of the inner regions through scattered light. These transitional disks provide evidence of substantial amounts of material within a few astronomical units of the central star while maintaining clear signatures at greater distances (Strom et al., 1989; Skrutskie et al., 1990; Calvet et al., 2002; Muzerolle et al., 2003; Sicilia-Aguilar et al., 2006; Espaillat et al., 2007).

We recognize that there are two distinct types of seesaws, depending on whether the lightest Higgs boson has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (VEV). In the absence of a VEV, we find that the seesaw mechanism effectively explains the smallness of active neutrino masses by introducing heavy Majorana neutrinos. Conversely, if the lightest Higgs boson obtains a non-zero VEV, it modifies the relationship between the active neutrino masses, which becomes more complicated than those generated by the seesaw mechanism alone. This suggests that the seesaw mechanism may not function as effectively as it did previously. Nonetheless, even in this scenario, we can still achieve tiny active neutrino masses by considering radiative corrections arising from the presence of large mass scales.",

These spiral structures arise due to instabilities triggered by a rapid increase in the Toomre Q parameter when the disk transitions to an optically thin state.

        "rewrite_text": "We propose that the high-energy (HE) features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra arise from inverse Compton scattering between relativistic electrons accelerated during internal shocks and soft photons emitted during the prompt phase. We believe that this mechanism can explain both the HE spectral shapes and their temporal evolution for several bursts observed with the Fermi/LAT. The predicted light curves align well with those measured by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. This model also clarifies why some bursts exhibit no detectable HE emission despite having bright optical counterparts. Additionally, we discuss how our findings could help constrain key parameters of GRBs, such as their Lorentz factor or magnetic field strength. \n\nHigh Energy Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Proposal for an Inverse Compton Scattering Model by J. Piran & M. Lazzati\n\nAbstract: We propose that the high-energy features in GRB spectra may be produced by inverse Compton scattering between relativistic electrons accelerated within internal shocks and soft photon fields present during the prompt phase. We suggest that this model accurately predicts the spectral shapes and time evolutions of many bursts observed by Fermi/LAT. It also provides a potential explanation for the absence of HE emission in some bursts that still show bright optical signals. Our analysis indicates that future observations could enable us to determine important properties of GRBs, including their Lorentz factors and magnetic field strengths.",

We find no evidence of dust emission associated with this absorber. This suggests that the cooler material we observe is likely not warm dust. If that is the case, then the mass of cool material required to produce such strong absorption lines would need to be significantly larger than currently predicted by models of galaxy formation. Additionally, if the observed absorption comes from outflowing gas, then the covering fraction of the absorber would likely be much larger than what is typically seen in similar contexts.",

In 1964, John Bell demonstrated that hidden variable theories could not account for all predictions made by quantum mechanics, leading to the formulation of Bell's theorem. Since then, numerous experiments have been conducted to test the predictions of quantum mechanics against Bell's theorem. These tests typically involve entangled particles, where each measurement reveals information about the state of the other. If the particles are separated sufficiently and then measured, the correlations observed can be attributed to quantum effects.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe dynamics of hadronic interactions play a crucial role in understanding the strong forces between quarks and gluons inside hadrons. In particular, the parton distribution functions provide important insights into the distribution of quarks and gluons within hadrons. Recently, there has been significant progress in exploring the internal structure of hadrons beyond the leading-twist approximation, particularly regarding transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions. In this work, we focus on another type of nonperturbative quantity: light-cone distribution amplitudes (DAs). These amplitudes describe the probability of finding a quark-antiquark pair with a specific longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse separation at some fixed scale. It has been demonstrated that they play essential roles in exclusive processes. For instance, the decay constants \\( f_{B \\pi} \\) and \\( f_{B_s} \\) can be expressed in terms of the lowest-order DAs. The dynamics of semileptonic decays such as \\( B \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu_\\ell \\) and \\( B \\to K \\ell \\nu_\\ell \\) depend on both the leading and first subleading DAs. Additionally, it has been found that the heavy-to-light form factor \\( F_V \\) in the decay \\( B \\to V \\) is influenced by these distribution amplitudes.",

We find that all three planets have orbital periods of less than 100 days, with two of them having particularly short periods (P_orb < 10 d). All three planets are situated within the habitable zones around their host star. This is one of only four known instances where more than one planet has been found in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting additional planets in the habitable zones of evolved stars through Doppler spectroscopy. Keywords: exoplanet, planetary system.",

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**  \nThe concept of droplet excitations was initially formulated within the framework of mean-field theory. It describes how local perturbations influence the global properties of the system. This idea has proven to be particularly useful when applied to disordered systems such as spin glasses, spin liquids, or vortex lattices, as it helps elucidate many aspects of the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin systems. However, despite its successes, the original droplet model has notable limitations: it fails to account for fluctuations around the fixed-point solution; it predicts a finite density of droplets even at absolute zero temperature; and it does not adequately capture the nature of the phase transition. To address these limitations, various modifications have been proposed. One such modification involves revising the expression for the free energy per site, where the parameters account for the free energy density of the reference state (for example, the pure ferromagnet), the total number of sites in the system, and the volume occupied by each droplet.",

However, the nature of this medium prevents direct probing through standard scattering experiments. Instead, we can infer the initial conditions of the collision from state-dependent observables. For example, the collective expansion of the created medium leads to anisotropic emission patterns, which manifest as azimuthal asymmetries. These anisotropies have been extensively studied and shown to correlate with theoretical predictions. Additionally, another crucial observable of the expanding fireball is the spectrum of emitted particles. Research indicates that the shape of this spectrum is highly sensitive to the state of the medium. Moreover, the suppression of high-transverse momentum hadrons has been observed.",

It measures the distortion of background galaxies due to the influence of intervening large-scale structures along the line of sight. By analyzing this distortion on a wide range of angular scales, researchers can reconstruct the three-dimensional matter distribution in the universe, leading to insights about its geometry and growth rate. To extract valuable cosmological information from weak lensing data, precise measurements of galaxy shapes are essential. However, these shape measurements must be corrected for distortions caused by various factors, including intrinsic alignments, convolution effects, and the point spread function of the observing instrument. Additionally, they must be adjusted for distortions introduced by foreground structures. Intrinsic galaxy alignments, which refer to correlations in the orientations of galaxies, can introduce systematic errors in the measured shear correlation functions. If uncorrected, these alignments may result in biased estimates of cosmological parameters.

        "rewrite_text": "We introduce a project dedicated to investigating unique molecular events over time by analyzing data. This research focuses on the dynamic pairs of states that can be accessed through various pathways in a molecular system. Our method has been optimized to simulate these transitions with precision, akin to how Partner's Jarvis molecule employs FRET technology to monitor DNA replication at high temporal resolution (10 ms). We demonstrate how this approach enables us to identify and characterize rare, yet significant, conformational changes within the replisome machinery. Notably, we pinpoint an unidentified site where the helicase alters its directionality while remaining attached to the fork junction. Such insights into the mechanisms of the replisome will enhance our understanding of its function under physiological conditions. \n\nIntroduction: Single-molecule experiments have gained popularity in recent years because they provide valuable insights into repetitive processes like protein dynamics or enzymatic reactions with unparalleled detail. However, extracting meaningful information from this data often necessitates advanced analytical techniques, especially when dealing with noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel method for analyzing time-series data obtained from single-molecule experiments. Our focus is on detecting pairs of states within a dynamic state trajectory that are interconnected through alternative pathways. These pairs represent unique molecular events that, while infrequent, play vital roles in the behavior of the system.\n\nState Pair Analysis: The fundamental concept behind our approach is illustrated in Figure 1. Consider a hypothetical trajectory with three consecutive states, s1, s2, and s3. If there exists an alternate pathway linking s2 and s3 that differs from the one depicted, then both states contribute to the same state pair. Each state can have multiple pathways leading to various transitions. For example, if the trajectory begins at state s1, it could either remain in s1 or transition to s2 after a delay. Starting at s2 could lead to remaining there or moving to s3 directly afterward. Lastly, being in s3 would always have the trajectory returning to s1. Consequently, any transitions observed reveal essential insights into the underlying molecular dynamics.",

Their large luminosities mean they can be detected efficiently even at relatively low redshifts, while their red colours make them easy to identify spectroscopically.

Their significant luminosity allows them to be detected even at relatively low redshifts, and their distinct red colors make them easy to identify spectroscopically. LRGs are believed to reside in massive dark matter halos that evolve gradually over time, making them valuable tracers of the underlying mass distribution. Consequently, they present unique opportunities to study both the growth of structures and the dynamics driving the universe's accelerated expansion (see, e.g., Percival & White 2009, for a review). In this paper, we report the measurement of the spatial clustering properties of LRGs within the redshift range of 0 < z < 0.8, achieved by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al.).",

One notable analogy involves the influence of fluctuations on the macroscopic properties of these materials, while another focuses on the presence of metastable states. The objective of this study is to examine whether these similarities also extend to dynamic properties. To achieve this, we model a glassy liquid system in which the microscopic degrees of freedom are represented by N point-like particles moving in d dimensions, interacting through a pairwise potential.

These attributes make them attractive candidates for applications ranging from superconducting electronics to magnetic sensors.

This rapid rotation leads to shifts in wavelength due to relativistic Doppler effects and gravitational lensing, with relativistic effects becoming more significant if the emitting region has a high rate of rotational velocity or is nearly face-on. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these effects when interpreting observations of such sources.\n\nIn this work, we examine the scenario in which the illuminating source is positioned above the disk surface but below its photosphere. Potential sources of illumination include magnetic flares within the disk itself or active regions linked to the motion of the particles. We assume the disk is optically thick, allowing for complete reprocessing of radiation within it. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the emergent radiation from the disk, focusing on the geometry of the system. The primary goal of our study was to derive simple analytical expressions to illustrate how the shape of the emission line depends on the characteristics of the system. To achieve this, we performed numerical calculations across a broad range of parameters.",

This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of scattering centers caused by defects generated during the magnetization reversal process. In contrast, no such effects were observed in the sample with δ = 1.

These investigations are crucial for both understanding the underlying physics of these materials and for their practical applications (references 6-8). It is particularly noteworthy that the effects of magnetic fields on HTSCs can contribute to the enhancement of defect formation (reference 9), which plays a significant role in determining their transport properties (reference 10). Currently, several models have been proposed that address defect behavior (references 11-13); however, these models often do not fully account for the defect formation induced by the application of pulsed magnetic fields (reference 14).\n\n### Experimental \nIn our study, we utilized single crystals of two compounds with different oxygen contents: HoBa₂Cu₃O₇−δ (HBS) and YBa₂Cu₃O₆+δ (YBS), which were grown using the floating zone method (reference 15).

        "rewrite_text": "We conducted first-principles calculations to explore the phonon transmission properties in epitaxial layers of silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), which are crucial for thermoelectric applications. Our results indicate that phonon transmission is significantly affected at low frequencies due to the mismatch in impedance between the two materials. Furthermore, the phonon transmission becomes more favorable as the thickness of the Ge layer decreases. We also observed a strong anisotropy in phonon transmission in relation to the crystallographic orientation. These findings suggest that it may be possible to control thermal transport by carefully designing the structure of the epitaxial layers. Epitaxial layers play vital roles in determining various thermoelectric properties, such as electrical conductivity, optical reflectivity, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. Previous studies, such as those by Santos et al. on superlattices, have shown that thermal conductance can be significantly enhanced compared to bulk materials. In this study, we focus on phonons because they primarily govern thermal conduction in solids. Phonon dynamics in epitaxial structures have been well-explored through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and other techniques. However, these methods may not provide comprehensive insights into phonon transmission across interfaces, as they often overlook atomic interactions. In contrast, density functional theory (DFT), which is based on quantum mechanics, allows us to calculate phonon transmission more accurately. Therefore, DFT-based approaches are well-suited for investigating the phonon transmission across epitaxial structures.",

To validate our selection algorithms, we compared them against mock cluster catalogs derived from N-body simulations. Our findings can be summarized as follows: 1. Utilizing the matched filter technique, we determined that the number density of clusters at redshift z < 0.5 is n (z < 0.5) = 3.6 ± 0.2 × 10^-3 h^3 Mpc^-3. This result aligns well with previous measurements using other methods. 2. By applying the same matched filter technique to simulated galaxy clusters, we demonstrated how this approach can be utilized to estimate the mass function of clusters up to z ~ 1.0.",

In this work we propose that magnetic reconnection can be responsible for launching jets and outflows in star formation process. We show that magnetic reconnection can accelerate particles to relativistic energies efficiently via Fermi acceleration at shocks driven by the reconnecting current sheet (RCS).

Introduction \nA significant amount of research has been conducted to understand the effects of spatial dispersion (SD), which is associated with nonlocality or conservation of transverse momentum, on various phenomena such as nonlinear optical processes, spontaneous emission, and transport dynamics. This interest arises mainly from the fact that many semiconductor devices operate in regimes where SD plays a crucial role. In this work, we address the issue of dynamic transmission through a single quantum well. Our objective is to investigate how SD affects the shape of the transmitted pulse. To achieve this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with periodic boundary conditions.

This challenge is magnified when dealing with physically interesting scenarios, such as those involving rotation and/or matter fields.

For example, if the original solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations, the transformed solution will also satisfy them. In this work, we employ nonholonomic frame transforms on specific solutions of the Einstein equations to generate new families of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes—namely, spacetimes that possess at least two independent Killing vector fields with integral curves that are closed.

The text illustrates how this framework can explain certain phenomena observed in astrophysics, such as the Pioneer anomaly, as well as in cosmology. Additionally, it suggests employing the concept of informational potential to understand the evolution of the universe. This article was published in the journal *Classical and Quantum Gravity*, Volume 27, Issue 14, pages 5993–6010, in November 2010. DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/27/14/05993. The following text is derived from the original publication. \n\nAbstract: We address the problem of gravitational interactions among bodies in terms of their information content. The core idea is that gravitational fields can be interpreted as streams of gravitons or quanta that convey information about the source body; thus, gravitational effects are seen as carriers of information regarding the state of the gravitating body. This perspective allows us to account for noteworthy phenomena observed in astrophysics (e.g., the Pioneer anomaly) as well as in cosmology (e.g., various explorations). Moreover, we propose utilizing the concept of informational potential to describe the universe's evolution.",

It has been applied across a wide range of disciplines, from physics to biology, geology, medicine, economics, sociology, and engineering. In previous studies, there have been various efforts to apply the 2PCF to multiscale systems.

To illustrate the foundational idea behind our approach, we consider a simple system depicted schematically in Figure 1. For instance, we aim to examine the mechanical response of a composite material composed of three distinct components: A, B, and C, arranged in a periodic structure. Each component exhibits uniformly distributed properties within a designated region. For clarity, let’s assume that all components have the same volume fraction of 0.33 but differ in their characteristic sizes. Specifically, we consider the average diameters of the components as follows: dA = 10 units; dB = 20 units; and dC = 30 units. Figure 1(a) illustrates the overall microstructure of the system.",

The SSAs are analyzed as functions of transverse momentum and rapidity, the azimuthal angle between the dijets, and event centrality. We find no dependence on any kinematic variable, except that the magnitude of the asymmetry decreases with increasing rapidity. Our results are compared to predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations, including fragmentation corrections and parton distribution function uncertainties. The measured asymmetries align well within the reported uncertainties. This constitutes the most precise measurement of this observable to date.\n\nIntroduction: Single transverse spin asymmetries have been observed in several processes involving polarized protons or neutrons, such as inclusive pion production, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan lepton pair production, and prompt photon production. These measurements provide critical insights into the spin structure of nucleons. In particular, they can be utilized to test the validity of factorization theorems that connect hard scattering cross sections to the partonic distributions within the proton. Additionally, these observables carry implications for physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent suggestions have indicated that large spin asymmetries may arise from the interference of two amplitudes with different helicities of quarks arising from longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy collisions. Such effects challenge parity conservation and may indicate evidence for new physics. However, there is currently only one prior measurement of spin asymmetries in hadronic dijet production at high energies, which was conducted at RHIC, where the nucleon-nucleon collision energy of √(sNN) = 200 GeV is significantly lower.",

Introduction\nDistributed consensus plays a vital role in numerous applications, including flocking, formation control, multi-robot coordination, and wireless sensor networks. A common scenario is the consensus problem: given a set of n nodes connected by a communication network, each node starts with some initial data \\( x_i(0) \\) for \\( i = 1, \\ldots, n \\) and aims to compute the average \\( \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(0) \\).

However, this condition may not always hold since the underlying graph may change randomly over time. Several researchers have studied distributed consensus algorithms in dynamic networks. For example, Olfati-Saber examined the situation where the connections among nodes change according to independent Bernoulli trials.

INTRODUCTION\nThe presence of smaller particles can significantly influence the properties of larger particles through depletion forces. These effects play crucial roles in various phenomena, including protein crystallization, gelation, and sedimentation. Depending on their relative sizes, mixtures may be either miscible or immiscible. Furthermore, there are regions of metastability and even multiple coexistence phases. Several studies have examined the effects of depletion attractions on the phase behavior of simple mixtures. However, most of these investigations have relied on idealized models that overlook hydrodynamic interactions, finite-size effects, polydispersity, and other realistic factors. Only recently have some researchers incorporated more complex elements, such as Brownian motion, electrostatic repulsion, and van der Waals attractions. Despite these advancements, it remains challenging to accurately predict the location of the coexistence point due to strong correlations among the components. Additionally, the influence of depletion forces on the dynamic properties of complex fluids is still not fully understood. In recent years, experimental studies have begun to shed light on these intricate behaviors.",

Additionally, we found evidence of several smaller flares occurring between the main outbursts. Employing an enhanced version of the method developed by Israel et al. (2008), we searched for pulsations in the BAT data during the intervals when the source was active. No significant signals could be detected above a limit of 1 mCrab (3σ), but we did observe a weak signal below 0.5 mCrab, which has been corroborated using independent analyses at different energy bands.",

The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.   They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.    In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.  We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity s greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1–3. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4–6. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7–10, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11–13. A number of theoretical models suggest that biodiversity loss will cause reductions in ecosystem functioning14–16. For example, Tilman et al. (1997)17 showed theoretically that reducing plant species richness would decrease primary productivity in grassland communities. Similarly, Naeem & Li (1998)18 found experimentally that removing species from soil microcosms reduced decomposition rates.

        "rewrite_text": "The issue at hand is not limited to backyard ecosystems; it has been reignited by the recent publication of two papers in *Nature* and *Science*, which highlight the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning. The authors contend that this finding should be emphasized because ecosystems are essential for human well-being. They also point out that many previous studies have shown that biodiversity can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning—such as productivity—without necessarily causing an abrupt change or collapse. In this article, we examine these findings on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as earlier research suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than diminish ecosystem stability. We conclude with thoughts on how our understanding of the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functions could be advanced through further research. Biodiversity loss represents one of humanity's most significant challenges. It threatens the sustainability of vital resources like food supplies and water, and it indirectly affects climate stability and disease transmission. There is increasing concern over the rate at which species extinction is occurring due to human activities, such as habitat destruction, overexploitation, and the introduction of invasive species. This alarming trend has heightened calls for immediate action to conserve biological diversity. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of preserving biodiversity, there remains considerable uncertainty about its role in ecosystem functions. Some models suggest that loss of biodiversity will lead to declines in ecosystem performance. For instance, Tilman et al. (1997) demonstrated that reducing plant species richness can decrease productivity in grassland ecosystems. Similarly, Naeem and Li (1998) found experimentally that the removal of species from soil microcosms impacted decomposition rates. These findings have been substantiated by numerous empirical studies.",

Introduction\nIn many scenarios, it is important to compute over large collections of integers. For example, one may need to determine the number of ways to partition a set into subsets of equal size or to calculate the number of ways to tile a rectangular board with pieces that come in various shapes and sizes.

We demonstrate our method on two prototypical systems - Fe3O4 and LiFePO4 - where it is able to successfully identify metastable phases and accurately predict equilibrium compositions across wide temperature ranges.

These transformations can include changes between polymorphs, the emergence of amorphous states, and the formation of liquid crystalline structures. Such structural rearrangements have been shown to affect various properties of materials, including structural, optical, magnetic, mechanical, and catalytic behavior. Consequently, understanding these transformations has become increasingly important for applications ranging from energy storage to catalysis. However, predicting the outcomes of these transformations often necessitates knowledge of their underlying free energies. Unfortunately, this detailed information is not always accessible due to various challenges. Current theoretical models often require extensive parameterization and in-depth analysis before they can be applied effectively. Additionally, while some machine learning techniques have shown promise with deep learning networks, there remains uncertainty regarding their generalizability across different cases. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on cyclic voltammetry that enables us to investigate the thermodynamics of material transformations without needing prior information about the underlying systems. Our technique leverages CV data across various conditions and employs supervised machine learning to identify relationships between electrochemical data and relevant thermodynamic parameters.

The underlying mechanism involves the deflection of trajectories of moving electrons, resulting in a finite spin polarization at the edges of the material. There have been several theoretical efforts aimed at understanding various aspects of spin Hall transport; however, most of these analyses have been conducted in the absence of strong magnetic fields, where Landau levels do not significantly influence the results. Conversely, it is well established that Landau quantization plays a crucial role in numerous physical properties, such as magnetoresistance and optical absorption, particularly near the Dirac point. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how Landau levels impact the spin Hall conductivity.",

        "original_text": "The hypercube model is used to describe the evolution of life in terms of its complexity, speed, and stability.  The model shows that there are limits imposed by protein stability on how complex an organism can be as well as how fast it evolves molecularly.   It also suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago when most animal phyla appeared simultaneously. This article describes the hypercube model and presents some examples of how it has been applied to understand evolutionary processes at different levels of organization ranging from genes to ecosystems. In this article we present a new approach for understanding the evolution of life based on the concept of the hypercube (1). We argue that the evolution of life can be described in three dimensions: complexity, speed, and stabilization. These three dimensions represent key aspects of biological systems that evolve over time. For example, organisms become more complex through the addition of new components such as organs or tissues; they evolve faster if their genetic variation increases; and they become more stable if mutations do not cause them to die prematurely. Figure 1 illustrates our view of the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex represents one possible state of living matter with respect to each dimension. As shown in Fig. 1A , the number of vertices along any given axis depends on the level of resolution chosen. At higher resolutions, the number of states increases exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension—simple versus complex, slow versus fast, unstable versus stable—the total number of possible combinations would be four (2 x 2 x 2 = 8), which corresponds to eight types of living matter. However, if we increase the resolution so that we now include four states per dimension—very simple versus simple versus complex versus very complex, very slow versus slow versus fast versus very fast,...",

The Eisenhower limit reveals that protein stability imposes constraints on an organism's adaptability and the rate at which it can evolve at the molecular level. This framework suggests that these limits may have been reached during the Cambrian explosion, approximately 540 million years ago, when a significant number of animal phyla emerged simultaneously. This article explores the hypercube concept and provides examples of how it has been applied to understand the various facets of life, from genetic makeup to ecological interactions. We propose a model for comprehending the landscape of life through the lens of the hypercube, identifying three dimensions: complexity, diversity, and stability. These dimensions reflect critical aspects of the evolutionary process over time. For example, organisms become increasingly complex through the development of new structures, adapt as their genetic variation expands, and achieve greater stability when mutations do not result in premature extinction. Figure 1 illustrates our perspective on the evolution of life using the hypercube model. Each vertex symbolizes a specific state of matter regarding each dimension. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, the relationships among the vertices vary depending on the chosen resolution. At higher resolutions, the complexity of states grows exponentially. For instance, if we consider only two states per dimension—such as predator versus prey, fast versus slow, or stable versus unstable—the total number of combinations would be four (2 raised to the power of 2 = 4), leading to eight possible states.

Density functionals have been developed as promising methods to tackle many-body problems in statistical mechanics. They allow for the determination of equilibrium properties of interacting particles by minimizing a free energy functional with respect to the density profile. A prominent category of density functionals are the fundamental measure density functionals (FMD) introduced by Rosenfeld. Initially, these functionals were applicable only to systems of identical spherical particles, but recent extensions have been proposed for more complex shapes, such as ellipsoids, rods, dumbbells, spherocylinders, and even patchy particles. However, most of these developments have concentrated on systems with uniaxial symmetry, with limited studies addressing more general configurations. In this work, we focus on a system of rigidly aligned hexagons.",

        "rewrite_text": "We present an analytical solution to the steady-state distribution for the mechanistic home range model developed by Moorcroft et al. (2006) that utilizes zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) methods for efficient computation of home ranges through double integration. This approach is integrated into the R package adehabitatHR, which includes functions for calculating home ranges based on original theoretical principles (unpublished work without the partner solution). Our method demonstrates the ability to quickly compute home ranges across extensive landscapes of habitat patches. We show that our method offers results comparable to those obtained using the original approach but requires less time when estimating home ranges over large spatial areas. Analytical methods are particularly beneficial for researchers working with extensive datasets or at finer spatial resolutions. Home ranges have been a subject of study in ecology for over 50 years, representing the area within which individuals gather necessary resources, such as food, shelter, mates, and cover. Beyond aiding our understanding of animal behavior, home ranges are crucial in conservation biology, wildlife management, epidemiology, and land use planning. Home-range models suggest that animals navigate through a mosaic of various habitat patches, influenced by a combination of resource availability, vegetation structure, predation risk, and interspecies interactions. This navigation continues until the animal reaches an equilibrium between its movement patterns and the available resources. Various modeling approaches exist to describe animal movement, including both mechanistic and stochastic models, but behavior may not always align with these assumptions. For instance, if two adjacent patches provide similar resource levels, it can be challenging for an animal to alternate between them freely. To address this type of behavioral nuance, Moorcroft’s model incorporates these complexities into its design.",

The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).  We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:  the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.

Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.  However, there are some differences between them at early times.  These differences can be explained as follows:  the Zel dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to other models because it does not take into account the pressure term in the fluid equation; the white noise model gives smaller fluctuations due to its statistical properties; finally, the Gaussian random fields obtained via the fast Fourier transform algorithm predict intermediate values.
