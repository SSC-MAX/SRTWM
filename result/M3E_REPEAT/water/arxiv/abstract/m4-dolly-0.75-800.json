We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

In this paper, we develop a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) based on VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency.

We study both the symmetric and asymmetric versions of this model and show that, even in one dimension, one can encounter rich dynamics, including phase transitions and dynamical phases.

A crucial part of this study will be the investigation of the role of Supersymmetry (SUSY), a hypothetical symmetry that extends the symmetries of the known interactions between particles to include those fermions whose masses enable them to propagate in either a spin-0 or spin-1 representation of the symmetry group. One of the most popular models that has enjoyed great success in reproducing the observed particle spectrum is the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In this model, SUSY must be broken, and the breaking mechanism, which has profound implications for the scale of EWSB and the character of physical Higgs bosons, is among the major targets of experimental study at the LHC. The MSSM Higgs sector comprises two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons, Hplus and Hminus.

        "original_text": "Over several decades, the hypothesis that dark matter is made up of some form of extended object has been widely investigated. These objects are predicted to have formed via the collision and merger of smaller objects, a process which can lead to the formation of stable macroscopic structures. The most concrete evidence for the dark matter hypothesis to date is a cosmological model which incorporates these stable macroscopic structures, known as the Cold Dark Matter model. This model successfully predicts the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today, prompting comparison to similar models in the particulate physics domain, where a similar level of agreement has been achieved through the use of quantum zero-point energy. Despite its success, there are still aspects of the Cold Dark Matter model which lack explanation. Chief amongst these is the formation of stable macroscopic structures at late times, which does not occur in simulations which ignore these zero-point fluctuations. This Letter will introduce a way in which dark matter may self-organise into spherical structures, without the need to appeal to dark energy or other non-particle forces. Spherical collapse experiments demonstrate that spherical structures are indeed a stable outcome of these experiments, and this Letter presents empirical evidence for the hypothesis that dark matter is self-organising into these structures. The methodology of the Letter is as follows. Dark matter is introduced to a simulation which includes zero-point fluctuations, and the resulting large-scale structure is examined.

The parameters, called potentials, are determined by solving a constrained minimization problem. Thus, in contrast to DFT, the orbital-free OF-DFT does not assume a single-electron wavefunction and can therefore directly handle molecules and solids.

        "original_text": "Dirichlet sigma models and mean curvature flow are widely studied in geometry and physics, with important applications in surface and interface motion, phase transitions, and material science. In this paper we show how to derive sigma models from the more fundamental theories of quantum gravity. We use the background independent quantization of 2+1 gravity, Vasiliev theory, to derive sigma models for interfaces in (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. This provides a geometrical interpretation of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity dynamical variables as an (2+1)-dimensional analogue of the relativistic membrane. We show that the mean curvature flow is the $0$-th order perturbative expansion of the gradient flow for the quantum gravity action, and describe the higher order corrections in the flow. This theory provides a geometrical interpretation of higher order corrections to the mean curvature flow. By analogy with the example of the relativistic membrane, this may give us new insights into the behavior of these flows in general, and the behavior of solutions near singularities in particular. The theory also has implications for the potential experimental tests of this theory: In various regimes of physical interest, the gravitational interaction between probes is weak and may be described by a sigma model with a world-sheet metric independent of the target space geometry. This means that many proposed experiments to test two-dimensional quantum gravity cannot distinguish this theory from sigma models based on otherworldly targets. However, there are regimes where the theory deviates from a sigma model, such as at strong coupling or near a critical point, and in these cases gravity may give a detectable signal.

An external periodic force, which can be applied either optically or electrically, can induce complicated and interesting behaviors4-7. In this Letter, we report a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme to find high-dimensional chaotic attractors in the semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber. By introducing a dynamics-dependent truncation procedure, long transient chaotic orbits are truncated by chaotic solutions of low-dimensional truncation systems. With this truncation scheme, we are able to observe novel dynamical behaviors in semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber, such as intermittency and bifurcations from torus to strange attractor. Our method can also be applied to any high-dimensional nonlinear system. We study the semiconductor laser with saturable absorber and external periodic force (SA+EFP). The laser dynamics can be described by the following equations7: +j0=σ(I+Iref)−(1−σ)I−j(γ+β|A|2)|A|^2+η(t);  1  where A is the complex field, and Iref, γ, β, σ, and η(t) are the reference current, gain loss, feedback gain, feedback loss, and time dependent perturbation, respectively. |A| is the magnitude of |A| and is proportional to the intensity of the optical field. By setting the external pump at the desired frequency, the laser dynamics can be reduced to a one dimensional map (1DMA), which is composed of two terms.

In our simulation, we choose the parameters γ = 2 and β = 4, and the saturable loss coefficient σ = 0.8. By setting the modulation of external periodic force to be a limit-cycle oscillation, a chaotic attractor in 1DMA can be obtained. If the dynamics of the full model is truncated at a particular dimension, it is possible to observe long transient chaotic orbits in 1DMA. In addition, we can still observe the existence of limit-cycle oscillation in the truncated system. However, the truncation dimension controls the transient time of the chaotic orbit. If the truncation dimension is high, the transient chaotic orbit is long. If the transient chaotic orbit is long, we are able to observe more interesting dynamical behaviors. For example, if the transient chaotic orbit is long enough, it is possible to observe intermittency and bifurcations from torus to strange attractor.

In April 2010, UKIDSS completed its Early Data Release (EDR), including images of some areas that had not been observed by the UKIRT Wide Field Survey (uwfS; Collins et al. 2004). In this paper we present a new method of searching for distant galaxies by using these new UKIDSS EDR images of the Galactic Plane.

We present spectral types and photometry for all 22 newly discovered T dwarfs, and compare the spectral types and colors of these objects to those of previously known T dwarfs. Our spectral type determination for 2MASS J0746425+2000315 demonstrates the potential for discovering T dwarfs at greater distances. We estimate the distance to this T dwarf binary based on empirical models of spectral type versus absolute J-band magnitude, and find a likely distance range of 19–50 parsecs (66–167 light-years). We compare the observed mass-luminosity ratio of Teegarden s Star to current models of brown dwarf evolution and determine that this object is between the hydrogen-burning limit and the deuterium-burning limit. Future observations of Teegarden s Star will allow for further testing of these models, as well as the models  ability to predict the luminosities of ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages. Finally, we examine the colors and luminosity function of the new T dwarfs, and compare the results to those of previous, similar studies.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion. The observed coincidence in space, age, and energetics provide circumstantial evidence that the LBV supernova explosion proposed by earlier simulations may in fact have occurred.",

        "original_text": "In this paper, I argue that quantum mechanics, like other physical theories, can be viewed as a macrorealistic theory that describes the world at a certain level of abstraction. At this level, the quantum world resembles the world described by classical physics. Like classical physics, quantum mechanics relies on generalizations and assumptions that cannot be verified independently. In contrast to classical physics, however, quantum mechanics also requires measurement results to be described by probabilistic laws that are obtained by generalizing the concept of probability. I argue that this probabilistic foundation is the key to understanding why quantum mechanics does not describe certain aspects of the world with sufficient accuracy. I present several examples of phenomena in classical physics that are not adequately described by quantum mechanics, such as the free particle and the harmonic oscillator, and explain how they can be well-described using classical physics if one accepts that measurements in the quantum world correspond to the acquisition of a certain amount of information. Finally, I argue that this information may be expressed using the word “knowledge” or “awareness”, which allows us to connect quantum mechanics to knowledge representation and management in the same way that information theory does. I discuss how this connection may help to find a better theoretical basis for machine learning and artificial intelligence.",

        "original_text": "Vibrations strongly influence the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. They determine, for example, fundamental properties such as melting and vibration frequencies, and are at the same time sensitive indicators of the molecular structure. The coupling between electrons and vibrations is known as electron-vibration interaction. The coupling leads to a broadening and modification of the spectral distribution of electronic excitations. The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Here, we present the first calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant in covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion. The result of the calculation in CDFT agrees well with that of theGW method. In addition, we demonstrate that for strongly anharmonic molecules the dominant contribution to the electron-vibration coupling constant stems not from diagonal matrix elements of the electron-vibration interaction, but from nondiagonal off-diagonal matrix elements. These off-diagonal matrix elements are induced by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface. The corresponding non-diagonal Wick contractions are frequency-dependent. Our result indicates that anharmonic effects must be included in a fully consistent calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant.",

        "original_text": "On the 150th anniversary of the birth of theoretical physicistClerk Maxwell, a novel form of light-based quantum simulation, known as optical lattices, was recently proposed1,2. By arranging laser beams in a specific pattern and tuning their relative intensities, it is possible to simulate magnetic domains, quasiparticles, and even short-ranged interactions in a system of ultra-cold atoms trapped in this optical potential3,4,5. In this way, quantum simulations, which traditionally require near-perfect isolation from external disturbances, can be performed in lattices which are themselves capable of sensing and responding to perturbations. Here, we demonstrate this principle by simulating the fractional quantum Hall effect in an optical lattice. In this system, atoms are loaded into a two-dimensional square lattice and subjected to an artificial magnetic field. For appropriate choices of the lattice parameters, the system exhibits a variety of quantum Hall states, including the highly-counterintuitive fractionally-charged quasiparticles with charge e/4. We characterize these phases by measuring the real-space structure of the collective excitations and by measuring the quasiparticle s dynamical structure factor. Finally, we show that it is possible to move from the fractionally-quantum-Hall to the trivial-insulating phases by varying a single lattice parameter. This result establishes a clear link between quantum simulations and condensed matter physics, and provides a powerful method for exploring a broad range of novel quantum phenomena.",

These equations, which describe the spatio-temporal evolution of a dynamical variable representing the areal density of particles in a fluid, are used to model a vast spectrum of physical, biological and chemical systems. As in classical Lorenz models, the dynamical variables in the Kolmogorov-Lorenz system consist of three state variables which denote the magnitude of velocity, density and temperature fluctuation, respectively. Contrary to the classical system, however, these state variables are not normalized to a difference of unity, but are related via an energy function which depends on the total energy of the dynamical system. We explore the parameter space of the model and identify regions where the system undergoes transitions between different dynamical states as well as exhibits chaos. We then perform a similar energetic analysis to the one recently proposed by Rudiger et. al.  Rudiger et al., Phys. Rev.

These latter two features suggest that the Homunculus has a bipolar outflow along its axis of symmetry.

We apply our model to interpret the SZ profiles obtained with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and show that the ACT-derived SZ surface brightness profiles can be well fitted by the self-similar form if certain scaling relations are imposed. We also show that there are systematics in the SZ measurements due to the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beam-smoothing effect and propose an empirical method to reduce these systematics. We test our method on numerical simulations and show that the self-similar scaling relations can be violated if the hydrostatic bias is not properly taken into account. We apply our model to the Horizon-AGN simulation and demonstrate that the typical magnitude of the violation of the scaling relations is around 40%.

Of particular interest are the events that drive the rapid mass-loss exhibited by many of the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the Quasi-periodic Modulations (QPMs) of the radio signatures of several supernova explosions.

        "original_text": "The gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303 is composed of a compact object, most likely a black hole, accreting from the gas captured by the companion star. The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

To distinguish the DE models from the standard cosmology, the parameter $w$ in the equation of state is often assumed to have a value close to -1, as predicted by the theory of GR with a cosmological constant. Such a model can be in conflict with the result of modern observations. The data from such experiments as WMAP, BOOMERanG, or PLANCK, together with the results of standard cosmology tests, such as the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) analysis or the analysis of the of the Integrated Ferrometric Macroclimate Report (IFM), can be used to restrict the parameter space of DE models. In particular, one can introduce a new parameter that changes the gravitational constant in the universe, which leads to the fact that the DE models with a constant $w$ can not explain the anomalies observed in the LSS analysis or the results of the IFM experiment. Thus, the models with a variable $w$ are more preferable. In this case the density perturbations in the model can be generated, and the parameter $w$ can evolve from -1 at late time to a value less than -1 during the structure formation, thus can be in agreement with the mentioned observations. In this work we consider one such model. We consider the extension of the $R+f(R)$ gravity, which leads to a divergence free modified gravity (MGG) with a constant $w$.

However, silicon is a fragile, indirect band gap material, which makes it difficult to integrate into high-power, high-temperature, and high-frequency circuits. Graphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, provides an ideal contender for the future electronics. The large carrier mobility of graphene, the ability to modulate its band structure via stretching or bonding, and excellent compatibility with current lithographic techniques make it a promising material for next-generation electronic devices. One potential application for graphene is in transistors, which are the basic devices of integrated circuits and represent the most challenging obstacles to graphene’s real-world implementation. One approach for graphene transistors is based on ballistic transport through one-dimensional nanoribbons, called ballistic graphene nanoribbons. This approach has potential advantages compared to existing two-dimensional devices, but fully exploring this potential will require a fundamental understanding of device characteristics on the nanoscale. Here, we present a full quantum real-space study of ballistic graphene nanoribbon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. From atomistic simulations of electron transport, we observe room-temperature device characteristics and characterize the influence of various device parameters. We show that ballistic graphene nanoribbon devices can compete with existing silicon devices, while offering significant benefits, such as a higher on/off current ratio and significantly reduced parasitic capacitance. Our work is significant because it bridges the gap between the nanoscale understanding of device performance and the microscale semiconductor device physics necessary to make practical devices.

While there is extensive evidence for structural and functional connectivity between regions of cortex in non-human primates, much less is known about the connectivity patterns within single regions or between regions of different functional networks. In this work, we used graph analysis to predict features of cortical connectivity from anatomical and functional properties of individual brain regions. We first created weighted, signed, and correlated structural networks using MRI data and a new measure of cortical surface distance. We then predicted network connections between brain regions by training a machine learning model using brain region-specific values of topological and spatial node properties. The model was able to predict positive and negative weights for networks with correlated structural and functional connection data, predicting stronger positive weights between regions with similar topological and spatial node property values, and weaker positive or negative weights between regions with different values. When trained on a subset of data and tested on held-out data, the model could also predict connective networks that were significantly similar to observed structural and functional networks. These results demonstrate that features of node-specific topological and spatial properties can predict features of their connectivity, suggesting that these properties may play a causal role in determining the observed connectivity patterns.",

Using high-quality data from the South Pole Telescope, we conclusively rule out this possibility at the 3σ level. In the last decade, new X-ray astronomy facilities and innovative analyses have allowed the detection of the SZ effect to clusters of galaxies, proving the existence of faint, ubiquitous cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons scattered by the electrons in the hotter regions of the clusters.

It is measured by the apparent angular diameter, which in turn is a function of the projected physical diameter and the distance to the object. Planets, gas giants, and other large asteroids typically have visible angular diameters less than 1 arc-second, corresponding to physical diameters of a few times that of the Earth. However, when considering smaller objects in the solar system, such as comets, asteroids, and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), their sizes become much more difficult to determine. For example, the typical large KBO system has a diameter of a few hundred kilometers, corresponding to less than 1 arc-second, or a few tens of kilometers, in visible light. To characterize the size and structure of these objects requires a detailed understanding of how light interacts with them. As a first step, this work determines the reflected light curves and sizes of largest object in the Kuiper Belt, dwarf planet (1480) Pluto. Using observations in the visible and infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the apparent diameters of Pluto and Charon as a function of phase angle, and produce the first light curves of Pluto and Charon. These observations place the size of the largest object in the Kuiper Belt at approximately 500 km x 400 km, with 3-4 components, corresponding to a physical diameter of 300-400 km.

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass. We also compare our findings to those of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the peak metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters is broadly consistent with the highest values seen in simulated galaxy cluster cores. However, at present, it is not clear whether observed abundance trends with host spheroid mass can be reconciled with the highest-redshift galaxies in the simulations.

Such a wave is understood as a travelling wave solution to a reduced equation that captures the leading order dynamics. We characterise the excitation conditions in terms of the noise intensity and the distance from the excitability threshold and show that, when such conditions are met, the wave front is determined by a simple phase reaction equation that involves the gradient of a phase function. By applying a multiple scale analysis, we derive an equation for the wave profile that is characterised by universal amplitude and phase-shift formulas, which we rigorously justify. We conduct a linear stability analysis to show that the wave profile determined by the amplitude formula is linearly stable while the phase-shift formula yields a critical wavenumber that determines the size of the unstable domains.

        "original_text": "Researchers around the world are making large, ever more complex simulations of the universe. These simulations, called “models,” are used to make predictions about the universe, and they can be tested against observations of the universe. One such model, which has been very successful at explaining a lot of data about the early universe, is the “Lambda Cold Dark Matter” model, or ΛCDM for short. It assumes that the universe is composed of about 72% dark energy, 23% dark matter, and just 5% ordinary matter, including light particles such as photons, electrons and neutrinos. The neutrinos are particularly important as they are extremely difficult to directly observe, but their presence is essential to keeping the universe flat and stopping it from collapse back onto itself. The model neutrinos are called “neutrino masses,” and the phenomenon of neutrino mass is one of the most mysterious in all of science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detected a significant decrease in the speed of neutrinos moving through space-time, which suggested that neutrinos might have a tiny but non-zero mass. Many observations since then, however, have failed to find this decrease in speed, which would be expected if the neutrino mass was a tiny 0.1eV. On the other hand, various extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos might have a non-zero mass. These include the see-saw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By adding a symmetry which forces right-handed neutrinos to have a non-zero, but tiny, mass, the standard model of particle physics can be extended to the see-saw model. Additional experimental evidence in favor of neutrino mass includes the observation of neutrino oscillations, which show that at least two of the neutrinos have non-zero, but differing, masses. Additionally, cosmology shows that if neutrinos have non-zero masses, then they must have a “normal” mass of approximately 0.05eV or less. If neutrino masses are confirmed, then they will be the first elementary particles shown to have this property. While their interactions are so far unsolved mysteries, neutrinos are the only known particles that can interact via the weak force, which interacts in this way over such large distances. The observation of neutrino masses would be a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe.",

The so-called  knee  in the energy spectrum of these cosmic rays is defined as the energy at which the differential flux becomes approximately constant. There are two conflicting hypotheses for the nature of this  knee . One hypothesis attributes the knee to a suppression of the spectral index of the cosmic ray energies observed by the experiments flying at lower altitudes, while the other argues that the knee is an actual change of the primary cosmic ray energy spectrum. To settle this dispute, it is important to have a method to determine the energy of primary cosmic rays with an adequate precision to either detect a change or determine if a suppression of the flux is present. The GAMMA (Gamma-ray Astronomy in the Initiative Era) experiment, designed for the detection of gamma-rays produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, can contribute to this problem because, in contrast to most other cosmic ray experiments, it is able to measure the energy of primary cosmic rays with an absolute accuracy of approximately 30%.

        "original_text": "Atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations are presented for the dissociation of oxygen molecules on the Al(111) surface. Calculations were performed using the method of rapid adiabaticfollowing, which permits the description of non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a mixed normal-Wigner representation Hamiltonian. The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position. These two structures differ by the orientation of the molecular axis. In the following, we will refer to the 2x2 O2 structure as “bent” and to the 1x2 O2 structure as “linear”. Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments. This excitation could also lead to the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localised on top of the linear structure is initially involved in the dissociation process, in good agreement with available experimental data. This means that the associative pathway is adiabatic. In this work, we go one step further and consider the non-adiabatic dynamics of both pathways. For that purpose",

        "original_text": "In Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), interactions between different particles are modeled by short-range, collision-driven forces that are approximately mean-zero and have a specified auto-correlation function. This approach, which treats short-range interactions as Gaussian white noise, is accurate for particle separations much larger than the dissipative lengthscale. At smaller separations, however, the separation-dependent correlations between the force and its underlying velocity cause the noise to become non-Gaussian. We derive an effective stochastic interaction by measuring the correlation between force and velocity at several different separations and using a minimum-squares fit to determine a two-point covariance function. This covariance function enables the stochastic interactions at short distances to better approximate the non-Gaussian force correlations at intermediate separations, while still enabling effective coupling at large distances where the noise approaches Gaussianity. The resulting DPD equations of motion are integrated with a stochastic velocity-Verlet scheme, and the accuracy of the effective interaction is tested by comparison with simulations of thermal equilibrium behavior.",

We show that, for observables related to nuclear matter saturation, the convergence of the results towards the physical point depends on the range of the interaction, with faster convergence for the short-range kernel.

        "original_text": "We report the detection of six magnetically-driven explosions of rapidly-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) following accretion-induced collapse. The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions. We also determined the probable locations of the progenitor stars by cross-referencing our sample to Gaia Data Release 2 and found that four of the exploding WDs had most likely been observed in the field of view of their respective host galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs are more likely to be detectable from their host galaxies than explosions from low-mass WDs. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic fields have a critical impact on the explosion mechanisms and outcomes from this astrophysical scenario and that such explosions are a promising avenue for the retention of mass in rapidly-rotating WDs.

The process relies on the removal of a thin layer of material from one substrate to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. Dewetting is initiated by selectively reducing the temperature of one or more regions of the substrate material, which can be thermal, chemical or mechanical patterning. One typical dewetting scenario is the removal of a thin layer of material from a bulk semi-conductor to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. This generally results in the formation of one or more holes, which can have sharp edges and possess a high energy surface in the form of a free-air interface. A significant problem in this scenario is the ability of the edge of the hole to relax towards equilibrium, which requires the provision of sufficient edge energy to overcome surface tension forces.

In this paper, we show that for a particular choice of coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields, this higher dimensional spacetime admits a higher symmetry, and the theory appears in one higher dimension as a dual gravitational theory with a doubled number of spacetime dimensions. Specifically, we consider the theory of a scalar field with a non-linear self-interaction on d+1 dimensional Minkowski space.

We show that by introducing a new scalar field conformally coupled to the first one, the system admits a higher symmetry, and reduces to a theory in d dimensions with an emergent ((d-1)+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This theory allows for non-trivial solutions describing black holes with multiple horizons and with a length scale set by the charge of the black holes. In addition, in the classical solution, there is a smooth lower dimensional region behind the black hole horizon, in which the original (d+1) dimensional spacetime is smoothly extended, with the extension encoded in the structure of a solitonic string connecting the black hole horizon with the smooth region. We analyze the solutions with a single black hole and a cosmological horizon, finding that for large enough charge the black hole and cosmological horizons coincide, giving rise to a tri-horizon solution. We compute the entropy of the black holes in the dual gravitational theory, and find that it matches the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black holes in the tri-horizon solution.

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface. The first is called  Spoon-fed  in which the capture material, mostly protons, sticks to the neutron star surface, forming a  spoon  shaped structure. Such transients are found to be brighter when the neutron star has a higher spin rate.

Several neutrino mass schemes were tested with no evidence of flavon fields driving mass to a large value, as might be expected in an underlying theories such as the See-Saw mechanism.

All of these can be classified by their topological type, their algebraical type, or a combination of these. The most interesting 3-dimensional curves are singular ones: they are generically n-dimensional and transversal to n-dimensional space. Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space. A comprehensive theory of singular curves was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, see in particular the works of Harris and points of view of Coppo and Garrone.

This framework implies also that for a generic choice of a curve, there is a plane in the nine-dimensional projective space of quadric hypersurfaces that the curve doesn’t intersect, and such a plane is called an exceptional plane. Curves with exceptional planes are called decomposable. This paper studies the case when the generic curve is not decomposable: it has a unique (up to projective equivalence) exceptional plane.

Most current algorithms only detect large groups, or clusters, ignoring the detailed structure of communities. Here we introduce a resolution limit for network clustering, and develop a hierarchical method that detects both large and small communities in networks. The proposed method works by first identifying super-communities at many resolutions, and then clustering each super-community at the given resolution.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in network clustering, sparked by the development of a wide variety of network data, as well as the ubiquity of network datasets in other fields, such as social media and biology. The study of network communities has traditionally focused on detecting large groups or clusters of nodes with high density within the network, or networks. Community detection algorithms have been shown to be sensitive to a resolution parameter, which determines the granularity of clusters to be detected. Higher resolution generally leads to higher quality clusters, although the tradeoff is that more computationally expensive algorithms are needed to detect lower resolution communities. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical method for community detection that identifies both large and small communities at many resolution levels. The method identifies super-communities, or large groups of nodes that are highly dense and well connected within but low density with respect to other super-communities. The method then clusters the identified super-communities, refining the cluster structure at each resolution. This hierarchical approach allows us to detect both large and small communities at many resolutions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on both synthetic and real-world networks, showing that our method is highly accurate in detecting clusters and outperforms state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.",

The strong force binds the quarks within protons and neutrons in hadrons. The binding energy of a hadron is called its mass. Quarks are believed to be particles that behave like tiny magnets and each come in six different  colors  (representations of the symmetry group SU(3) in quantum chromodynamics, or QCD).

The remaining flavors, strange, up, down and bottom, each have a corresponding named hadron. These six hadron names can be combined to formlarger hadrons. For example, the bottom quark carries a small amount of the bottom hadron s charge, so a bottom hadron is a weakly interacting particle containing a bottom quark.

This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density.

They can be identified through their Lyman-break dropout signature in the spectrum and are observed to exist up to z ~ 6.7. We have obtained spectra of three Lyman break galaxies at z = 5.7–5.9 using the LRIS instrument on the Keck telescope. These data are used to measure rest-frame UV spectroscopy through visible wavelengths for these galaxies, complementing recent studies in the near-infrared (NIR). These observations have considerable implications for galaxy formation and reionization, as the Lyman continuum radiation from massive young stars is responsible for driving the return of UV radiation with redshift. These observations indicate that the epoch of galaxy formation was considerably delayed with respect to the NIR spectroscopy, perhaps to as late as z ~ 5.7–5.9, corresponding to a period of only 250–500 Myr after the Big Bang.

Despite their abundance, properties of SSCs have not been studied in great detail due to their spatial resolution limitations in external galaxies. This has recently changed with the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which has allowed the discovery of much fainter SSCs in the centers of nearby galaxies. We present the results of hydrodynamic calculations on super star clusters with a strong second collapse in both gas and stars.

We present an approximate analytic technique for determining the impact of the second collapse on SSC properties, and apply it to super star clusters with a bimodal (collapse) initial density distribution. We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles.

        "original_text": "Mechanistic home range analysis (MHRA) is a widely used method for estimating home range size. The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours. We demonstrate the utility of the steady-state space use area by comparing it to the area estimated using MHRA and by using it to reduce the number of model runs necessary to estimate home range size.",

This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community. Since 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals. The management evaluation looks at the management, including board and committee structures, and compliance with the Open Periodic Table (OPT) principles. The EBT has published evaluation templates for each of these areas, and each submission is evaluated based on the availability of relevant skills and facilities, the likelihood of cost and technical success, and other administrative considerations. Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost. In addition, inflation can significantly impact project costs, and similar projects completed at different times will often have different costs due to the inclusion of updated prices and shipping delays. Second, the evaluation does not adequately account for risk and cost overruns. As a result, the proposal evaluation does not fully represent the true cost of building a telescope, which can be particularly relevant in the case of international projects, where local political or economic factors can lead to",

Here, we present the results of three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of disk-generated turbulence and magnetic fields, which indicate that the dynamical environment around Sgr A* is likely a long-term stable and persistent phenomenon.

Aromatic side chains in particular provide a good example of this, since they are likely to adopt π-stacking associations in an organized mesoscale structure. Such associations, formed via π-π stacking between ring systems, have been identified as critical for many physical properties of practical interest in polymer systems, including crystalline perfection, reactivity, and mechanical behavior. Because of the strong hydrophobic nature of π-staking, these associations are generally only observed in non-crystalline, fluid-like polymer states, such as glassy or rubbery materials.

In particular, isotopic spin, isotopic isospin and hypercharge symmetries each require different types of interactions between particles with different symmetries, and consequently QFTs with these symmetries are constrained to have different particle content. In particular, the low energy effective field theories (EFTs) of quantum gravity, denoted General Covariance (GC), are expected to be described by the general covariance (diffeomorphism) EFT (diffeomorphism EFT), in which all particles are coupled to the metric and gravity. However, there are several known scenarios in which isotopic or other charge symmetries are spontaneously broken, resulting in a dimensional reduction (DR) whereby local symmetry implies a lower symmetry, resulting in a less constrained local interactions. Several classes of such scenarios are based on extended gravity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity (dS/PSR) scenarios. These all share a common feature that there exists a background field, namely a gauge field (a connection), whose field strength is nonzero and consequently a local symmetry is explicitly broken to a global one. However, the effects of the symmetry breaking are independent of the local symmetry transformation parameters, and so in particular the symmetry transformation parameter becomes a Goldstone boson. This can be used to deduce universal features of DR schemes, independent of the explicit details of the symmetry breaking mechanism. For example, it is expected that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will result in a reduced local symmetry, with the local symmetry transformation parameter corresponding to a Goldstone boson. In particular, for the minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity scenarios, there is an exact symmetry between the local de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, resulting in an exact Goldstone boson equivalence. Furthermore, under certain conditions, it is expected that the spontaneous breaking of isotopic or other charge symmetries results in the universality class of the Conformal, CPT and extended Conformal symmetries.

The inner two breaks at radii of 19 and 47 AU can be explained by an irradiation dominated belt and a transitional Kuiper belt, while the outer two breaks at radii of 180 and 500 AU are likely due to the depletion of solids beyond the frostline location at 100-150 AU. The temperature in the middle break region is best explained by a compositional gradient in the residual dust grain population, with a temperature of 50 K at 47 AU increasing to 200 K at 180 AU. This indicates the presence of a relatively warm region at intermediate disk radii.

        "original_text": "The existence of massive neutrinos is one of the most important discoveries in modern astrophysics and particle physics. Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe. We provide an example of how the existence of this weakly interacting massive particle dark matter could be established or disproved by measuring the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our galaxy.",

However, different real-world networks may exhibit very different distributions of topological characteristics. Therefore, it is of interest to consider how the distributions of these characteristics may vary across different random graph models. Here we focus on two such characteristics, the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph, both of which have well-understood algorithmic techniques that allow for their exact determination for arbitrary random graphs. By employing a variety of random graph models, we find that the size of the largest planar matching exhibits a power-law distribution for every model considered, while the largest planar subgraph exhibits a power-law distribution in some models and exhibits a different, more exponential-like, distribution in others. Notably, we find that the power-law exponents for the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph are closely correlated with the exponent associated with the degree distribution of the graph.

We provide a simple and unified approach to the classical KYP inequality, including results for discrete-time LTI systems, discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) systems, and continuous-time LTV systems. We also extend the KYP inequality to the case of partial measurements. Finally, we show that the classical KYP inequality for LTI systems with input constraints is a consequence of our more general result. The classical KYP inequality, valid for LTI systems, states that the difference between the observability and controllability Gramian matrices is a semi-positive definite quadratic form with respect to the input matrix. This result has been extended to LTI systems with input constraints (i.e., with zero inputs) by various authors.

More specifically, we show that the observability, controllability and total-squared-root-norm matrices of the discrete-time passive system have symmetric positive semidefinite quadratic forms with respect to the input matrix.

        "original_text": "The isolated spiral galaxies of the sample are fairly similar to the Magellanic Clouds in the optical appearance. They are nearly round with slightly flocculent, ocher-colored spiral arms. The flocculent appearance is similar to that of the M33 galaxy, but the isolated spirals are slightly larger. Elliptical isophotes are rare. The distance estimates range from 9 to 17 Mpc, with an average of 13 Mpc. The apparent V band magnitudes range from 15.9 to 16.4 with an average of 16.0. The absolute V band magnitude Mv ranges from -18.4 to -17.0 with an average of -16.5. The colors are fairly blue, with V-R equal to 0.6 and R-I equal to 0.7. The colors and magnitudes of these isolated spiral galaxies are very similar to the corresponding characteristics of the Magellanic Clouds. Thus these galaxies are probably satellites of the Milky Way. The similarity of the two galaxies in characteristics also suggest a close physical relationship. The isolation of the galaxies implies that they have been fairly untouched by neighboring galaxies. Thus their original shapes may have been more nearly circular than those seen today. The effect of tidal forces from the Milky Way is probably to have flattened the original shapes and formed the flocculent appearance. These galaxies have not been completely dissolved by the Milky Way s gravitational field. The estimated masses of these galaxies based on their observed rotational velocities and projected spatial extents are on the order of 10 billion times the mass of the Sun. These large masses indicate that the galaxies are in a fairly late stage of evolution. The colors and absolute magnitudes of the isolated spiral galaxies are typical of dI galaxies, whose evolution is generally thought to be caused by the gradual loss of mass to large scale structures via a process of tidal stripping. The estimated ages of the isolated spiral galaxies based on their integrated colors and based on the presence of blue stars in their cores range from 3 to 7 Gyr, with an average of 5 Gyr. These estimated ages are generally much less than the probable ages based on the number of remnants of intermediate and old age present, which range from 10 to 14 Gyr, with an average of 12 Gyr. The estimated ages based on integrated colors may be underestimated if there is significant internal reddening in the galaxies. These differences between the estimated ages based on integrated colors and the probable ages based on the numbers of old stars may be due to the galaxies having a relatively short evolutionary life span. Some of the galaxies may be new systems in the process of formation. The infraredASAS survey found no evidence of an active nucleus in any of the isolated spiral galaxies.

While most of the properties of the QGP were confirmed in the LHC Run 1, the observation of the novel phenomenon of photon emission from the QGP, reported by the ALICE collaboration, remains a great mystery. In this work, using the kinetic theory of heat and angular momentum transfer, we show that the QGP can emit virtual photons with an intensity that depends only on the temperature and the properties of the plasma, obviating the need for a dynamical calculation within the standard model of particle physics. The virtuality of the emitted photons, defined as the square of the momentum scale at which the induced propagator vanishes, is determined by the temperature, and hence, the emitted photons may possess the energy and virtuality required to explain the ALICE anomaly. The proposed mechanism is not constrained by Lorentz invariance, and therefore it can operate in any QGP-like system that exhibits large momentum scales and non-trivial thermodynamics. In order to explore this mechanism, we make use of the uniqueness and robustness of the QGP thermodynamics to perform predictions for photon emission from strongly coupled plasma, which we confront against available data from lattice QCD.

In particular, for f(R) models this function typically diverges at points in field space where the model exhibits equation of state (EOS) singularities. These EOS singularities correspond to infinite values for the density, pressure, or both. In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of these EOS singularities, focusing on the specific case of finite-time singularities. We explore the model parameter space for which EOS singularities render the universe non-physical, formulating the question as an exclusion plot in the plane of model parameters. We show that such an exclusion plot is significantly restricted by existing data from SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and direct detection experiments, allowing for only a small region of this parameter space. We present a new EOS formulation that is well-behaved across all parameter space and show that this significantly expands the viable model space. In addition to validating the existing results, this demonstrates the ability of existing data to rule out non-physical models. Finally, we show that EOS singularities cause regions of field space to become ghosts—unitary theories that have propagating degrees of freedom with negative energy. Such regions of field space can be ruled out by local gravity constraints from tests of the equivalence principle. We show that these constraints are more than sufficient to rule out all regions of ghostly parameter space, further strengthening the case for f(R) models as the standard gravity theory.",

The VVDS type-1 AGN sample represents the largest and most complete spectroscopic sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to date. This paper presents the VVDS-deep and VVDS-wide LFs at 2.2, 3.6, 4.9, 7 and 7.7 μm, based on 97, 37, 26, 53 and 20 unique redshifts respectively.

The evolution of the faint-end slope is much more pronounced, with the bright-end slope found to be α=−1.8⪘(Mλ/−23.5)½−0.5 for Mλ<−24, while most models prefer a much shallower evolution of the faint-end slope, suggesting the presence of substantial cosmic variance in the AGN population, possibly associated with large-scale structure. The effective wavelengths of the different bands sample the rest-frame UV, optical and near-infrared regime at z≤2, the observed frame far-infrared regime at z=2-3 and the rest-frame far-infrared regime at z>3. At all redshifts the LFs are relatively similar, suggesting that the bolometric corrections are almost constant at these redshifts. We attempt to fit a simple phenomenological form to the faint-end slope, finding that the evolution is well-described by λ*∝(1+z)−3.0 for z<2, while at higher redshifts we find λ*∝(1+z)−4.9. We rule out the possibility that the faint-end slope is constant at α=-0.5, finding α=−1.8⪘(Mλ/−23.5)½−0.7 at Mλ<−24. This extreme evolution of the faint-end slope of the AGN luminosity function is driven by the presence of a relatively small number of luminous quasars, with number densities (per unit volume) up to eight times larger at z=3 than today. Such a steep evolution in the space density of optically faint AGN suggests that most actively accreting supermassive black holes are very hard to detect, with most of the growth must have occurred at very high redshifts.

This well-known black hole X-ray binary is a system composed of a Neutron Star primary orbiting a black hole of 18 Meters in close orbit (13-31 R_s) every 2.87 hours. It is suspected that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as evidenced by its spectral class of Z-source, which is characterized by having strong, sometimes regular, neutron star high-speed winds. These winds are likely due to the transfer of energy from the accretion disk onto the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was detected with the INTEGRAL observatory on Jan. 28, 2005, and reached a maximum on Feb. 24. The work presented here focuses on the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 over this time period. The major result of this work is the discovery of acutoff powerlaw component in the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, with a flux contribution of approximately 50% over nearly 3 decades in energy. This component is not commonly observed in X-ray binaries, and therefore its discovery with INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high energy production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the accretion disk blackbody component which is often seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and is generally thought to be the signature ofNETWORK GAMMA RAYS radiated by the inner part of an accretion disk around a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a neutron star at its core, represents a new paradigm for high energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, and may indicate that disk accretion is not the only form of high energy production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is the result of a new form of high energy production unique to this system, which may be a result of the strong neutron star winds. This may be a promising area for exploration with further, more detailed analysis of these data.",

We employ a numerical model of galaxy formation to predict the optical depth to gamma-ray pair production.

Most of these proposed EOSs are based on a transformation of the many-body QHS Hamiltonian such that the quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent mean-field system, with a corresponding introduction of a  quantum liquid  equation of state (EOS) for the nuclear quantum many-body system. This paper critically evaluates this new class of proposed EOSs. After presenting a general critique of the various assumptions underlying the various proposed EOSs, we present a detailed analysis of the proposed EOS for neutron matter, which yields significantly improved analytic results over those previously proposed. We then apply these analyses to a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter, yielding improved analytic results compared to both the widely used QIG EOS and the previously proposed neutron matter EOS. This improved performance is achieved through a new constraint on the EOS, based on nuclear saturation properties at low densities, and a more sophisticated fit to the high-density behavior of the EOS. Finally, we present analytic and numerical results for a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter that yields an EOS that is simultaneously consistent with both the general critique presented and with the detailed analyses of the neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter EOSs.

Next, the many-body Hamiltonian is transformed such that the nuclear quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent system of non-interacting particles (the  mean-field  system) that can be analyzed using standard classical many-body theory techniques. This leads to a new class of proposed equations of state for nuclear matter. The Hamiltonian for the equivalent mean-field system is parameterized in terms of an effective interaction energy and a chemical potential, with the effective interaction energy given by the second virial coefficient of the original many-body Hamiltonian. This parameterization of the Hamiltonian allows the authors to fit the predicted EOS to both nuclear many-body theory results and nuclear matter ground state properties. The proposed equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter is then analyzed in detail, yielding significantly improved analytic results over both the widely used Quantum Ideal Gas equation of state and the previously proposed equation of state for neutron matter.

        "original_text": "In string theory, Wilson loops provide a powerful tool to analyze the classical string configurations. For more general gauge theories, in particular for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at large nucleon momentum transfers, the color confinement is better described by quark-antiquark bound states, or mesons, rather than freely moving colored fermions. In particular, a fundamental quantity in the QCD calculation of the hadronic spectrum is the Wilson loop, which, in the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop $C$ in space-time. The fundamental representation of the gauge group is usually chosen. The dependence of the Wilson loop on the loop dynamics is more complicated. In particular, the area law for large loops is no longer true. For small loops, the area law is modified to be proportional to the perimeter of the loop $C$. This phenomenon is called perimeter law. The relation between the area and perimeter laws has been observed for more than 40 years. Recently, by using the supergravity in eleven dimensions, a string theory realization of a long Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ group is proposed. The corresponding string configuration is the graviton with one temporal and one spatial infinite size. This allows a detailed comparison between the field theory and gravity results. For finite-size loops, new Quantum Mechanics-like phenomena may arise. For example, it may admit discrete energy levels with a spectrum linearly proportional to the area of the loop. In this article, we present a more general class of string configurations, which are the finite-size gravitons corresponding to loops with arbitrary shapes. We use the second fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ to represent the loops. The corresponding gravity background is a truncation of type IIB supergravity on S^5 x T^{11}. The quantum mechanics-like spectrum on such backgrounds has been studied before. In particular, the different classical shapes of the loop have different behaviors for the quantum mechanics-like states. We also propose a string interpretation for the observed spectra. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of our results to QCD and discuss possible future work.",

These fibrations generalize the notion of fibrations, fiber bundles with possibly non-empty boundary, and allow for fibers that are manifolds with boundary.

We show that exploded fibrations with fiber a surface are smooth orbifolds with boundary, and exhibit a factorization of the map to the classifying stack as the union of a smooth map with a smooth map onto the classifying stack of a certain gerbe. We give two examples of exploded fibrations: the map to the mapping stack of a Riemann surface with two boundary components, and the classifying map of a surface bundle over a surface.

The bright infrared nuclear starburst in NGC4418, shining as a dominant contributor of infrared luminosity in the Antennae system, has been known for many years (Braine et al. 1993, Downes & Solomon 1998).

We detect high velocity outflowing motions in this region, of up to 400 km/s. This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).

Analysis of optical and near-infrared data from multiple telescopes have revealed an overdensity of Yellow-Green (YG) stars with respect to the diffuse background population, a distribution consistent with that of a spherical Gaussian, and a projected size of 1.6 x 1.3 kpc (2.2 x 1.7 Mpc), corresponding to 0.14% of the diameter of the Orion Arm. This overdensity is at least partially corroborated by weak optical emission from dust, as measured by the *Spitzer Space Telescope, and is consistent with infrared spectroscopic surveys showing a high number density of young, hot, and massive stars. The most massive stars, with a likely initial mass of several hundred solar masses, have an implied present formation mass of several thousand solar masses if they have starved-looking disks and are considered to be in the main sequence phase. The derived mass and size are also consistent with stellar-mass-threshold predictions for formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), an expected signature of active supermassive black hole growth at the center of the cluster. The age and masses of the stellar populations are also consistent with IMBH formation via seeds from the remnants of very massive stars, although higher chance of coalescence for lower mass seeds cannot be ruled out. A peculiar velocity of the cluster with respect to the local standard of rest, measured from the motion of bright member stars, and the mass projected along the line-of-sight, both suggest the cluster may not be virialized. If a supermassive black hole is present, as suggested by its likely formation via intermediate-mass black hole seeds or very massive star remnants, the observed properties of the cluster systematically depart from those expected for a classical star cluster. This intriguing object suggests that either massive seeds for IMBHs could have formed outside of clusters, and grown via accretion, or there is more than one mode of IMBH formation. Future optical spectroscopy of cluster members, in combination with infrared studies of the dust emission and a search for an IMBH, will help determine the most likely formation channel for this enigmatic object.",

        "original_text": "Observational cosmological data have been used to statistically describe the probability distribution function (PDF) of the mass of dark matter haloes. In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure. The properties of haloes in clusters are largely set by their major mergers since z &gt; 2, leaving them with short orbital times and low orbital kinetic energy. Conversely, the evolution of void haloes is more complex, with a mixture of processes at work. Subhaloes can only survive in the highest density regions for a limited time, while the expansion of the universe disperses material, resulting in lower concentrations and lower orbital energies.

The IRS data were reduced using a modified version of the S11 script and the MIPS data were reduced using the MIPS Data Reduction Guide version 8.0. In this work we combine all of the archival Spitzer observations of NGC 6052 in order to carry out a detailed analysis of the galaxy s spectral energy distribution (SED). We first construct a broadband SED from the optical to the mid-infrared. This is then used to fit a dust torus model to the infrared data. The model consists of a central BlackBody source modified by a fixed radial density distribution of dust grains in an otherwise empty spheroid. The resulting best-fit model parameters indicate that NGC 6052 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with an estimated power of 1051 W and a distance of 95.2 billion light years. The AGN contributes 74% of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy and the host galaxy contributes 23% (11% of the total infrared luminosity). We also examine the spatial distribution of the warm (50-125 K) and hot (125-540 K) dust, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and use these results to assess the thermal balance of the galaxy. We find that the hot dust is concentrated in a circumnuclear ring with a radius of 3.2 pc. The inner and outer radii of the cool dust are found to be 14 pc and 50 pc, respectively. The total dust mass is estimated to be 2.3 x 10-5 M⊙. The PAH luminosity is 5.5 x 10-8 L⊙ and the star-formation rate is 1.2 M⊙/year.

Since the discovery of the planets around 14 Herculis was announced, several studies have been carried out in order to confirm their physical and orbital characteristics. 14 Her planets can be categorized into three groups according to their sizes. The planets in the inner group have semi-major axes between 0.13 and 0.36 astronomical units, the planets in the middle group have semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units, and the planets in the outer group have semi-major axes greater than 0.7 astronomical units. Planets in the inner and outer groups have minimal masses between 7 and 22 Earth masses, whereas the mass of the planets in the middle group is between 22 and 55 Earth masses. In this study, we performed numerical simulations to characterize the dynamical evolution of the 14 Her planets. We show that, because of their relatively short periods and the proximity of the outermost planet in the system to their star, the 14 Her planets might have formed in multiple blocks and were unable to move further away from the star due to planet-planet scattering. Moreover, we predict the existence of a fourth outer planet in the system with a minimal mass of 9 Earth masses. However, further precise radial velocity measurements are required in order to confirm the existence of this planet and to characterize its orbit.

Such wavefunction-based interference phenomena have been used to characterize the properties of quantum systems, with two-particle interference allowing for enhanced sensitivity to Coulomb interactions.

The model exhibits a quantum phase transition from a normal phase to a cooperative phase as the coupling strength exceeds a critical value. As an exactly solvable model, the Dicke model has been extensively studied and is well understood, but its extension to an N-qubit system with general multipolar interactions is significantly less well-understood. In particular, such general multipolar interactions are found to lead to rich quantum phases beyond the simple cooperative phase of the Dicke model, including a subradiant phase with non- vanishing expectation values of the excitation number operator and a Luttinger liquid phase with continuously varying correlation functions.

To accomplish this, we introduce a novel technique for combining low-dimensional entanglement and quantum fast forwards to scale computation. Our system design is optimized for several key metrics: entanglement generation rate, consumable resources, memory usage, and pair production rate. The entanglement is generated between lightmatter qubits in a quantum frequency quadpter, distillation of the shared entanglement is accomplished in parallel on a cluster of nearby quantum computers, and a quantum signal reconstruction step is completed at a metropolitan node. Through numerical simulation, we show that this system can achieve high-rates of entanglement generation and consume a small number of quantum photons and matter qubits. Introduction Quantum repeaters use quantum entanglement to enable long-distance quantum communication. Entanglement is a quantum property that permits two or more particles to have correlated properties, even when separated by a large distance. Quantum repeaters use entangled quantum signals to distribute entanglement over long distances. Because of the exponential decay rate of entanglement with distance, long-distance quantum communication requires repeaters that extend the entanglement over long distance. Current approaches to quantum repeaters use individual systems, each optimized for a specific range of distances. Systems optimized for short distances, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through detection of either quantum side-channels or modification of qubits in transmission. These systems optimized for long distances, such as quantum memories, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through purification of largelyentangled quantum systems. Both systems require local adaptation of the transmission process, which limits the distances over which entanglement can be distributed. In this paper, we present a quantum repeater architecture that combines features from these optimized systems for short and long distances. The design is intended to support long-distance entanglement distribution over broadband metropolitan networks. It makes use of parallelization to scale the communication overhead from entanglement generation to quantum memory usage, and low-dimensional entanglement between light and matter qubits to achieve high rates of entanglement generation at low quantum resource consumption. Entanglement generation is facilitated by using light-matter entanglement, where matter qubits interact with light in quantum frequency quadpters (QFQs). The QFQs are fully integrated on-chip networks that support multi-user connectivity and may be instantiated using silicon photonics. These networks support entanglement distribution over long distances by enabling parallelization of purification protocols. However, the purification rates in previous approaches were limited by the need to localize the entanglement generation to specific purification registers. In this design, we propose a metropolitan node that combines long-distance entanglement distribution with fast forwards, a form of quantum communication that allow a quantum signal to be reconstructed despite loss. Using the long-distance entanglement, local computation is able to reconstruct the quantum signals at the metropolitan node, allowing full entanglement distribution over long distance with the",

We derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that includes the Jaynes-Cummings, Tavis-Cummings, and dipole couplings. Numerical simulations of quantum Rabi, Dicke, and Landau-Zener models are performed to illustrate the QED regime. This low-energy QED description facilitates a controlled analysis of qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels. The predicted dispersive decay and dephasing rates are consistent with recent experiments. Introduction Realistic superconducting qubits like the transmon are an excellent platform for studying quantum many-body phenomena in nature. In particular, their highly tunable nature allows for an exquisite control of both system- and bath- dephasing processes. This exquisite control, however, has become an asset that now poses a challenge for sufficiently understanding and describing the underlying physical mechanisms. In this paper, we develop a detailed quantum electrodynamical (QED) description of interactions between realistic superconducting qubits and microwave radiation. The derivation is based on a high-fidelity derivation of the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian in  1 . Unlike other derivations in the literature, our starting point is a fully calibrated transmon model, that is, a model with the complete experimental control settings encoded. By calibrating this model, we account for parasitic modes, an important consideration given the extreme small size of superconducting qubits. A crucial result of this derivation is an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that includes the Jaynes-Cummings, Tavis-Cummings, and dipole couplings. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we obtain analytical expressions for qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels. These analytical expressions facilitate a systematic understanding and controlled analysis of qubit-microwave interactions for any given experimental system setup. The low-energy QED description enables a quantitative comparison with experiment and an assessment of control errors and residual non-QED interactions. Computing the exact dynamics of the full system would be intractable given the current level of complexity, but we can perform a numerical simulation of the low-energy QED Hamiltonian. Our results are in excellent agreement with both the measured resonant decay rates and the anlytical expression derived in the paper.

The paper presents a general framework for building a superconducting theory in a magnetic field. Such theory should be able to describe the superconductor below the critical temperature, as well as the magnetic materials with an Abrikosov vortices lattice at zero temperature. The starting point of the theory is to assume that the order parameter is a complex field that depends on both space and time. In this way, all the degrees of freedom associated with the magnetic field are included into the theory and the coexistence of superconductor and magnetic flux states can be described. Due to the complex nature of the order parameter, one needs to include many degrees of freedom to fully describe the superconducting state. To do so, one needs to resort to a many-body expansion of the free energy. For small coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic field, a local approximation is sufficient to capture the main physical mechanism. This is done by treating the superconducting and magnetic materials on equal footings by introducing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional. The theory is applied to describe superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale. In this regime, the London theory cannot be applied and a fully quantum mechanical treatment is required. In particular, it is shown that one can get a region in which a type II superconductor can sustain a magnetic field without any vortex lattice.",

Due to their high inward flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, the H<--->H2 reaction became rapidly inhibited, and subsequent H2 formation was suppressed. As a result, the lack of hydrogen caused these stars to become predominantly core-dominant, leading to the stellar dynamical collapse of the cores of these very first stars. Magnetorotational collapse, as the name suggests, involves a combination of magnetic and rotational forces that aid the gravitational force in collapsing a population III star. This process has never before been observed in such old, very first stars, and its implications for the early life of the universe are discussed. The very first stars to form in the universe, Population III, had no hydrogen due to the H<--->H2 reaction becoming inhibited by the suppression of subsequent H2 formation. These first stars were extremely massive, with typical masses of a few hundred solar masses. Population III stars, like our Sun, were initially dominated by their cores. With further contraction, radialGreg Anglin instability caused the formation of an iron core. This led to a dynamical collapse of the core, which is ultimately triggered when iron nuclei reach absolute zero pressure.

There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy. The results of long-term observations of the dust content in a number of galaxies, made using the 100-m and the 45-m radio telescopes of the MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and the 0.7-meter telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the APEX Telescope, the IRAM 30-m and the SEST 20-m radio telescopes in Chile, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, and other facilities have shown that the production and evolution of dust in a galaxy is associated with certain properties of this galaxy. It was established that in late-type spiral galaxies the intensity of radiation in radio wavelengths increases with time, which indicates the gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium, due to the merger of large bodies. In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies.

In particular, it was shown that the inclusion of the rho meson in the analysis leads to a considerable improvement of the description of these experiments.

The Regge theory states that the total cross section of hadrons increases with the energy level in an approximate power-law dependence:.

The Regge theory is based on the assumption that the exchanges between particles in the different reactions have a common pattern, which can be described by the exchange of fundamental particles called reggeons. The reggeons correspond to intermediate states in the quantum field theory between two hadrons.

The conductance through the dot is computed as a function of the system’s parameters, namely the gate and bias voltages, as well as the plunger (i.e., orbital) number of the dot. A separation between low- and high-energy scales is established by a smallness parameter which is assumed to be the bias voltage scaled by a large energy, e.g., the plunger energy. Exact solution is obtained by truncating the hierarchy of integro-differential equations at the second member. In this approximation the conductance is parameterized by the solution of a closed set of differential equations. Our solution method allows us to study a wide range of the system’s parameters. In particular, we compute a crossover from tunneling to charge-transfer regimes as the system is tuned from an initial almost empty dot to a filled dot. Furthermore, we compute a cutoff energy and a cutoff scale that separate slow (i.e., flowing with the system’s parameters) from fast (i.e., independent) scales in the system.

However, if the potential of the scalar field has a lower bound, the contribution of the fluctuations of this field to the gravitational waves is not effective. In this work, we study the maximal amount of gravitational waves generated in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effects of the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution. Thus, the fluctuation of the scalar field determining the number density of dark matter contributes to the gravitational waves with the parameter Omega_GW, which is related to the speed of the gravity.

        "original_text": "Understanding the origin of ferromagnetism is one of the key issues in materials science. In this paper, we report an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice (specifically the Ti4+ sites), the crystal structure evolves to anatase type and acquires a net magnetic moment, which is found to be persistent above room temperature. This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem. In the supplementary material, authors have provided more experimental data and also some hints for the theoretical explanation of TDIM. First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic. Various mechanisms for the persistence of this net moment are explored. While substantial ionic coupling in Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is required to explain the observed moment value. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature of this moment is consistent with experimental results. Our work demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism to induce ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials. We have provided possible evidences to support the hypothesis that Ti4+ disorder accounts for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in a number of materials. Since Ti4+ disorder has been observed in a number of anatase type TiO2 samples, our work raises the possibility of persistent ferromagnetism in TiO2 based materials and related systems. This study was motivated by the recent report of persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. 1  While much research has been devoted to understand the origin of ferromagnetism in metals, understanding ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials is still an active area of research. TiO2, which is used as a semiconductor in many devices, is nonmagnetic. However, recent work has demonstrated that certain forms of TiO2 can be ferromagnetic. 2,3  Since ferromagnetism has been observed in a number of Ti4+-disordered materials, understanding the origin of ferromagnetism in TiO2 is of both fundamental and applied interest. This work explores the Ti4+-disorder induced ferromagnetism (TDIM) mechanism in TiO2 anatase. To explore the TDIM mechanism in TiO2, we synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with a wide size distribution using a sol gel technique. We explored three distinct synthesis methods to control the amount of Ti4+ disorder",

        "original_text": "Astrophysical jets are very powerful, collimated outflows driven from compact objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces. We conclude that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may have an important impact on astrophysical jets, which makes it an important area for future study. The resonant coupling discussed here could also be important in microquasars, the envirnment of black hole systems like SS 433, where a pair of stars orbiting each other eject high-energy jets. The stars are in nearly circular orbits, but the jets are highly relativistic and tend to ejection in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. This parallelism between the orbital plane and the jets strongly suggests the extraction of energy and momentum from the orbital motion. The extraction of energy and momentum from a shearing relativistic flow may provide a new mechanism for this parallelism. Resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetos",

The geomagnetic field can be observed directly via magnetometers, or inferred from satellite measurements of the geopotential and bulk plasma flow. While the state of the art in direct measurement technology has improved considerably over the past five decades, direct measurements are costly, subject to availability, and are unable to measure three dimensional field information at the Earth’s surface.

A popular solvent model for such systems is dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), which combines simple mechanics with pairwise screened interaction between particles. Although DPD exhibits different dynamic behavior than real polymers, it provides a computationally efficient method to study polymer systems. Recently, the standard DPD thermostat has been extended to weakly couple the motion of particles to a external heat bath, producing the Langevin DPD (LDP) thermostat. The LDP thermostat has been shown to provide improved thermostability and tunability for DPD, but its effectiveness for polymer simulations is unclear. In this work, we compare DPD and LDP for out-of-equilibrium simulations of a freely jointed chain in solution. Simulations were performed for both equilibrium conformations and under stress, and compared to results from all-atom molecular dynamics with an implicit solvent. We find that LDP exhibits increased stability relative to DPD, particularly for the conformational distributions. However, LDP significantly reduces the sampling efficiency for the freely jointed chain, particularly for high persistence length and low temperature. These differences are correlated to the momentum distributions, which are strongly correlated with the angular momentum alignment of the polymer. Overall, these results demonstrate that LDP is a promising thermostat for DPD, but its effectiveness depends on the system and the variables of interest.",

The system is composed of coupled maps, where the density of preys evolves according to a discrete stochastic iteration and the density of predators is governed by a continuous deterministic approximation. Each prey can randomly become predator at each time step with a given probability. The population goes through two phases: a disordered one where the populations evolve toward a uniform distribution, and an ordered one where the system converges to a non-trivial spatio-temporal pattern. In the ordered phase, a travelling wave seems to appear propagating at a constant velocity. Its shape and the velocity of the wave can be accurately predicted by a self-consistent equation arising from a mean-field approximation of the probabilistic CA. The self-consistent equation displays two branches of solution: a stable one corresponding to the travelling wave, and an unstable one leading to an uniform distribution of the populations. These results highlight the ability of the proposed CA to capture both local and non-local interactions, and to reveal the impact of randomness on the pattern formation.

Typically, each hydrogen atom is shared between two different molecules, with a distance of about 0.98Å between the oxygen atoms in each molecule and the two shared hydrogen atoms. A classical description of a hydrogen bond requires the presence of an attractive force between the sharing atoms, and this is precisely the case for the water molecules in this cluster, as the forces between the oxygen atoms and the shared hydrogen atoms are all attractive. However, the shared hydrogen atoms are not isolated; they are part of a network of such pairs of atoms that forms a three dimensional lattice throughout the water molecule s volume.

One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contribution of the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino to this magnetic moment. We find an upper bound on their masses for a given value of the lightest neutrino mass. This model can be considered as an example of an unbalanced See-Saw mechanism, where the violation of the conservation of one or several of the additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very massive particles. This model has some other interesting phenomenological implications, in particular the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this model leads to the observed enhancement of the Higgs decay to a pair of muons, presented at the Moriond EW session as an excess. Massive and massless neutrinos were hypothesized in the 60s in order to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

Since the identity is local, it follows that the dimensions of the homogeneous components of given length of the Levi identity must be identical. In 1983, A. M.

We believe that the cell itself, by providing an environment with suitable pH, temperature and salt concentrations, and protected from direct physical injury, could serve as an ideal host for the biosynthesis of DNA. Theory suggests that significant barriers to intracellular DNA synthesis include the thermal stability of DNA in bacterial cells (which favors nascent DNA strands in their natural double-stranded form), cell membrane instability (which prevents larger DNA pieces from escaping the cell once transcription begins), and nuclease attack (which degrades DNA strands). In order to solve these problems, we have designed synthetic DNA structures with optimized thermal and membrane properties. In addition, we have identified potent nuclease-resistant DNA structures that have yet to be utilized in bio-nano fabrication. All of these DNA properties should facilitate the production and assembly of complex nanoscale structures from within bacterial cells. The versatile genetic information encoding capacity of DNA allows the digitalization of any signal for processing by the cell. An analogy may be made to the molecular computer that performs calculations by processing digital signals in a sequence of logic operations. These logic operations may be encoded in the form of DNA. As a result, any biochemical signal could be converted into a digital form suitable for processing by the cell.

The system may be formally separated into one containing only the long-range interactions, a system of particles with periodic boundary conditions, and a system of particles with vanishing velocity. The former may be solved exactly, while the latter two may be solved numerically. In this work, the three-dimensional Ising model is used as a test case for this approach. Using a novel technique to systematically eliminate short-range interactions, it is shown that short-range attractions can reduce the thermal conductivity of the fluid by up to four orders of magnitude without changing the critical temperature. It is further shown that this reduction in thermal conductivity results in a divergent self-diffusivity and vanishing viscosity, while the structural order remains finite.

Such studies are of particular relevance to characterize the Degree of Chaos /thermalization achieved in these collisions. Our results are based on analyzing 1.7 million minimum-bias events from the PHOBOS experiment. We compare charged and neutral particle spectra, elliptic flow, and high transverse momentum particle production, covering a range of 15% centrality covering the most central to the most peripheral Au+Au collisions. We observe that particle production at forward rapidity is very well described by a quadratic function of the number of N-particles per unit of rapidity, where N=charged or neutral. These results are compared to hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), calculations from lattice QCD, and models from weakly coupled physics. Our data show the most detailed and strongest constraints on these models, and indicate the importance of specific aspects of the dynamics of these collisions to different aspects of the observed particle spectra. We quantify these aspects using a thermal-based model. This allows us to derive the thermal parameters for the system at the chemical and kinetic freezeouts. These are compared to predictions from ideal hadron gas and transport models at both constituent-quark level and hadronic level. We find that the kinetic freezeout parameter is more strongly constrained by the data, and we extract a conservative range of temperatures of 155 MeV<T<175 MeV. The preliminary results indicate that the hadron gas phase is short-lived, with a strong transition to a dense and hadronically collapsed medium at chemical freezeout. While both hard scattering and early phases of the nuclear collision appear to be consistent with being perturbative in nature, the strongly interacting final state is well described by a gluon plasma with moderate centrality-dependent temperatures of 155 MeV<T<175 MeV.",

From the X-shooter spectrum we derive a upper limit on the redshift of z < 0.1667.

The prominent double-humped structure in the lightcurve, which has been interpreted as the signature of the passage of a jet through the surrounding medium, is also seen in our data, but only as a shallow deficit in the early afterglow lightcurve. We suggest that the shallow deficit is caused by an underestimated k-corrected host-galaxy magnitude in earlier studies, and suggest that the real structure in the lightcurve has a much smoother gradient. Finally, we consider the possibility that the optical/OIR afterglow may have been extinguished by dust in the galaxy itself.

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun in the Solar System.

Disordering transitions occur when a solid mixture transitions from a solid-like state to a liquid-like state, and peak effect is a phenomenon which occurs when the volume fraction of a solid mixture at the peaks of the density profile is greater than the average volume fraction of the mixture. These phenomena have both been observed in a wide range of material systems, including glass forming liquids, granular materials, and heterogeneous mixtures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect can be manipulated by altering the variance of the particle size distribution. We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations to model a binary mixture composed of particles with the same size but with different levels of variance. Through the use of radial distribution functions, we are able to demonstrate that disordering transitions and peak effect occur at lower volume fractions for systems with larger variances. Additionally, we observe an increased frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect as the variance of the particle size distribution increases, and we identify an approximate scaling relationship between these two quantities. We provide a physical argument for this scaling relationship based on the average interparticle force, and compare our results with prior works which have explored similar relationships. We also discuss the broader implications of these results in the context of recent theories on the origins of disorder in condensed matter systems.",

We apply our model to the gas observed in the prsent day universe and show that, although the Xelement enhancement is typically much lower than in high-z systems, it is able to reproduce the general trend. Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement depends strongly on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. We apply our model to a broad range of spectra and show that different spectra lead to Xelement enhancements at the level of $10^{-3} - 1$ solar values at $z = 0$ for different metallicities at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This wide range of possible enhancements highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe. We describe an effect whereby the interactions between cosmic rays and the primordial gas influence both the gas phase and the element abundances. This has important implications for the potentiality of the gas to form structures and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time.

        "original_text": "The most ancient known stars in the universe are the blue straggler (BS) stars. These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

Over the last decade, an impressive amount of data has been obtained from B-factories and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and next-generation experiments at super-b-factories and the LHC upgrade are expected to collect samples in the range of 100 billion events. Over the years, several high-performance theoretical calculations for these decay rates have been performed, using a variety of approaches. Of particular interest are QCD radiative corrections, which are known to modify the decay rates by approximately 20%–25%  1–3 . The current state of the art calculation is based on the conformal expansion of the QCD amplitude  4 , combined with several modern techniques for the numerical evaluation of Feynman diagrams. In this paper we present a new theoretical calculation of the QCD corrections to the aforementioned decay rates, using the semi-analytic approach of brilliant unitarity  5 , based on a model for the strong interaction amplitude with a limited number of adjustable parameters. In our implementation, the model enters as an Ansatz for the decay amplitude as a function of the mass scale μ, and parameter-free strong interaction unitary constraints at high energy scales are used to determine the model parameters. We apply this approach to the calculation of the exclusive charmless B decay amplitudes into two-body hadronic final states, with a $D$ or $D_s$ meson, at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong interaction coupling constant α_s, and to all orders in the heavy quark expansion. We perform a matched calculation of the hard scattering functions, as well as of the corresponding soft functions, i.e., the propagator and vertex corrections. The remaining infrared singularities are isolated in the renormalization scale and are absorbed in the parameters of the model. The strong interaction kernel is obtained from the dispersive representation of the two-particle intermediate states, and the light degrees of freedom are integrated out in the spirit of hard scattering and heavy quark effective theory.",

Interacting proteins, which perform the signaling functions, are densely connected forming a complex signaling network. The signaling networks transmit and process information through a combination of multiple signaling pathways.

This paper presents a method for reconstructing signaling networks from proteomics data. This is a challenging problem due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the underlying signaling networks, the high sensitivity of signaling processes to variations in network topologies and parameters, and the large number of cells and proteomes typically required for statistically relevant data. The proposed method combines protein interaction networks with novel methodology for sparse representation of signaling networks in order to reconstruct signaling networks. The signaling networks are sparsely represented in a network of interacting proteins. Using the network of interacting proteins, we are able to reconstruct signaling networks while significantly reducing the number of interactions from potentially many thousands to a more manageable few. This allows us to study the signaling networks statistically and apply rigorous methods of network inference to reconstruct the networks. The signaling networks are tested against several simulation datasets and shown to accurately infer signaling networks.

After careful application of various data quality filters, we identify three candidate systems with coherent, faint, linear streams of stars consistent with a stream-like configuration of the disrupted satellite galaxies. The brightest of these three candidates, with a heliocentric recessional velocity of 14,200 km/s, is consistent with other confirmed satellites of the Milky Way at lower heliocentric velocities, supporting its identification as a dark-matter-dominated stream. The other two candidates, with heliocentric recessional velocities of 24,300 km/s and 32,300 km/s, have very low satellite galaxy contamination and can each be plausibly associated with an identified accretion event in the fossil record, suggesting that the streams have physical properties similar to those of previously-observed cosmological streams.

Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",

A recently introduced variable, the partial filling factor (PFF), is used to quantify the statistical spread of these generated sequences. PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations. This corresponds to a strong spatial heterogeneity of the low-zero sequences and supports a growth mechanism of these sequences from a few deterministically produced seeds. For certain mixtures, it is found that rare event sequences happen with a non-vanishing frequency, which makes them of interest for cryptography.

OFCs are highly coherent light sources that can be generated in various nonlinear optical cavities. By measuring the frequency of the reflected light from the target object, the OFC enables nanometer scale resolution and accurate measurement of optical spectra. This article describes an OFC-based calibration technique for optical spectrum analyzers. It consists of three key modules: a wavemeter based on Michelson interferometer, a tunable OFC, and an optical spectrum analyzer. The OFC is used to measure the target spectrum with high accuracy. In contrast to the typical spectrometer calibration using a commercial wavelength meter, the wavelength of OFC is directly measured rather than derived. Therefore, this technique has the same resolution but is more accurate and useful for many important applications in optical communications, ranging, and sensing. A block diagram of this OFC-based calibration technique is presented. This technique can measure the center wavelength, the bandwidth, and the intensity of the target spectrum with high precision. This makes it suitable for many important applications such as wavelength meter for optical communication networks, spectrum sensing with high resolution, and laser frequency and stability monitoring. The experimental results demonstrate that this OFC-based technique can measure center wavelength and bandwidth with a relative error less than 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The resolution of the intensity measurement is 0.2% FSWM (Full Width at Half Maximum).

We found that Ni(II) stress suppressed hypocotyl elongation, and the level of hypocotyl elongation was correlated with the amount of light quanta received by the seedlings. The physiological parameters affected by Ni(II) stress were found to be light-dependent, while the morphological parameters were not. Our results suggest that Ni(II) stress impairs the perception of light by seedlings, and the degree of impairment is proportional to the severity of Ni(II) stress.

        "original_text": "Perturbation theory is one of the most important techniques in physics. It provides a framework to describe the low energy dynamics of a system using the interactions between its various components or scales. Examples of such interactions include Coulomb force between electrons in atoms, or the gravity between planets. In quantum mechanics, the basic theory of almost all particles, perturbation theory is applied to motion of electrons in atoms. When these interactions are weak, perturbation theory provides a good approximation to the dynamics of the system. Despite its success, perturbation theory only considers the first order changes in variables as a function of another variable. For example, if I sit in a chair and ask you how I am related to the height of the chair, you would only need to consider my height and the height of the floor to accurately answer how I am related to the height of the chair.

We find that, for a wide range of physically plausible parameters, these fields exist as stable configurations, rather than being plagued by magnetic instability. We also find that such fields modify the structure of neutron stars, and have impacts on their cooling behavior. Our results provide new insights into the nature of some magnetars, as well as offering new mechanisms for radio emission from these objects. Neutron stars are among the most exotic objects in the universe. They are leftover objects from the death of massive stars. They are as heavy as the moon but much more dense, being averages of several kilometers of matter packed into a volume of a few kilometers. Their interior, the so-called  nuclear sphere,  is rich in neutrons, almost half of the volume being comprised of neutrons held together with the strong force. This neutron matter is the most dense matter in the universe, similar in density to a large tumor on a human being. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a  deep crust,  essentially a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, and finally an outer layer of hydrogen and helium. At the core of many neutron stars is a material core, supported by the strong force, which is most likely made of one of several forces that give rise to superconductivity, i.e, Fermi, Coorbital, U(1) or colour superconductivity. Type II superconductivity occurs in metals at low temperatures. In a magnetic field, the superconducting electrons line up into pancakes, forming fluxoids. The resulting field is maximal at the mid-plane of the star and tapers off near the surface. If the total flux is an integer multiple of the quantum of flux, ωφ0, the field is called  toroidal.  Depending on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the condensation energy, this field is either stable or unstable. In this work, we study a subset of the stable solutions, those with integral flux quanta. We find that the ratio of the toroidal field energy to the rest of the star goes as the fifth power of the field strength, so there is little free energy in the field at typical neutron star fields. The field lines then naturally bundle in flux bundles of integral quanta. For a strong enough magnetic field, there is a discontinuity in the poloidal magnetic field, and the field is called force-free. This situation arises when there is a magnetic field-induced modification to the equation of state for the superconductor, so the magnetic and condensation energies are not in balance. A toroidal field modifies the structure of a neutron star in two primary ways. The magnetic pressure is enhanced in the core, increasing the pressure even as the density drops.

One possible approach consists in introducing some modeled correlation between the fluctuations of the Reynolds-Averaged-Variable (RAV) and the instantaneous Reynolds stress. Among all the possible correlation tensors, the one ensuring the maximum Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS)equation-consistent (RA Conserving) is often chosen, see e.g.  1  for a review.

If we extrapolate the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest possible energies, we expect the particle exchanges to involve gravitons, which could explain the observed gravity, and, possibly, also photons and fermions.

We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region. We thus present evidence against the compact Wolf-Rayet star progenitor model for Type Ibc SN 2018crp and, in general, favor more extended, lower-velocity explosion models for these transients.

Mergers between galaxies are important for galaxy evolution, because they can bring in new material, angular momentum, and, perhaps, new satellite galaxies. Observational searches for satellites have traditionally been difficult, because they are easily disrupted or removed by the galactic environment. N-body simulations have proved to be a powerful tool for predicting the frequency and properties of satellite galaxies, but predictions still require observationally-informed scaling with the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been identified in cosmological dark matter simulations, without including the baryonic physics that would likely disrupt them. In this work we use a set of zoomed-in, high-resolution cosmological simulations to examine the relation between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. We find a strong dependence of the survival of satellite galaxies on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, and on their orbital parameters. Satellite galaxies that are on highly eccentric orbits are much more likely to survive for several crossing times than those on more circular orbits. Satellites on prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those on retrograde orbits, and satellites on highly radial orbits are more likely to survive than those on low-radius orbits. Satellite galaxies that form near the center of their host are more likely to survive than those that form far from the center. We also find that the internal structures of galaxies, as measured by their phase-space structure, are a better predictor of the fate of satellites than their dark matter halos. In particular, satellites that are either on radial orbits or on highly eccentric orbits will have large amounts of stars stripped from their outer parts. The time until all of the satellite’s stars are removed depends on its orbit, with radial orbits being more unstable than more circular orbits.

By performing state-of-the-art dust formation and evolution simulations, we find that silicate dust grains formed in the P31 ejecta can survive for a Hubble time and be injected into the surrounding early Interstellar Medium (ISM). These dust grains can then grow via accretion of metals from the presolar ISM to form nanometer-sized particles. We also find that titanium and vanadium are the most abundant elements at the grain surface and that the overall stoichiometry is roughly Ti-26V-4Si, with a high sulfur to oxygen atomic ratio of 0.5-1.5%. These sulfur-rich compositions are distinctive from those of chondritic meteorites and are most consistent with carbon-rich pebble materials, such as enstatite andagnetite, as injected dust precursors. We conclude that the P31 supernova remnant, as observed and modeled here, provides a rich platform to test theoretical predictions of dust formation and subsequent evolution.

Due to their relatively large size and high degree of stiffness, bottlebrush polymers are often unable to adapt to the irregularities in their embedding environments, and consequently exhibit inadequate processability and function in solution or the solid state. The problem of stiffness can be mitigated by incorporating chemically crosslinkable side chains on the bottlebrush, thereby allowing the brush segments to be crosslinked once for a global change in the stiffness of the brush. However, the brush and crosslinker segments then come into close proximity, and in the absence of specific non-covalent interactions, may undergo crosslinking, even at low degrees of conversion. Here we show that mutual interaction between the brush and crosslinker segments – namely π-π interaction between the side chain polymers and Flory-Huggins interaction between the fluorocarbon and carbon backbone polymers – leads to crosslinking-induced softening of the brush stiffness. This approach allows independent control of stiffness and processability of bottlebrush polymers through appropriate selection of non-covalent and covalent interactions. The approach is validated by rheological and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a bottlebrush polymer in which the brush is formed by ethyloxazoline monomers and the side chains are formed by tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TMSSI). Mutual interaction between TMSSI side chains and ethyloxazoline brush segments leads to a large decrease in the bottlebrush stiffness without a significant change in the weight average molecular weight. A novel two-step crosslinking approach is developed that enables gradual and controllable crosslinking of the TMSSI side chains in a spatially and temporally decoupled manner from global crosslinking of the ethyloxazoline brush segments.

Date: 2023 Author: Yosuke Kimura Title: Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stationary, spherically symmetric black hole in de Sitter space with a constant positive curvature. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Hawking radiation and the Bunch-Davies vacuum, and find that the de Sitter horizon is a effective change of the vacuum. We also consider the small mass case, and calculate the particle creation rate and the energy flux near the horizon. We find that the energy flux becomes a positive number even in de Sitter space, which violates the cosmic no-hair conjecture. Why do we care about Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces? The AdS/CFT correspondence, which was proposed by M. M. Roberts, V. A. Hubeny, C. Ranganathan, and E. funcatsbooks.com, relates a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to a conformal field theory in physical space-time. Since then, there have been many studies of quantum effects in AdS spaces, such as black holes and cosmological horizons. One reason to study the effects of quantum gravity in AdS spaces is to understand the higher-dimensional gravity itself from a view point of the lower-dimensional CFT. On the other hand, the cosmological constant in the universe is very tiny but non-zero. It has been suggested that quantum effects of the gravity could generate a positive cosmological constant. This means that the AdS space corresponds to an inflationary universe. Thus, studying quantum effects in AdS spaces provides a possible way to explain the very small but non-zero cosmological constant. However, the AdS spaces have a time-like curvature, and thus the physics in the boundary CFT does not have a time direction. This means that, since the Hawking radiation is a process from the past of the boundary, it does not affect the CFT. Thus, one cannot discuss the Cosmic No Hair conjecture from the AdS/CFT correspondence. The cosmic no-hair conjecture is that black holes in an expanding universe should have the same conserved quantities as the universe. So, it is desirable to study the Hawking radiation in AdS spaces in",

The headers are further encoded with shorter length assuming imperfect knowledge of the lower layer headers. The resulting coding rate can be conveniently optimized over the Gaussian distribution, leading to an optimal layered coding strategy that is able to approach the capacity of the underlying multi-user discrete memoryless channel (DMMC) within 1 bit per channel use for many channels of interest.

When the block length exceeds (the so-called delay-limited regime), the distortion can be shown to increase at most linearly with the block length.

This instability manifests itself as thinning and branching of the flame, forming a complex pattern, which can be observed with naked eye in bright light. We have obtained three remarkable features of the photonic flame by means of high-speed camera observation. First, there is a short delay between the moment when the temperature gradient appears at the tip of the branch and the moment when this tip starts to emit light. Such behaviour can be observed in the videoclip linked in the text. Second, it is possible to trigger the flame branches by local heating from the nearby ignited wire. It is also observed in the videoclip. Third, if a stable flame tip is illuminated from behind by a sufficiently bright light, then this light can  reflect  from the front surface of the flame.

For this, we consider both the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation and the two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations with finite resistivity.

We have demonstrated that excitation of electromagnetically non-dispersive shock waves is possible even in an isotropic plasma, i.e. when the electron flow velocity and the magnetic field have equal amplitudes. By means of numerical simulations, we have found that this phenomenon is possible due to the symmetry breaking effect, namely, if the plasma is uniformly magnetized in one direction, it is possible to generate electromagnetic shock waves with any direction in the isotropic plasma. Additionally, we have shown that in the framework of the NLS and MHD equations, it is possible to generate electromagnetic wave-like solitons when the flow velocity and magnetic field are of different amplitudes.

An organism s response to danger can have profound consequences for its fitness. Animals often adjust their behavior in response to aversive stimuli such as intense heat or severe injury. Here, we present a neurodynamical model that captures the learning and decision-making processes that underlie such behavioral plasticity. Our framework assigns a value to each behavioral response based on a probabilistic mapping to outcomes, represented as a multivariate normal distribution. These values are updated by means of a variant of contrastive estimation that enables the model to account for both positive and negative reinforcement. The model can be applied to a broad class of behavioral optimization problems, and we illustrate its application by applying it to scenarios that pose conflicting demands on a creature s behavior. The model predicts that rats exposed to a danger stimulus will exhibit an initial rapid behavioral response but will ultimately optimize their behavior, as measured by time-averaged heat loss, over a gradually shifting optimum. Furthermore, we show that the model can account for heat-induced analgesia, one of the most striking examples of behavioral plasticity, by computing a probability distribution over expected pain intensities.

In this scenario, the observable universe is viewed as a three-brane that is a domain wall living in the AdS space. In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced. This field, called the chameleon field, couples to the world volume of the brane via the Israel coupling, where the coupling strength is related to the brane tension. By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass. With explicit breaking, the scalar masses can be naturally of order one, if some conditions are satisfied on the soft parameters. Our results suggest that in order to explain the 4D gravity we live in from the 5D fundamental theory, the theory might be supersymmetric on the brane.

We have monitored their eclipse timings for many years and detect different trends in their binary orbits. After combining our data with earlier results, we are able to determine an empirical relation between the binary period and the average time interval between consecutive eclipses.

Perez arXiv.org eprint arXiv:1603.00711   physics.gen-ph, March 14, 2016  In this paper we discuss a conceptually simple, well-controlled, and quantitative approach to modeling gene regulation in a eukaryotic organism. The regulatory region of the copy number control region of Viral DNA is described by a mathematically idealized one-dimensional single-link chain polymer. Individual viral genomes occupy sites on this one-dimensional chain and exert a positional effect on the rate of transcription initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme. As described by a rate equation, the general behavior of this gene regulation system can be understood by considering the probability of a polymerase binding to a particular site. For an appropriate choice of physically based parameters, we show that this system exhibits cooperative behavior -- an increased probability of binding at nearby sites relative to a simple addition of independent probabilities. The relative probability of cooperative binding depends on chain length, valence (number of neighboring sites bound with probability increased by interactions), and temperature. We discuss implications of our observations for biological systems. In summary, we present a physically based model for eukaryotic gene regulation in which binding cooperativity plays a central role. This physical concept, which has long been of interest in other biological systems, here reveals its importance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model is distinguished from others by its clear physical basis and a quantitative description of its behavior. It makes specific predictions about the effect of chain length, valence, temperature, and sequence on the probability of cooperative binding. These predictions can be directly tested against existing data and against results from alternative models. Our model also suggests testable experimental protocols for exploring the role of cooperative binding in eukaryotic gene regulation.

        "original_text": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) configuration consisting of a MgO barrier layer sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers ( tunneling layer and reference layer ) provide the means for recording high density magnetic memories and magnetic logic. In conventional (CPP) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the spin-polarized current flowing across the interface between the ferromagnet and the tunnel junction leads to a spin-transfer torque (STT) that can rotate the magnetic direction of the free ferromagnetic layer. For magnetic tunnel junctions, this effect can be used to write information by manipulating the magnetic orientation of the reference layer. Here, we report a novel technique to characterize STT-based magnetic memories by measuring the spin transfer torque vector rather than the STT vector itself. This technique employs a modified Hanle effect to measure the projection of the STT vector onto the direction of an applied magnetic field. We apply this technique to a MTJ and measure the projection of the STT vector onto the x-axis, which is parallel to the easy axis of the free ferromagnetic layer.

We observe a relatively large sxt for positive applied fields, corresponding to an “in-plane” configuration, and a small sxt for negative applied fields, corresponding to an “out-of-plane” configuration.

        "original_text": "In this paper, we present cosmological solutions in superstring theory with positive vacuum energy and positive spatial curvature. These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory. This paper is a preliminary investigation of inflation from superstrings. There are many interesting open questions that we have not yet considered. For example, if we also wish to obtain a period of $N$th order inflation, with $N$ being larger than two, the analysis will require a more careful treatment of higher order corrections to the superpotential and Kähler potential. We also need to consider a range of various moduli and extranet field values, as well as the dependence on the full string theory landscape. Another important question is the effect of moduli stabilization on the vacuum energy and the possibility of obtaining realistic cosmology. The proposed collider signatures also need to be modified in the full superstring theory framework. Thus, although this paper presents a novel possibility for obtaining inflationary cosmology from superstrings, we recognize that more work needs to be done to realize this possibility in practice.

        "original_text": "This paper defines universal invariants for higher K-theory and higher signatures, and demonstrates their relevance by determining higher K-theory of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups. These universal invariants satisfy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, a calculation of the fundamental group, and the universal coefficients theorem. In this framework, the strong Novikov conjecture, which states that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are universal among degree-one cohomology classes, is equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This implies that the higher K-groups satisfy the Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, under certain hypotheses, also detect exotic elements in the stable homology of manifolds. We also establish twisted versions of these universal invariants and apply them to the Bismut intersection formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants extends to other stable homotopy theories, such as bordism and generalized cohomology. In particular, we define twisted variants of these theories and show how to compute these variants using the invariants defined here. This approach unifies the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a single universal theory of stable derived functors. In particular, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory arises as the key element in the localization process. In addition to defining this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also calculate its rationalization. This provides a powerful way to determine the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we propose a framework for studying twisted stable homotopy theories in which various structures, such as vector bundles and operators, are replaced by connective coverings and corresponding universal invariants. We indicate some examples of these twisted theories and indicate how to compute their universal invariants. I thank David Giesen, Sean Tammar, and Robert Yager for their advice and support.

        "original_text": "A popular supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenario is the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), in which the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) assumption is made about the initial conditions of the soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters. In this scenario, the parameters of the CMSSM are fully determined by just four input parameters: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu). Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters. The global best-fit point for the CMSSM is found for m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(mu) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(mu) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. Thus, we observe that, within the context of the CMSMS, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is very significant, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the LHC LHC phenomenological realm, with larger values of MLsp yielding a more constrained LHC phenomenology. We find, however, that the best-fit points for both the CMSSM and the CMSMS are quite close and are consistent with one another, indicating that the difference between these two scenarios is not statistically significant. The values of the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu), that are preferred by current experimental data within the context of the CMSSM are also consistent with those favored by current data in the CMSMS.

The model includes three parts: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and the interaction between the two. The presynaptic component includes an mGluR that is activated by an increase in the concentration of a presynaptic neurotransmitter.

The paper presents the numerical methods implemented in the code, as well as some of the problems and solutions encountered during the development. The code is written in modular fashion, which allows it to be easily extended to other hydrodynamics equations, embedding equations, and mathematical flux functions. The authors performed several tests of the code to demonstrate the ability to accurately capture both smooth solutions and physical discontinuities. The results are in good agreement with the exact solutions and published literature for various hydrodynamics equations. WHAM is available at https://bitbucket.org/carrerr/wham.

The dynamics of a viscous fluid may be described by the hydrodynamic equations: the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of fluid mass; the fluid velocity, which is the statement of Newton s law of motion, and an appropriate velocity specification such as no flow across boundaries (no slip) or in canals (zero shear); and the conservation of momentum, which is the statement of force production due to contact friction and other sources not already included in the fluid mass equation.

General relativity is one of the most comprehensive and successful descriptions of the laws of physics, accounting for all known forms of energy, including mass-energy and matter, electromagnetic, and nuclear energy.

The theory arose from attempts to reconcile the Ideas of Isaac Newton regarding an universal and singularly elegant theory of gravity with the correct description of the movements of the planets and stars. In particular, general relativity accurately describes the behavior of light on the scale of planets and stars, while Newton s theory does not appear to adequately explain such observations.

In this approach, the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is employed to generate or detect spin polarization, and the ferromagnetism can be used for information storage. The first realized application of bipolar spintronics is the observation of spin hall effect in 1977. Since then, intensive studies have been conducted in this field, and various applications have been proposed, including the anomalous hall effect, pure spin current injection, and spintronics-based logic. This paper gives an overview of bipolar spintronics, from spin injection to spin-controlled logic. ****** IMPORTANT NOTICE ********** If you are writing a scientific paper, please consider citing some of the preliminary research that you build upon.

Journal of Applied Physics, 116(7), p. 074302. In this paper, we give an overview of bipolar spintronics, from spin injection to spin-controlled logic. We start with a brief introduction to spin and the formulation of spin Hall effect. Then we discuss the discovery and early experimental study of spin Hall effect, including the anomalous hall effect, spin rectification, and spin pumping. The latter two effects have been recognized as an important foundation for subsequent studies of spin transport and applications. We present the theoretical models for spin Hall effect based on the classical mechanics and spin drift-diffusion equations. These models are the basis for further analytical and numerical studies of the spin transport. The experiments and theoretical investigations of spin pumping in thin magnetic films are overviewed. Then, we present the experimental studies of anomalous hall effect and spin rectification in thin films. The role of topological term in the anomalous hall effect is discussed. The spin rectification through spin mixing and transmission is also reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of these two effects in applications are also compared. The formation of topological phases for the electron system with spin-orbit interaction is also presented. The topological spin, anomalous and topological Hall effects are all related to this topological phase. We then discuss the injection of spin current in terms of the spin Hall effect. The direct observation of spin Hall effect in metallic systems is overviewed. We also present the spin Hall effect in semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, and topological insulators. The recent discovery of surface states in topological insulators is overviewed. The methods for detection of spin accumulation are then discussed.

        "original_text": "Massive black holes exist in all massive galaxies. They grow over time due to accretion of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. It is suggested that the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation can be used as a new standard for estimating the black hole mass.

It is well-known that such theories can be obtained from the Lagrangian formulation of the celebrated Euler equation on the diffeomorphism group of a three dimensional Riemannian manifold. An equivalent Hamiltonian description using the theory of Lie groupoids and Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groupoids is proposed, and explicit constructions are given for some important special cases including fluid dynamics on Lie groups, Newtonian gravity on the special orthogonal group and the general linear group, and the classical ECSK theory of non-relativistic gravity. In the Hamiltonian description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics are described by a Lie groupoid, with the fluid dynamics being a particular case in which the source of the gauge groupoid morphism is the diffeomorphism group of the fluid domain. In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization.

        "original_text": "The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is a powerful method to analyze the behavior of gravitation in systems consisting of compact objects. The first post-Newtonian approximation (1PN) of general relativity (GR) was constructed by Einstein and Rosen in 1932. Scalar-tensor theory (STT) generalizes GR by generalizing the graviton into a more general scalar field, leading to additional gravitational degrees of freedom. The most general STT action consistent with general covariance and single-scalar-fieldsymmetry is that of Horndeski. In 1981, Deffayet et al. found a novel class of scalar-tensor theories, known as scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling (STT NGC ), which differ from general STT by the form of the coupling function. To first order in the usual PN parameter ( = GM/(rc^2)), where M and r are the mass and distance of the system, respectively, and G is the Gravitational constant, the equations of motion for a two-body system in general STT NGC  differ from those of GR only by 2.5PN order, because the self-coupling of the scalar field enters at 1.5PN order. In 2015, Brax et al. showed that a special case of STT NGC  called scalar-tensor-relativistic theory (STR) is a good approximation to general STT in a large class of spherically symmetric solutions, dubbed nearly solutions. To zeroth order in the usual PN parameter, the equation of motion for a nearly spherically symmetric system in STR is fourth order and reduces to the ordinary Emden equation, whose solutions are exact scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with a finite horizon. In this Letter we consider the slow motion of particles around such black holes and compare the resulting scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Hamiltonians with the ones of GR. We find that: i) in the 1.5PN and 2PN orders, the first terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR differ from those of GR, respectively, by scalar and Gauss-Bonnet topological invariants; ii) the 1PN terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR are proportional to the square of the absolute value of the Det of the spatial metric. Henceforth, these invariants vanish for black holes in Einstein gravity. In conclusion, we have obtained the 2PN approximation of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity.",

        "original_text": "A method to determine the electronic structure of single dopant atoms in silicon carbide using scanning probe microscopy is presented. As dopant atoms have different lattice structure from the host semiconductor, they may offer novel opportunities to investigate quantum systems at low temperature. Here we demonstrate this concept by employing an electrically-tunable scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to locally modify the electronic structure of a single atom of SiC. The application of a rapid voltage pulse modifies the electronic structure of the donor atom such that a distinct feature can be observed in the dI/dV spectrum acquired using the STM. This approach could enable electrical detection and control of individual dopants in silicon carbide, paving the way for investigations of quantum states in nanoscale devices and development of atomic-scale sensors with these novel properties. The control and study of individual dopants in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) offers the exciting possibility of tailoring nanoscale devices to have novel quantum properties. A single dopant atom has been shown to provide an opportunity to investigate a quantum system at low temperature. For example, the phosphorus atom is a well-studied donor atom which has been used to demonstrate the spin of a single phosphorus atom electron and investigate electron quantum tunneling in this system. However, probing the electronic structure of a single dopant atom in real time with high spatial resolution has remained a significant experimental challenge. In this work, we employ a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to locally modify the electronic structure of a single atom of 4H-SiC. The modification of the electronic structure of a single atom allows for electrical detection and control of individual dopants in silicon carbide. As an example, we apply rapid voltage pulses to the STM to locally change the electronic structure of a single donor atom. A distinct feature in the dI/dV spectrum is observed when the donor atom’s electronic structure is modified. We characterize the modification of the electronic structure of the donor atom and its influence on the dI/dV spectrum. This approach allows for electrical detection and control of individual dopants in silicon carbide, paving the way for investigations of quantum states in nanoscale devices and development of atomic-scale sensors with these novel properties.",

Noteworthy, two recent high-throughput RNA sequencing studies have revealed that up to 98% of eukaryotic genomes are transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). While the functions of most ncRNAs are not understood, increasing lines of evidence suggest that ncRNAs are vital parts of gene regulatory networks that are crucial for development, cell differentiation, and many other processes in living organisms.

        "original_text": "The so-called ’dark energy’ is believed to be responsible for the recent acceleration of the universe’s expansion. Independent observations of this phenomena have only been available since the late 2000s, so when exactly the universe started to accelerate has been a subject of significant debate. In this paper, we use a suite of different datasets to measure the timing of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. We find that while there is a high degree of agreement on the average transition time, the precision with which it has been determined is highly dependent on the choice of dataset used. Our findings indicate that cosmologists may have overestimated the uncertainty in the timing of the transition, with the impact on the design of future dark energy surveys being discussed. The acceleration of the cosmic expansion was first observed in the late 2000s, and since then its cause has been a subject of intense study. Indirect evidence for this phenomenon, based on measurements of the cosmological parameters, only became available during the past decade. Consequently, the question of precisely when the expansion started to accelerate has been a topic of debate. In this paper we consider this question using a suite of different datasets, and find that while there is good agreement on the average transition time, the precision with which it has been determined is highly dependent on the choice of dataset used. Our findings indicate that cosmologists have overestimated the uncertainty in the timing of the transition, with the impact on the design of future dark energy surveys being discussed.

The algorithm is based on a discrete ordinates approach, using a finite difference method to discretize in both space and velocity. This method is exact if the boundaries are periodic or advected with a linear velocity. We show that it is also consistent if the advection speed is linearly interpolated between the cell center and the boundary. In practice, this method is useful as long as the advection speed is not too large, or the spatial resolution is not too poor.

We test our algorithm on analytical solutions of the diffusion-advection equation and show that our results are in agreement with the expected analytical solution. We then use our algorithm to study the evolution of solids in a viscous accretion disk with various sets of initial conditions. In all cases, solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale. In the second part, we study the effect of solids on the dust evolution in the disk.

In this work, we present new HESRG data on the enigmatic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, whose 2006 outburst has historically been among the most energetic witnessed in the modern era. We interpret our data within the framework of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) to cosmic-rays, and we make a number of novel inferences. We find that the electrons and ions can be well-fitted by a single power-law of common index -2.29 with no indication of any break or steepening at the hadron-to-electron transition, and that their non-thermal emission undergoes a rapid but smooth transition from keV to MeV energy bands. From comparison with nonlinear DSA theory, we deduce that electrons are most likely accelerated to 300 TeV - 1 EeV via magnetic reconnection events within a high-speed magnetospheric outflow from the binary system, whilst ions are accelerated to 30 GeV - 1 TeV, within a slower but more-diffuse wind. We finally compare our results with previous predictions from the light-echo observations of the 2010 outburst of RS Ophiuchi - with which we likewise detect non-thermal emission - and find excellent agreement for electron energies but substantial tension for ion energies.

        "original_text": "The article aims to overview the recent development in the understanding of cosmological shock waves. These are fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in an abrupt change of properties of a fluid, usually characterized by a supersonic flow jump. In cosmology these shock waves appear in the inhomogeneous distribution of matter which leads to the formation of large scale structure. There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the cosmological shock wave phenomenon. This is because new observational discoveries such as the 511 keV line, and highly contrasted galaxy clusters have shown the need to go beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. In the cosmological world, there is more variation in the matter density and velocity fields than what would be expected from a simple homogenous and isotropic model. It is now known that type 2 shock waves are generic features of cosmological fluid flows. Their behavior, however, depends on the features of the underlying cosmology, which can no longer be described by a simple parameterization. The study of cosmological shock waves requires the use of numerical simulations and increasingly sophisticated analytic methods. The article is organized as follows. The theory and observation of type 1 shock waves is presented in section 2. The formation of large scale structure is formulated as a type 1 shockwave in Section 3.

In this study, we present far-infrared and submillimeter data from the Herschel Space Observatory, as well as molecular line and radio continuum data from the data archives, to characterize the star-forming content of W3.

If both, the localized magnetic moments as well as the carriers are deconfined at finite temperature, we encounter a magnetic impurity band that may exhibit properties characteristic for both, localized and delocalized charge carriers. In order to understand the nature of the impurity band we study for the case of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) the crossover from localized to delocalized charge carriers via a systematic variation of the Coulomb attraction by the acceptor. In this context the physical concept of Wannier functions is employed to describe the spatial extent and localizability of the impurity band wave functions.

        "original_text": "Fermi’s golden rule (FGR) is an intuitive principle for understanding the rates of quantum system evolution. It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model. Our analysis shows that the FGR cannot be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework. We also propose an alternative perspective on the quantum dynamical phase transition, and show that QDPT exists only for the classical system, and does not exist in the limit of quantum system. Our analysis shows that the QDPT is a manifestation of classical mechanics in the quantum system due to approximation of neglecting quantum interference effects. Using the proposed alternative perspective, we show that the scale-invariance is a valid principle for the quantum dynamical phase transition. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism of quantum dynamical phase transition in the classical limit, and suggests that the scale-invariance is not a fundamental symmetry of the quantum system, but a long-distance emergent behavior in the classical limit.",

While the total top quark cross section has been measured by both experiments to be consistent with the SM expectation, with a global significance of 2.9 standard deviations, there are several anomalous observations which have been reported: the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry by both CDF and D0, the total cross section for top-antitop production, and the production of a single top quark in association with a W boson.

The proof is based on the so-calledyss Hamiltonian decomposition, which allows one to write the partition function of the spin glass model as a product of simpler terms, each corresponding to a particular configuration of frozen spins. The nature of the frozen spins implies that the couplings between corresponding terms in the Ising and spin glass models are positive, and thus the whole product has to be positive, allowing us to restrict the consideration to positive Boltzmann weights, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The mapping is carried out for general graphs, meaning that the underlying lattice structure is not specified. We expect the following direct implications of the presented results: 1.

        "original_text": "Turbulent flows are often characterized by the assumption of locality, where the kinematics and dynamics are largely separable in space and time. In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady. This provides a useful framework for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows, and has important implications for the dynamics of clusters in highly compressible turbulent flows such as those arising in the atmosphere and fusion plasma simulations.",

The obtained data were analyzed in the time domain as well as in the frequency domain. The obtained results show that the source underwent several flux state transitions, exhibited timing irregularities and a broad band noise component at lower frequencies. For the first time, we were able to detect quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) at 27.6 s and 60.4 mHz. The high frequency QPO is most likely a Keplerian frequency at the compact object s warped magnetosphere. The low frequency QPO could be a neutron star s frequency group.

In the present data set, the source was observed to be in the hard state for almost the entire monitoring period, with only short periods of time in the soft state. The transitions between the different flux states as well as timing irregularities observed in the source s timing behavior could be the result of a changing geometry of the source s magnetic field.

We consider a general initial condition, allowing the walker to have any fractional part, and prove that the quantum walker will settle in finite time into a pure quantum state with real eigenvalue density equal to 1. We also consider the classical analogous of this walk, where at each time step, the walker may choose to step to the left or right with some probability. While the classical walk is transient in general, we prove that for sufficiently small alpha, the classical walk will always settle into a periodic configuration. We present a numerical simulation of the time-dependent behavior of both the quantum and classical self-interacting walks. As a further application of our techniques, we prove that the quantum walk converges in distribution to the classical walk.

Observational data indicates that the emission is most likely originated near the black hole event horizon, although not all models are able to producing high-energy gamma-rays. Emission mechanisms in blazars are uncertain. A popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek process in which the magnetized central black hole powers the jet by extracting spin energy of the black hole. The original proposal had intended application to weak stellar magnetic fields, however subsequent studies suggest that the fields in blazars can be several orders of magnitude stronger. Another popular model is synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) in which synchrotron radiation up-scatters part of its own photons to high energy gamma-rays. Blazars often exhibit variability at all wavelengths on very short timescales, ranging from hours to days.

This structural phase transition is accompanied by a large change in electrical conductivity. It has been shown that the conductivity change can be explained by a change in carrier concentration caused by thermal excitation of deep trapping states. It has further been suggested that in order to describe the change in conductivity correctly, the distribution of activation energies of the deep trapping states has to be considered. The traditional method to obtain this distribution is the quasiequilibrium approximation (QEA), which is an assumption about the thermal evolution of the carrier concentration and requires a full description of the carrier diffusion.

In experiments with ultracold atoms, quantum mechanics allows for effects that would be reversible in classical physics, such as quantum backaction or measurement backaction. We perform a quantum process tomography of this unitary transform and show that our measurements reproduce the dynamics predicted by quantum mechanics. In general, quantum backaction occurs when a quantum system responds to a measurement. Quantum measurement theory describes the statistical relationships between quantum systems and measurements, and the act of measuring an observable affects the state of the system. Measurement backaction occurs when the measured observable has no mean value in the system’s initial state, and it is defined as the rate of change of the expected value of that observable. It can have a variety of forms. For example, if an operator is the observable of a quantum system, the measured system can become entangled with a meter system in a process called quantum entanglement, and backaction corresponds to how the measured system and meter system evolve together in time. Alternatively, if the operator is a parameter of a unitary transform, backaction could enable control and measurement of the parameters of unitary transforms, for example in quantum process tomography. Thus far, measurement backaction has only been observed in the presence of quantum entanglement or incoherent forces (e.g., gravity or the spin-force associated with magnetic fields). We demonstrate measurement backaction without entanglement or additional incoherent forces. Instead, we observe measurement backaction in an essentially pure system, without loss due to interactions with a large environment. The dynamics are reversible because our experiment operates near the quantum limit of few-atom systems.

In order to monitor the energy and momentum conservation over such long time periods, switchings of various force fields become necessary. In this work we present a general algorithm for the energy and momentum conservation in MD simulations using force fields with switching potentials. The general case is considered. The switching potentials are obtained from analytical solutions of the corresponding equations of motion. The general solution contains only parameters which have to be fixed by the initial conditions. Therefore, the proposed method is easy to apply and inexpensive in computational terms. We illustrate the efficiency of the approach on the example of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. Applying the proposed algorithm, we obtain the results of the energy and momentum conservation over 600000 time steps of the LJ system with a relatively low cost, which is ~27% of the cost for the same time step with the conventional algorithm.",

It consists of an ensemble of non-interacting vortices, with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well-defined packets of each vortex sign. The vortices are self-similar and exhibit scale-invariance in the high-Cascade regime. In this paper, we develop a simplified 2D dynamical model that captures the essential features of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of the vorticity, Omega, is modeled by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Dissipation of enstrophy arises primarily through two distinct processes: direct viscosity, which leads to local smoothing of the vorticity field, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from near-core vortical zones to outer regions. We demonstrate that these two processes lead to a scaling solution with time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, in agreement with the dynamical model. We then show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is controlled by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions. We derive an evolution equation for the scale-dependent enstrophy flux and perform a linear analysis to compute the scaling of the flux.

We give an explicit infinitely generated subgroup of the first reduced cohomology group. We also study the second reduced cohomology group with coefficients in certain finite dimensional representation. We prove that this second cohomology group is zero in some cases, and give an upper bound for it in other cases. As an application we show that the mapping class group of a surface of large genus has infinite cohomological dimension. We also study the cohomology with local coefficients. We describe the cohomology groups with local coefficients in the regular representation in some special cases. We show that the local cohomology group with local coefficients in the regular representation is isomorphic to the incidence cohomology of the corresponding Artin group, generalizing the result of Mimura and Toda for the classical Artin groups. We also calculate the cohomology with local coefficients in the standard representation in some special cases. Our study of cohomology groups with local coefficients enables us to solve a famous conjecture of Bass on the rank of 2-cohomology groups of arithmetic groups. More precisely, we prove that if the corresponding Zariski closure of an arithmetic group has no simple factors of exceptional type, then the rank of 2-cohomology group of this arithmetic group is divisible by 2 and by the constant part of itsbsd fixer. We also discuss the combinatorics of these cohomology groups with local coefficients, in particular the effect of the schensted correspondence on these cohomology groups. Finally, we give a new realization of the canonical mixed building of the special orthogonal group as a non-symmetric space, which enables us to calculate the cohomology of the special orthogonal group using the corresponding result for the orthogonal group. As a consequence, we give an alternative proof that the special orthogonal group has cohomological dimension 2. In this paper, all representations are complex representations.

The evolution of magnetic fields has been relatively understudied in comparison to the evolution of other stellar properties such as mass, radius, and rotation. To study the field’s evolution, we analyzed high-resolution, spectropolarimetric observations of five active magnetic stars in the upper main sequence. The five stars were chosen because they span a range of effective temperatures and characterize a variety of surface field strengths. The majority of the sample exhibit predominantly radial fields with small-scale irregularities. Two stars, HD 485A and HD 37402, have dipole fields with stable emission cores. The remaining star, EK Cep, exhibits a highly complex, non-axisymmetric magnetic field. This star also exhibits a long-lived emission core in its longitudinal field.

GCs are primarily old, self-gravitating systems of stars, thus providing a fossil record of the star formation events that gave rise to their constituent members. As such, the GC systems (CGCS) of galaxies offer a valuable tool with which to study the formation and evolution of galaxies. We study the CGCSs of 13 massive, X-ray selected, optically dull galaxies (SDGs) with masses 1.3 - 4.5 x 10 11 M⊙, redshifts z = 0.02 - 0.33, and 13 - 105 Gyr of age using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/G band images. We find that 7 of these SDGs exhibit bimodal or multimodal GC systems. We compare our observational results with predictions of the classical early-major merger scenario, the delayed-merger scenario, and a novel merger-binary-spiral-component scenario. We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of pathways. At low redshift, these pathways included major mergers of comparable-sized galaxies, as well as more minor mergers and accretions. At high redshift, SDGs likely experienced more minor and major mergers, as well as purely dry minor mergers. However, we suggest that the late-stage mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies formed the dense central GC systems of the SDGs. The lack of strong rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-richness of these mergers. In this scenario, we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify 3 such galaxies. Using our spatially resolved color data, we show that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with the fraction of young stars increasing with distance from the center of the galaxy. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more extended than that of the old stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected distances within which half of the GC system’s GCs are found) and power-law slopes consistent with the predictions of recent major merger and purely dry minor merger scenarios, respectively.

Concurrently, emerging market indicators point to increasing returns in several sectors, including transportation, finance, and waste management. These increasing returns may reflect granular heterogeneities, e.g. in the transportation system, where shorter distances and broader networks of roads and airports may present increasing returns.

        "original_text": "In this paper we show that a four-dimensional brane world, residing in an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions, can be realized without the need for a discrete symmetry. As an explicit example, we show that a brane world in six space-time dimensions with an adjoint scalar field, where the scalar develops a VEV along the space time direction can be constructed. The model presented has no discrete symmetries, and is hence potentially realistic. It provides a self sustaining late-time cosmology that can explain the near epoch expansion of the universe, and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without the need for a cosmological inflationary period. Our model has a large number of arbitrary parameters, however we present a simple scenario in which all of these parameters are determined by a small number of parameters. The model is thus highly predictive. In particular, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane give constraints on the scale of compactification of the extra-dimensions, and the scale of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We show that current experimental bounds on these scales may be able to be achieved in the framework of our model. Additionally, we investigate the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. In particular, we show that after the spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be localized to a single 4D spatial location, while right-chiral anti- neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized over the extra-dimensions. Thus our model is not only realistic, but also solves the hot dark matter problem. Finally we discuss some of the cosmological implications of our work. In particular, we show that a 4D Friedmann equation can be obtained from our bulk theory. We present a scenario in which this dynamics, combined with the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe gives a natural explanation of the observed Hubble rate. The scenario we present is extremely simple, and has no free parameters. Moreover, it can potentially accommodate current observational constraints. This model is potentially testable in current and future experiments. Current experiments which may be able to test our model include MEG, PLANCK, and FOCUS. In the future, SHENGM7 may be able to test this scenario. Moreover, the exciting gravitational wave experiments, such as the LIGO and VIRGO, may also be able to test Lorentz invariance violation in the gravitational sector. Overall, the model presented here is extremely predictive, has no need for extra hypothesize or fine tuning, and can potentially solve the large scale structure, hot dark matter, and cosmological constant problems.",

Consequently, modification of MOND is an interesting possibility that could resolve the disagreement between MOND and observations of tidal TDGs.

Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most violent explosions in the universe.

Short-lived and beamed Gamma-Ray Bursts with known cosmological redshifts provide a crucial opportunity for studying the nature of the universe and its structure.

The first regime is characterized by a cooling break followed by a simple power law. Between two and four dissipation slopes are observed in this regime. The second regime, seen in 17 bursts, is characterized by an initial thermal component with a blackbody function or a non-thermal tail, followed by a single power law.

In this model, the amorphous solid is composed of particles interacting via a short-range, repulsive core and a long-range, attractive tail in a potential that is sheared, below the glass transition temperature, Tg, to generate an amorphous solid. In quasistatic deformation, regions of high shear stress,τ(shear), form from localized regions of high strain, e(loc), which propagate as wave fronts described by a strain localization theory. Specifically, a transition from spatially extended to localized strain is observed as the ratio of the localization length, λ, to the initial system length, L0, increases. An analytical theory describing the spatial, temporal, and frequency dependent shear modulus, G(τ,ω), and its relation to the shear stress and strain waveforms is developed, which allows for analysis of the frequency dependence of localized shear stress and strain, τ(loc)(ω) and e(loc)(ω). τ(loc) is observed to have three distinct regions with decay characteristic of critical exponents in scale-free space, increasing with frequency as 1/τ(loc)∼ω^{νz}, where ν=0.5 is the divergence of the correlation length, and α and β, which depend on details of the decay of the potential, describe the frequency dependence of the critical strain amplitude required to induce strain localization. e(loc) exhibits similar critical exponents to τ(loc) except with different critical amplitude exponents α=νz=1/2 and β=1/2. Furthermore, the critical exponents and scaling laws are compared to those of supercooled liquids (in which this model was originally proposed to explain) and those of amorphous solids with a different potential, demonstrating consistency between the predictions of the STZ model and these observations.

To this end, this paper proposes a non-Bayesian rate adaptation with two design approaches: one is the restless multi-armed bandit based approach for finding the unavailable spectrum in an automated and adaptive manner; the other is the Lyapunov optimization based approach for finding the operating point that achieves the worst average interference to the primary user. Specifically, the former adopts a large number of discrete channel states to approximate the dynamic and continuous interference levels, while the latter adapts the transmitting rate from a static to a dynamic mode according to the observation of the interference, and gradually converges to the operating point that achieves the worst average interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve near-optimal performance, in terms of both effective spectrum utilization and average interference to the primary user.",

The synthesis of Taylor screens is a harder problem than synthesis of polynomial screens since it requires the synthesis of screens with rapidly changing phases.

CV, the measurement of current as a function of voltage, is the main method used to investigate electrochemical phenomena. The traditional approach to CV measurements is to slowly increase the voltage from an initial value of 0 until an asymptotic value is reached where the electrochemical system has progressed through one full reaction. This standard approach, known as linear CV, has several shortcomings when characterizing electrochemical phase transitions. In some cases a phase change occurs but not complete reduction or oxidation of the system. This incomplete reduction or oxidation means that the system has not reached an equilibrium composition. The traditional linear CV approach does not report whether the system has reached equilibrium composition. Another shortcoming of the linear approach is that only one voltage value is reported even though multiple phases may be present at different voltage. This work develops a new approach to CV measurement, called E-C FORC, which tracks the voltage path the system takes as it progresses through multiple phases and reaches equilibrium. Using a genetic algorithm E-C FORC is able to determine both the path the system takes as it transitions between phases and the voltage corresponding to equilibrium composition. The technique is demonstrated using ferricyanide as a model electrochemical system. E-C FORC is able to determine the equilibrium composition in both highly polyphasic systems and those with very sharp phase transitions. Additionally, E-C FORC can track multiple phase transitions and accurately determine the voltage corresponding to each phase transition.

Epsilon Aurigae is the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere sky, and it is almost always visible to the naked eye.

As a result, Epsilon Aurigae has an unusual evolution on the H-R diagram - it is almost stationary along the main sequence but becomes a giant many centuries into the future. Historical estimates of the star s distance have varied considerably, from under 4 pc to over 14 pc, and recent high-precision parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite gave a distance of 11.65 pc. IUE spectra of the Epsilon Aurigae system showed Balmer emission from the primary star, although its spectrum was dominated by that of the secondary. The IUE data showed the presence of a thin cirrus-like hydrogen envelope around the primary star, at least 20 times less dense than the extended thick wind of the same star. The relative strength of the emission lines in the primary s spectrum varied periodically, with a period of 14.4 days - the rotation period of the primary star.

The latter results in the formation of localised lumps which act as topological defects. Depending on the initial conditions, the system can evolve into two distinct states.

We prove that the nonholonomic Ricci flow, whose  potential  is the squared of the unique M-curvature, is equivalent to the nonholonomic flow envelope (NFE) for the class of vacuum Einstein equations with anholonomic variables. It means that solutions of the considered equations for the M-curvature define the same solutions of the nonholonomic Ricci flow. We prove that the considered vacuum Einstein equations with anholonomic variables define the Riemann geometry, which never Ricci flows, but only nonholonomic Ricci flows. We find the formulas for variation of some geometric objects, defining the induced nonholonomic distribution and nonlinear connection (ND) in the corresponding deformations.

        "original_text": "Spherically symmetric plasmas are an important and interesting general relativistic plasma system, which arise in, for example, collapsing stars, laboratory nuclear fusion experiments, and the early universe. The simplest spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system contains two independent functions of radial coordinate only. However, these can be reduced further to a single quadrature, allowing exact solutions to be obtained in several special cases. In general, the presence of the Maxwell field contributes one additional conserved charge, the masshair  of the solution. For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime. The resulting space-times describe either black holes with a gravitational mass, a scalar field hair, or naked singularities, depending on the choice of equations of state. In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by relating the system to a theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to a non-linear scalar field. We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties. In particular, we show how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair. Our approach has some similarity to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of some strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this respect, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above may be interpreted as a phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theory, with the black hole forming when the gauge theory approaches a large-$N$ limit in which gravity is strongly interacting, and the naked singularity forming when the gauge theory undergoes a large-$N$ transition to a low-energy weakly coupled plasma. This paper provides a rare example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system. More generally, it shows how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair.

However, it remains challenging to achieve both high storage capacities and practical electrode potentials. Here we perform a comprehensive first-principles study of the structural, electronic, and dynamical properties of potassium intercalation in graphite. Our main findings are as follows: (i) The graphite intercalation compound (GIC) forms via one-pot synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, in which potassium atoms adsorb onto defective graphene layers between two graphite sheets. (ii) Intercalation occurs without significant changes to the graphene structure or lattice parameters, but induces a sharp increase in the C—C bond length by as much as 0.39 Å. (iii) Potassium incorporation leads to a large decrease in the conduction band minimum of graphite, but only causes a small and highly dispersive increase in the valence band maximum. (iv) The dynamical stability of potassium intercalated graphite is significantly improved by eliminating interactions between potassium and the defective graphene layers. Our findings provide new design strategies for potassium-graphite intercalation batteries, and promote the development of novel two-dimensional materials for energy storage.",

        "original_text": "In this paper, we propose a fully differentiable convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can approximate arbitrary two dimensional (2D) path curves. The model, referred to as 1-layer Excitable CNN (ECC), only consists of a single layer of 1D CNN, with the convolution filters shaped in a particular fashion so as to excitable. Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs). Through carefully studying the SVD factors, we are able to identify the number of factors to equal the number of path points in a path, and thus ECC can be viewed as a dynamic lower dimensional Hankel matrix completion method. We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns. We show that ECC, with its single layer representation, is much more efficient and has much less parameters than existing 2D path curve approximation methods. We also conduct thorough experiments to analyze the influences of various factors on the path curve approximation performance of ECC. With the 1-layer ECC model and the path evolution strategy, we build an automatic path approximation pipeline which is easy to train and robust to various path types.

In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation. We find that the uncertainty from this relation is smaller than 0.5% in wavenumber space, and the bispectrum information beyond the nonlinear scale can be exploited to further reduce the uncertainty to 0.1%.

We use the Fudge Model for the nuclear reaction network, and consider both adiabatic and (steeper) isothermal expansions. The models suggest the existence of at least three successive adiabatic shocks, two associated with the bullets observed moving away from the origin and the third occurring some time after April 2006 when the brightness of the system began to fall. Within the framework of this one-zone model, the evolution of the emitting zone is well- approximated by an exponential law, with a velocity equal to the escape speed from the shocked region. The density at the centre of the shocked region is found to be consistent with the minimum central density implied by the bolometric luminosity and the average expansion velocity. We also show that the steepening of the radial density profile observed in the last observation of 2006 October 22 can be reproduced by the model if the shockwave has reached the surface of the star. We compare our results with archival observations of the outburst from various telescopes, and find that observations in the blue band during 2006 May show the system to be more luminous and also reveal some evidence for a circum- nova disk.",

        "original_text": "The recent discovery of the Schrödinger Greene method (SGM) for calculating holographic entanglement entropy (EE) in vacuum gravity backgrounds has led to the formulation of a covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal (CHSMEE). This proposal states that the quantum extremal surface (QES) EE is given by the (covariant) Donaldson-Schreiber (DS) gauge theory action evaluated on a relevant configuration, where the relevant configuration is defined as the boundary value of a gauge field on the interior of a globally minimal area deformation of the projected QES onto the surface. Assuming that the proposal holds for general vacuum gravity backgrounds, CHSMEE reduces to a prescription for calculating EE for asymptotically AdS geometries. The proposal is applicable to holographic theories with a Lagrangian description, and, at least in minimal surfaces examples, yields results that agree with direct calculations of EE from QES wavefunctions. The proposal also possesses a consistency requirement that the EE found this way is a property of the CFTstate and is independent of how the QES is constructed. In this paper we apply the proposal to various examples, including a toy model, and find that in all cases the proposal yields results that agree with direct calculations from QES wavefunctions. Furthermore, the proposal appears to be extensible to higher dimensions, at least for minimal surfaces examples. Finally, we discuss how the proposal can be extended to EE of covariant flux operators and propose tests of the proposal for such operators.",

Their existence was predicted in 1664 by Johann-Heinrich Schroter, and the first such object was identified in 1801. TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems. Although many of these observed companions are likely remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, several systems with centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects are also clearly identified. Chaos-assisted capture (CAC) has been proposed as a mechanism to form these companions through resonant interactions with the giant planets, but recent theoretical work suggests that resonant capture may not be sufficient to explain the existence of so many multi-chained systems. In this paper, we propose another mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have been members of multiple systems: fission. We show that the sudden merger of two SDOs in a near-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO thanks to an instability that creates an additional gravitational torque. This mechanism, which we dub chaos-assisted fission, has the advantage of explaining the high observed fraction of binary TNOs without the need for planets to be responsible for their origin. We show that this dynamical process is likely to occur frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, especially during close encounters. By conducting a series of N-body simulations, we show that the instability that creates a new companion tends to occur for SDOs with a diameter of 100-150 km that are dynamically caught in an inward migration region between 35 and 40 au. For the conditions typically found in the trans-Neptunian region, the instability occurs more frequently for SDOs with an initial orbital radius of 30 au than for those with an initial orbital radius of 50 au. Finally, we show that two SDOs with initial semi-major axes of 300 au and 1.5 au could have been members of a binary system through this process.",

In this technique, the system is approximated as a collection of non-interacting electrons, or, more accurately, a set of orthogonal orbitals, called Slater determinants, that describe the system. TheHartree-Fock equation, wherein the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals, is then iterated to self-consistency, that is, to a solution in which the orbitals do not change between iterations. Several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have since been developed. The coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert  3  and developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy  4 , is one such generalization. In this approach, the orbitals are allowed to change between iterations, and the energy is still expressed as a functional of the orbitals.

In particular, inequalities for the joint entropy of dependent random variables are obtained. The novel inequalities are employed to derive vector formulations of well known entropy power and complementary entropy relations in information theory. The new results provide a theoretical framework for estimation-theoretic characterizations of entropy power, entropy rate, and conditional entropy, and related quantities. The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics. Here is an excerpt from the paper: A remarkable property of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical mechanisms. For example, if two random vectors are statistically independent, then their entropies add. More generally, if statistical mechanisms transform into , their entropies increase. The entropy power inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) entropy power inequality are fundamental and well known results in information theory. The former states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the sum of the entropies of its components, while the latter states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the entropy of its mean. Both these inequalities hold for any random vectors. Here we present information-theoretic proofs of the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. Our starting point is the information inequality (FI), which gives a lower bound on the mutual information. Under suitable conditions, we obtain a new family of information inequalities, which imply the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. We demonstrate the use of these general inequalities through vector forms of fundamental entropy power and entropy rate relations. The inequalities presented here complement existing approaches to proving the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. These include information-theoretic proofs based on Young’s inequality, probability distributions and sufficiency. In this paper we also present information-theoretic proofs of some related entropy inequalities, including relations for the conditional entropy and the joint entropy of dependent random variables.

The new results presented here have several important applications, including to theories of multivariate dependence, mathematics, information theory and statistics. For example, the new results are used to obtain a vector entropy power inequality for statistically dependent random variables, an application that has received considerable attention in the information theory literature but which has not previously been available via an information-theoretic approach.

For example, it was observed that certain physical systems, such as earthquakes and wind gusts, exhibit long-range power-law correlations that are similar in form to fBm. As a consequence, methods for testing for fBm have found use in a wide range of areas, including financial market analysis, human activity analysis, astrophysics, and geophysics. On the other hand, there are many scenarios in which it is desired to test the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is either fBm or an alternative process. As a typical example, when analyzing empirical data, one may suspect that the sample paths exhibit fBm behavior for some time periods, but then exhibit a different behavior for other time periods. It is therefore of interest to have a statistical test for determining whether a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm or an alternative. Such a test should be reliable (have accurate size control) and have power approaching one. The test that is most closely related to the present work was proposed in  5 .

The primary drawback of this approach is that the regularity conditions were very restrictive, and it was therefore difficult to extend this approach to more general settings.

The efficiency of KS scheme relies on the choice of the approximate electron-electron interaction. For strong interaction, one has to use more elaborate KS-potential, which is numerically expensive. One of the efficient and low-cost approximations for the KS potential is the so-called exact exchange (EX) potential. This potential is constructed as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to the electron density. The density obtained from the KS equations with the EX potential as a part of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is very close to the actual one. However, the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS-potential yields a very large gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not correspond to the experimentally observed excitability of the systems. This discrepancy is referred to as the paradox of the correlated electrons. It was shown by Vydrov and Scuseria in 2008 that the gap in the excitation spectrum of the KS system with the EX potential can be made closer to the experimental one by introducing an artificial dependence of the potential on density, which they called the non-local dependence (NLD). In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term. The non-local term appears due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron density. We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into account. We present the KS equations with the new XC potential and prove that the solutions of the equations coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS potential. This solution eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the correlated electron systems described by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential.",

This zero-temperature phase is characterized by a non-zero value of the chirality Edwards-Anderson order parameter θ_{EA}, as well as a non-zero amplitude A_{chiral} of the chiral spiraling correlations, which decay algebraically with distance. Both θ_{EA} and A_{chiral} are computed via efficient genetic algorithms, embedded within the standard replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm. Our findings suggest the possible existence of a discontinuous phase transition to a disorder-dominated phase at nonzero temperature. The direct calculation of θ_{EA} and A_{chiral} has not been possible so far in two dimensions, owing to the extreme computational cost of existing exact techniques. Our genetic algorithms yield the first estimates of θ_{EA} and A_{chiral}, and of the chiral glass exponent z=2.21(4).

The XY spin glass is a classical, random spin model. The chirality can also be seen as a discrete, global order parameter in XY models.

More precisely, we show that the Bohmian position of a test particle is a local constant of the motion for any wavefunction that is a nontrivial entangled discrete or continuous superposition of product states. We give an explicit formula for this local de Broglie-Bohm wave in terms of the original wavefunction, and we apply our result to delocalized solutions of the one-dimensional quantum many-body dynamical Yang-Lee model, which includes the 1D Bose gas, the 1D hard-core gas, and the spin 1/2 XX model. We establish this result by first considering a discretized version of the original wavefunction, in which the original wavefunction is a nontrivial entangled superposition of product states. We then show that a similar result holds for the continuous limit of this discretized wavefunction. The proof proceeds by showing that the Bohmian position is a constant of the motion for any wavefunction that is a product state of the original wavefunction and its complex conjugate. We show that the real and imaginary parts of the continuous limit of the discretized wavefunction each have this property, and then prove the result by proving that the real and imaginary parts of the original wavefunction satisfy this property separately. We also show that the continuous limit of the discretized wavefunction converges to the original wavefunction in the limit of an infinitesimal wavepacket.

It is generally accepted that active galactic nucleis (AGN) are powered by material falling into a supermassive black hole at the center of the host galaxy. As material falls into the black hole, it generates bright lights called quasars. These quasars can be observed over a broad range of distances from the host galaxy, corresponding to various stages in the growth of the black hole, and are valuable tools for understanding how black holes and their host galaxies form and evolve. Using a large cluster catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 11, we select a sample of 43 quasars at a redshift of 0.3 < z < 2.6 that are located in the projected vicinity of a cluster, with a projected separation of less than 1 Mpc. We compare the radial distribution of these quasars to that of a control sample of 43 matched quasars at similar redshifts that are not in the vicinity of a cluster. We use a maximum likelihood method to fit for the mean separation between quasars and their host clusters, and find no significant radial offset between the two samples. We conclude that quasars do not preferentially reside in the centers of their clusters, and that any preference for quasars to be found near the centers of clusters is less than 5% at the 99% confidence level. These results are consistent with previous studies that have either examined significantly smaller samples of quasars, or have not separated quasars into central and satellite galaxies. Our results indicate that satellite quasars are not primarily being fueled by the hot gas in the clusters, but are instead forming their own massive reservoirs of cold gas, which are likely the primary source of fuel for future growth.

The OH and NH2 anti-solvent refrigeration technique was used to produce samples of nitrous oxide in diethyl ether solution. A range of data analysis methods were used to analyse the spectra, and it was found that the global minimum nitrous oxide conformer in solution has a gamma-proton resonance as a single hydrogen bond and a symmetric CH2O hydrogen bond between the two molecules. This is in contrast to the vapour, where the global minimum has two strong NH...O hydrogen bonds, leading to the resonance form. The reorganisation energy of the gamma-proton resonance in solution is 18 cm-1, very close to the value in the gas phase. The calculated am1g-frequencies for the two strongest NH...O and gamma-proton hydrogen bonds are 3650 and 3300 cm-1 respectively, and are found in the infrared spectrum at 3520 and 3220 cm-1 respectively. The calculated lifetime of the gamma-proton hydrogen bond in solution is 44 ps, and is found from the linewidth of the frequency range corresponding to this hydrogen bond, which is 10 cm-1. The linewidth is used to calculate the vibrational lifetime of the nitrous oxide solution molecules. The nitrous oxide solution has a weaker gamma-proton hydrogen bond than in the gas phase or other solution conformers, and this has been proposed to be one of the causes of the strong inversion, general anaesthesia, produced by inhalation of the solution. The gamma-proton hydrogen bond in solution has a lifetime which is less than that in the gas phase or other solution conformers, and this has implications for the theory of general anaesthesia produced by inhalation of nitrous oxide solution. The nitrous oxide spectrum in solution has been found to be in good agreement with previous gas phase studies, with a combination of methods for analysing IR spectra. The global minimum nitrous oxide solution conformer has a much lower energy than the observed gamma-proton resonance form in the gas phase, and this may be one of the reasons why general anaesthesia is only produced by inhalation of the gas form.

Historically, it was thought that these outflows were powered solely by energy lost by stretching of the GRB jet, which launches at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a viable model for the observed diversity of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During a GRB, the surface of the magnetar may emit gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, which could power a cosmological population of highly-relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds. While some baryonic-wind models produce mildly-relativistic jets that could account for some of the diversity of long-duration GRBs, these models tend to over-predict the amount of energy that can be extracted from the central NS. We demonstrate that a better coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows via neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux can solve this problem. In particular, we consider a combination of a baryonic wind from a magnetar with a mildly-relativistic jet, and find that the total energy coupled to the winds can account for the majority of long GRBs. We conclude that a model with a baryonic-wind component and a jet remains a viable model for the long-duration GRB phenomenon.

        "original_text": "Single point mutations (SPMs) in protein sequences have long been of interest to biologists and engineers, due to their capability to affect protein stability and function. Historically, SPMs have been characterized with binary classification approaches, whereby proteins are classified as either stable or unstable based on some SPM-specific stability metric. While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult. Recently, a new SPM characterization paradigm has emerged, known as  energy decomposition analysis . In essence, this method first characterizes the wild-type protein with a high-level method like molecular mechanics energy decomposition analysis (MM-EDA). For each SPM, the method then decomposes the total energy difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins into residue-level contributions. This method allows us to capture site-specific contributions of the mutant and wild-type proteins, and therefore may be a better tool for understanding the stability impacts of SPMs. We tested this paradigm on the recently published CO-BRASS data set (1). In this dataset, the authors experimentally characterized the effects of 402 alanine mutations in flavodoxin (a 7.3 kD protein). Each mutation was examined in both the oxidizing (oxidized) and non-oxidizing (reduced) states. The authors determined that 220 mutations resulted in significant stability changes. Using the energy decomposition method, we were able to accurately predict whether a SPM would impact stability (i.e. be positive or negative). As shown in Table 1, we were able to achieve 91% accuracy on the test set. Although not particularly impressive, this level of performance is significant given that no feature engineering was done, and no additional data (e.g. structural information) was utilized.

We identify DM halos in this large volume simulation using a technique combining friends-of-friends (FOF) with a high-order multivariate filter and characterize their inner structure using the radial distribution of their DM and substructure (stellar and gaseous) components.

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",

        "original_text": "A tool for computational cryptography known as Rime can establish security of communication over a channel by use of ideal lattices. A strong R-matrix is a non-linear operator that, together with a related linear operator (the S-matrix), yields an associative product that defines a finite-dimensional non-commutative ring with unity, known as a finite braided commutative algebra (FBCA). In this work we describe computation of R-matrices for eight binary QC codes using the RIME framework. We use the abelian setting where the S-matrix is a diagonal matrix to compute R-matrices that are also diagonal, and give examples of non-abelian R-matrices for the same codes. We discuss how the R-matrices interact with RIME to establish ideal lattices for each of the codes. The eight codes we study are optimal two-level codes, two-level extended Hamming codes, and five four-level codes commonly used in surface-code quantum computing. Our computed R-matrices have many nice properties, including compatibility with the abelian setting and simple structure when viewed as a lattice over the real numbers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. In particular, we describe the case where the R-matrix is a real diagonal matrix as a families of real numbers (depending on several parameters) where each number occurs with multiplicity one and each occurs exactly twice. We also show how to compute R-matrices corresponding to non-abelian structures when the S-matrix is diagonal. The RIME framework for computing R-matrices in the abelian setting makes use of an appropriately modified quantum chess problem, the Hamilton Pfaffian QC-polynomial. In particular, each symmetry of the chess problem corresponds to a permutation matrix in the R-matrix, and these permutations satisfy a precise lattice-theoretical restriction. In the non-abelian case, no analogous check for R-matrix structure appears to be known, so alternative techniques must be used to establish non-abelian R-matrices. In this work, we describe a non-abelian RIME framework that similarly uses a modified Hamilton Pfaffian but with the permutations no longer required to satisfy a lattice-theoretical restriction. Instead, an ad-hoc method for establishing non-abelianity is used. Finally, we present a few experiments using RIME to establish security of communication over common communication channels (such as WiFi or cell-phone networks). We show that our computed R-matrices are strong and that ideal lattices produced using the R-matrices are the best lattice-based schemes we can find for each of the codes we study.

Here we introduce a fermion lattice model that incorporates strong electronic correlations without explicit treatment of the local cobalt orbitals.

Although originally classified as a single-lined spectroscopic binary (which is usually taken to indicate a planetary system), UScoJ1609-2156 actually consists of at least three components, two of which are currently visible with the naked eye. Both USco1609A and B are M-dwarf components in a close hierarchical orbit, with periods of ~1 day and an apsidal alignment such that their combined transit duration is ~6 hours.

        "original_text": "Massive galaxies at high redshift (z ~ 2) are thought to build up the massive galaxies observed in the local universe1, 2. In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",
