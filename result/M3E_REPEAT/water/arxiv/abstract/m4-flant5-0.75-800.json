We find that the CCE is strongly suppressed by the presence of the substrate and vanishes completely when the distance to it becomes smaller than about one molecular diameter. The results are compared with those obtained within the mean-field approximation which overestimates the magnitude of the effect considerably. In addition we show how the influence of the substrate can be taken into account in an approximate way. \nPACS numbers: 67.85.-j, 68.45.-k, 71.10.Fd \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe critical Casimir effect  1  , i.e., the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions, has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically  2  -  4  and experimentally  5  . It was shown  6  that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation  7, 8  or wetting  9  .\nIn particular, the critical Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films  10  where it leads to the appearance of additional forces  11  responsible for the formation of stable droplets  12  . These effects have been observed recently  13  in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps  14  . However, most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate  15  -  17  .

Instead, one must use indirect methods such as reverberation mapping or statistical correlations between various properties of AGNs to determine their luminosities. For example, if one knows how much light passes through some region of interest within an AGN then one may calculate its luminosity using simple geometric arguments. Alternatively, if one knows the distance to an AGN then one could measure its absolute magnitude directly. Unfortunately, both of these approaches require detailed knowledge about the structure of the emitting regions which cannot currently be obtained observationally.

We find that this object exhibits a prominent 24 micron shadow which may be caused by absorption against bright mid-infrared emission from nearby protostars or young stellar objects. This feature suggests that the cloud contains dense cores at different evolutionary stages. Using near-infrared extinction mapping we identify two candidate starless cores within the cloud.

The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process.

        "original_text": "In this work, we consider the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) for code division multiple access systems with time-varying channels. We propose an algorithm that jointly performs user identification and data detection by using a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which iteratively estimates both the channel coefficients and transmitted symbols. In order to reduce computational complexity, we also develop a low-complexity suboptimal MUD scheme. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing schemes under various scenarios. Index Terms-Data detection, EM algorithm, Multiuser detection, Time varying channels. 1 Introduction Code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) has been widely used as one of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless communications due to its high spectral efficiency  1  . However, CDMA suffers from severe interference between users caused by multipath propagation  2  , especially when the number of active users increases  3  .\nTo mitigate inter-user interference, multiuser detectors have been developed  4  -  6  . Among them, linear multiuser detectors are attractive because they can be implemented easily at low cost  7  . Unfortunately, these detectors suffer from performance loss compared to optimal multiuser detectors  8  . To improve their performance, nonlinear multiuser detectors such as successive interference cancellation  9  or parallel interference cancellation  10  were introduced.

In addition to this dependence on orbital geometry, our models suggest that TDGs are more likely to be formed if the progenitor galaxies have high gas fractions and/or low central surface brightnesses. Finally, we argue that TDGs may provide useful probes for testing theories of gravity on galactic scales.

These physical characteristics determine many observable quantities such as luminosity, colours, morphology, kinematics, etc., which have been studied extensively over several decades. However, it has become clear recently that there exist significant degeneracies between some of these observables and therefore they cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the underlying physics or geometry of the system. For example, the total luminosity of a galaxy depends not only on its current star formation rate but also on its past star formation activity through the integrated light of old stars. Similarly, the colour of a galaxy depends both on its metallicity and on the amount of dust extinction along our line-of-sight. Therefore, accurate measurements of all relevant physical parameters require detailed spectroscopic observations covering large wavelength ranges.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio. Finally, we discuss how the inclusion of kinetic effects affects the scaling laws characterizing the power spectra of the fluctuating fields. \n3.

In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well.

The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years  1, 2  .

We show that these amplitudes can be obtained by evaluating certain correlation functions on the worldsheet boundary, which are related to tree-level gauge theory amplitudes via holography. The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states. These arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincare transformations; they correspond to corrections to the supergravity action induced by higher derivative terms in the bulk effective field theory. \nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence  1  relates type IIB superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) to conformal field theories living on its four-dimensional boundary.

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today.

Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase.

Our main conclusions are summarized below: \n \n \n \n 1. Ages - We find that most of the clusters analyzed here appear younger than previously thought based upon their location relative to the fiducial ridge line defined by the Milky Way s old open clusters. This result suggests that either the age scale derived using open clusters may be systematically too young or that there has been significant dynamical evolution within many of the clusters since they formed. \n \n 2. Reddening - We find evidence for differential reddening across several of the clusters studied here. However, it appears that the majority of the clusters do not suffer from large amounts of differential reddening. For those clusters where we can measure individual reddenings for different populations of stars, we find no systematic differences between the values determined for blue stragglers versus normal giants. These results suggest that any differential reddening affecting these clusters must occur over scales smaller than the typical size of an open cluster. \n \n 3.

We find that the junction conductance depends strongly on the tilt angle between the molecule backbone and the substrate normal. This is explained by an anisotropic coupling strength between the molecule and the metal contacts which leads to different transmission probabilities along the two main axes of the molecule.

Finally we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn accurate models for several challenging sequence labeling tasks including part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing and protein secondary structure prediction in bioinformatics.

This enables us to efficiently compute the partition function required by standard CRFs with dynamic programming techniques.

We show that these flows are governed by an exact functional differential equation which is derived using the background field method. The solution to this equation yields all possible counterterms needed to render the theory finite at any order in perturbation theory. This result generalizes previous results obtained within the context of flat space-time. In particular we find that the beta functions for the gravitational couplings do not vanish even if one considers only pure Yang-Mills theories without matter fields.

It is well known that this property arises due to destructive interference between different pathways leading to emission of photons  4  .\nRecently, several authors studied the effects of spontaneous emission on the second-order correlation functions  5  -  8  . They showed that the presence of spontaneous emission leads to sub-Poissonian statistics  6 - 8  . However, these studies were restricted only to the case where the atom interacts with a single mode of field. On the other hand, many experiments involving atoms interacting simultaneously with multiple modes of electromagnetic field have also been performed  9  -  11  . For example, in Ref.  10  , the authors investigated the influence of vacuum fluctuations on the fluorescence spectrum of a three-level system driven by two laser beams. In addition, they found that the intensity noise of the emitted light depends strongly on the relative phase difference between the driving lasers.

        "original_text": "We study the dynamics of open quantum systems in one dimension, focusing on their ability to generate entanglement between distant sites and how this is affected by decoherence.  We consider two different models for the system-environment interaction: (i) an environment that couples locally with each site; and (ii) an environment that couples globally with all sites simultaneously. In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales.

The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes.

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone.

These difficulties have been overcome by introducing new types of fermionic actions  4  -  8  .\nThe most popular one among them is probably the overlap-Dirac operator  9  , whose eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation  10  . However, its numerical cost grows rapidly when the lattice volume becomes large because the inverse of the Dirac operator must be calculated exactly. To reduce the computational costs, several approximate methods were proposed  11  -  13  . Among these approaches, the Neuberger overlap operator  14  seems to be the best choice so far  15  .\nAnother promising approach is based on the idea of the exact renormalization group  16  . It was shown  17  that the fermion determinant detD(μ), where D(μ) denotes the fermion matrix defined through the fermion action Sf  U  ≡ ∑x Tr γμD(μ)Ux , satisfies the following flow equation:",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK In rebuilding backyard , it was found that the standard Wilson - type fermions suffer from severe fox such as the so - fighter species doubling problem 1 , the Nielsen - Ninomiya theorem 2 , and the Gribov confiscated problem 3 . These fox have been overcome by introducing backyard types of fermionic recovered 4 - 8 . The most fox fox among them is probably the overlap - Dirac operator 9 , whose eigenfunctions satisfy the Ginsparg - Wilson relation 10 . However , its Ducks cost grows rapidly when the lattice volume becomes large because the inverse of the Dirac operator shake be calculated exactly . To reduce the Santos costs , several approximate backyard were proposed 11 - 13 . Among these approaches , the Neuberger overlap operator 14 seems to be the Tourism choice so far 15 . Another promising approach is based on the idea of the exact renormalization exploring 16 . It was shown 17 that the fermion determinant detD ( μ ) , where D ( μ ) tenth the fermion matrix defined through the fermion fox Sf U ≡ [UNK] Tr γμD ( μ ) Ux , satisfies the following flow equation :",

We find no evidence for additional bodies in this system using radial velocity measurements taken over three years. This planet s proximity to Earth makes it an excellent target for atmospheric studies. \n \n Keywords: Extrasolar planet - Discovery - Transit photometry - Radial velocities - Atmosphere - Planetary systems \n \n \n \n Introduction \n \n In recent years there have been several discoveries of giant exoplanets with orbital periods shorter than four days. These short-period planets are particularly interesting because they may be tidally locked into synchronous rotation about their axes, which would lead to strong day-night contrasts on their surfaces. Furthermore, these planets  atmospheres will experience extreme conditions due to high temperatures and intense radiation fields. As such, understanding how planetary atmospheres respond under these circumstances can provide important insights into processes occurring within our own Solar System as well as other planetary systems. \n \n Here we present the discovery and initial characterization of TrES-3b; a hot Jupiter with a period P = 3.09 d discovered by the transit method.

In addition, it was found that the growth rate of firm size follows Gibrat s Law while that of profitability does not. This suggests that the relationship between firm size and profitability may be explained by the fact that they have different underlying processes.

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields.

One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

Maser sources are usually associated with star forming regions where water vapor molecules form into microscopic crystals known as ice grains. When the ice grains grow larger than about one micron, they become unstable against gravitational collapse and begin emitting intense radiation.

We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game between users competing for limited power resources under their individual delay constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to Nash equilibrium points that are Pareto optimal solutions to the formulated optimization problems. Numerical results show that our approach can significantly improve system performance compared to existing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher data rates while maintaining low outage probabilities at different signal-to-noise ratios. \n \n Keywords: Code Division Multiple Access, Noncooperative Games, Power Allocation, Energy Efficiency, Multiuser Diversity, Delay Constraint. 1 Introduction \n \n With the rapid growth of wireless communication systems such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, there has been increasing interest in developing efficient resource allocation algorithms to maximize network capacity or minimize total transmit power consumption  1  .

The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts.

        "original_text": "The Coulomb drag effect is the phenomenon where one charge carrier can transfer energy to another by exchanging virtual phonons, leading to an electric current in the second carrier that opposes its own motion.  In this work we study the Coulomb drag between two graphene sheets separated by a dielectric spacer layer and subject to different gate voltages. We find that for small separation distances (less than 10 nm) there are significant deviations from the predictions based on the standard theory developed for bulk materials. These deviations arise due to the presence of evanescent modes which couple strongly with the carriers at low energies. For larger separations these effects become negligible as expected. The results presented here provide useful information about how to design devices such as transistors or thermoelectric generators using graphene layers. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nGraphene has attracted considerable attention recently because it exhibits unique electronic properties  1  . It consists of carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice structure and behaves like a two-dimensional electron gas when doped  2  .\nOne interesting property of graphene is the so-called Coulomb drag effect  3  , i.e., the generation of an electric current in a second sheet of electrons moving through a first sheet of electrons even if they do not interact directly  4  .

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening. In particular we find that for small values of the QD size dispersion there exists a critical value of the growth rate above which ordered QD arrays cannot be formed. This result explains why it has been so difficult to grow ordered QD arrays with large QD sizes using conventional techniques. \n \n Keywords: Ordering, Strain Relaxation, Surface Diffusion, Quantum Dot Arrays, Stability, Growth Rate, Molecular Beam Epitaxy \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs), also known as colloidal quantum dots, have attracted considerable attention due to their unique optical properties  1  .

We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades  1, 2  .

        "original_text": "We study gravitational waves produced by curvaton scenario, where the inflaton field is coupled to another scalar field called curvaton which decays into radiation after inflation and produces primordial density fluctuations. We find that the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation can be enhanced if the decay rate of curvaton is large enough compared with Hubble parameter at its decay time. In this case we show that the tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes larger than 0.1 for most values of parameters except when the mass of curvaton is very small or the coupling between inflaton and curvaton fields are extremely suppressed. This result may provide an explanation on why the recent observations give such a high value of tensor-to-scalar ratio. \n \n Introduction \n \n The current observational data  1  strongly suggest that there exists a significant amount of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) in our universe. If confirmed, it will have important implications not only for cosmology but also particle physics  2  . However, the origin of these GWs has been one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology  3  .\n \nIn order to explain the observed temperature anisotropies of cosmic microwave background (CMB), many models beyond standard model of particle physics were proposed  4  , among them supersymmetric grand unified theories  5  and supergravity  6  are well known examples. These models predict new particles whose masses lie around 10 16 GeV  7, 8  . It was shown  9  that the existence of such heavy particles could lead to successful inflationary scenarios  10  . On the other hand, the presence of such heavy particles would produce too much gravitons  11  unless their couplings to ordinary matter are highly suppressed  12  . Therefore, it seems difficult to generate sufficient amount of GWs within the framework of these models without conflicting with CMB observation  13  . \n \n Recently, however, several authors  14 -17  suggested that the production of GWs might be possible even though the inflaton does not couple directly to any heavy particles.
