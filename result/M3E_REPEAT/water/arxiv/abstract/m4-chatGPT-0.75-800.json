The infrared excess emission detected around this object suggests it may have a circumstellar disk similar to those found around young stars such as T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be stars.

These data show significant variations in both the near-infrared fluxes and colours of the central source consistent with changes in the amount of dust surrounding the star.  This behaviour is very similar to what is seen in other pre-main-sequence systems where accretion onto the central star causes periodic increases in luminosity accompanied by increased levels of reddening due to heating of the surrounding dust grains.   Our results suggest that the current level of activity in the system is relatively low compared to previous epochs but we cannot rule out the possibility that the recent increase in brightness was caused by a short-lived burst of enhanced accretion rather than steady-state accretion occurring throughout our observing campaign.",

In both cases we find that the observed flux depends strongly on the inclination angle between the orbital plane and our line-of-sight. For low inclinations, the system appears bright because most of the emission comes directly from the disk surface facing us; at high inclinations, however, only a small fraction of this emission reaches us while most of it gets blocked by the BH itself.

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

        "original_text": "We report on the observation of electron doping in cuprate superconductors by interfacing them to manganite insulators through epitaxial growth and chemical bonding at interfaces.  The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures.

We show that this system is equivalent to a collection of independent random walks evolving in parallel and interacting via pairwise collisions at vertices. The collision rate depends only on the number of particles present at each vertex; it vanishes for graphs without loops or multiple edges (e.g., trees), but can be arbitrarily large otherwise. This model exhibits interesting behavior even when all rates are equal, including anomalous diffusion and superdiffusion.

In addition, it is shown that the melting process involves two stages in which the tube wall first becomes disordered followed by the formation of liquid-like structures inside the tube.

Among them, the possibility of creating stable spin textures  3  , topological defects  4  , and vortex lattices  5  has attracted considerable attention over the past few years  6  .\nIn this work we focus on another interesting class of solutions recently predicted theoretically  7, 8  : Bright-Dark Soliton Complex (BDSC) pairs. These consist of a pair of spatially separated bright and dark solitons whose relative phase varies continuously across the system  9  .

These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

We find that for small separation distances (less than 10 nm) there are significant deviations from the predictions based on the standard theory developed for bulk materials. These deviations arise due to the presence of evanescent modes which couple strongly with the carriers at low energies. For larger separations these effects become negligible as expected.

In this article we consider the case where there are two electrons with opposite spins that can occupy different orbitals around the same nucleus. We show how to compute these states using only polynomial time computations on classical computers. This result was obtained by applying some techniques developed recently in computational complexity theory such as the PCP theorem (the probabilistic checkable proof) and the local testability of CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems). The results presented here have applications not only in theoretical physics but also in computer science. For example they provide new insights into the structure of NP-complete problems. Quantum mechanical systems play an essential role in modern physics. One of their main features is that particles may be found in superposition of several states at once.

        "original_text": "We study the Laplacian spectrum of complex networks, focusing in particular on its relation to the dynamics of random walks on them. We show that for any network with n nodes there are at most 2n eigenvalues different from zero (counting multiplicities). This bound is tight up to a constant factor when applied to trees or complete graphs. For general graphs we prove an upper bound of O(n log n) on the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues. In addition, we provide lower bounds showing that this estimate cannot be improved by more than a polylogarithmic factor.

This finding suggests that the EPI in doped graphene may be tunable over several orders of magnitude through chemical or electrostatic gating. \n \n Graphene has attracted considerable attention because it exhibits unique physical properties such as extremely high carrier mobility1-5 and very large optical nonlinearities6-8.

In this work we demonstrate that the EPI in heavily boron-doping epitaxial graphene grown by thermal decomposition of SiC18-20 can be significantly enhanced due to the presence of a Dirac point21-23 and its associated van Hov singularity24-26 near the Fermi energy EF.

Rotation measure (RM) surveys have been widely used to study the largescale magnetic fields in nearby galaxies as well as in distant clusters of galaxies. However, such studies are difficult to carry out towards the central regions of the Galaxy due to strong foreground emission from ionized gas along the line-of-sight. In this work we report a survey of the large-scale magnetic field in front of the Galactic Center using rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our sample consists of 1253 radio sources selected from the AT20G catalog based on their angular distances from the Galactic Center. Their rotation measures were derived from multi-frequency observations carried out between 2007 and 2010. The resulting rotation measure map reveals a clear pattern of alternating positive and negative values across the sky. By fitting these data points with a simple axisymmetric model, we obtain a best-fit value of B = 3 μG for the mean magnetic field strength inside a radius of 2 kpc centered on the Galactic Center. Beyond this region, the magnetic field strength drops quickly to less than 1 μG. Furthermore, there appears to exist a systematic deviation from axial symmetry around the GC.",

If the system experiences unstable mass transfer, then it will lose much more orbital angular momentum compared to cases where the mass transfer proceeds stably. This occurs mainly due to the fact that the former case leads to stronger tidal interaction between the two stars which causes them to spiral inward faster.",

We show that this dichotomy is consistent with theoretical predictions for the evolution of CVs driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation. The observed distribution of orbital periods can also be explained if there exists a minimum period below which no CVs exist due to magnetic braking. This result has important implications on our understanding of how CVs evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), interacting binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting matter from its low-mass companion through Roche lobe overflow, are among the best studied classes of close binary stars.

The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today.

Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 .

One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",

We show that reverberation can be generated by the interplay between calcium signaling and short-term plasticity (STP) at excitatory synapses. In our model, STP leads to bursts of spikes which are followed by periods of low firing rate due to depletion of neurotransmitter vesicles. The resulting slow recovery of transmitter release causes a build-up of residual calcium concentration  Ca  res , leading to facilitation of glutamate release during subsequent bursts.

INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest on higher derivative theories of gravity motivated mainly by their possible role in quantum gravity phenomenology (see e.g. ), but also because they provide interesting alternatives to standard General Relativity (GR) in the context of modified gravity scenarios . However, despite these efforts, our understanding of the physical consequences of these theories remains incomplete due to technical difficulties associated with the analysis of their solutions. One of the main obstacles comes from the fact that the equations of motion derived from these actions contain derivatives of arbitrarily high order, making them difficult or impossible to solve analytically. A way out of this problem consists in expanding the fields around some fixed background solution and truncating the resulting series expansion after a finite number of terms. Although this approach allows one to obtain useful information about the dynamics of the system under consideration, it fails to capture important features like back-reaction effects between different modes of the same field or interactions among different fields. For example, in the case of inflationary cosmologies based on higher derivative gravity, the truncated perturbative expansions do not reproduce correctly the observed level of primordial non-Gaussianities .\nA more systematic method to deal with these problems involves the use of covariant techniques developed originally within the framework of GR.

        "original_text": "We study the gravitational field generated by a massive scalar point source moving on an equatorial circular geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole, and we evolve it numerically in two spatial dimensions (2+1) with the puncture method. We find that the perturbation is dominated by a single mode which grows exponentially as time goes on. The growth rate agrees well with the prediction based on quasinormal modes for this system. This result suggests that the exponential growth may be related to the instability of the scalar field near the horizon. In addition, we also show that the amplitude of the growing mode decreases rapidly when the mass of the scalar field increases. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. \n \n Introduction \n \n Black holes are among the most fascinating objects predicted by general relativity. They have been studied extensively both theoretically and observationally over many decades  1  . One important aspect of their physics concerns how particles move close to them  2  , especially those that can escape from the black hole s gravity  3  . It has recently become clear that there exist some interesting physical processes taking place very close to the event horizon  4  -  6  . For example, if one considers a charged particle falling into a Reissner-Nordström black hole, then its motion will be unstable due to the so-called  photon sphere effect   7, 8  . If the charge of the particle is sufficiently large, then the particle will eventually fall into the black hole after emitting photons  9  . Another interesting phenomenon occurs when a neutral particle falls into a Kerr black hole  10  . Here again, the motion becomes unstable because of the existence of the photon sphere  11  .

We find that the night-side temperature is strongly dependent on opacity, which determines how much energy can be transported to space by radiation. The day-night contrast increases as we decrease the opacity because less heat escapes through the nightside atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower pressures where convection becomes inefficient. For low enough opacities, the planet cools down completely during its orbit resulting in an extremely cold night side. Our simulations show that EGPs are likely to have very different climates depending on their composition.

Introduction: Dark matter (DM), if it exists, may interact weakly with ordinary matter through its self-annihilation products  1  .

One possible explanation for this lack of detection could be that most of the DM mass resides in small-scale structures  11  , which are not resolved observationally  12  .

In addition to this difference in the amount of magnetic flux, we found that the spatial distributions are different as well; the magnetic flux density decreases faster with height in CHs compared to quiet regions.

This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases.

Keywords: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars; Dust formation; Red Giants; Mass loss. 1 Introduction Carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter Crich AGB) stars have been studied extensively over the past decades because they represent an important source class of interstellar matter. They lose large amounts of material through stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the outflowing gas. These winds play an essential role in shaping circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars and thus influence the appearance of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. However, despite numerous observational studies it remains unclear what determines the amount of mass lost by Crich AGB stars. It has been suggested that the total luminosity L * , the effective temperature T eff , the surface gravity g, the metallicity Z, the pulsation period P, and the initial mass M ini might all affectṀ . For example, Wood et al. (1992) , van Loon et al. (1999), Olofsson et al. (2002a) , Knapp & Morris (1985) , and Winters et al.

This allows us to obtain results for the beta function of the dilaton coupling to the Ricci scalar which are consistent with those obtained by other methods but have not been previously available due to technical difficulties.

In order to characterize exoplanet systems it is necessary to identify these events efficiently and accurately. However, this task has been made more difficult due to the large number of false positives produced by systematic noise sources such as instrumental artifacts and astrophysical phenomena like eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. \n \n To date there have been several methods developed specifically for identifying transit-like features within astronomical time series data.

In particular we show that the inclusion of these effects leads to a significant reduction of the predicted nuclear modification factor RAA(pT ) compared to previous calculations based on purely elastic interactions. \nPACS numbers: 12.38.Mh, 25.75.-q, 11.10.Kk \nI. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K\nThe measurement of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium (Υ) production is one of the most promising probes to investigate properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions  1  . It has been suggested that the interaction between the produced quarkonia and the surrounding medium may lead to their partial melting  2  , i.e., to a decrease of the bound state masses due to color screening  3  .\nIn this work we present results obtained within an effective field theory framework  4  , where the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons rather than individual hadronic states. This allows us to calculate the total cross section for quarkonium production in terms of elementary partonic subprocesses involving light quarks q = u, d, s and gluons g. These include elastic scattering off quarks and gluon-gluon fusion leading to the formation of quarkonia via the creation of a virtual qq pair  5  . Furthermore, inelastic processes such as quarkonium dissociation into open heavy-flavor hadrons  6  have also been included  7, 8  .",

We show how this approach can be used to fit observational data such as those obtained from kinematic tracers or gravitational lensing measurements. In particular we apply our method to two different sets of observations: 1) A sample of RR Lyrae stars observed towards the Galactic bulge; 2) Gravitational lensing measurements towards the Bullet Cluster. Our results are compared against previous works using similar techniques but assuming either constant anisotropies across all radii or simple power-law radial dependences. We find that these assumptions lead to significant biases when fitting the data.",

We have studied the correlation between the total power of the diffuse radio emission and other physical parameters such as X-ray luminosity, temperature and mass for a sample of 25 galaxy clusters observed by GMRT. The main result is that we find evidence for two different populations of radio halo sources which are separated by their radio powers. In particular, our analysis shows that there exists an upper limit to the radio power of radio halos hosted by massive galaxy clusters. This suggests that the energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the synchrotron emission decreases rapidly beyond this threshold value. Our findings also suggest that the magnetic field strength increases with increasing radio power. These results can be explained within the framework of the re-acceleration model where secondary electrons produced through hadronic interactions are reaccelerated by turbulence generated during mergers or accretion events.",
