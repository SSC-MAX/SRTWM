We consider a model where the gravitational field is quantized using LQG techniques while matter fields are treated classically.

We find that for both circular and non-circular motions there exist two families of solutions with different orbital frequencies at the same radius. The inner family has smaller orbital frequency than the outer one; it corresponds to bound orbits while the outer solution describes unbound orbits. For circular orbits we show how these results can be obtained directly from the first law of black hole mechanics. In addition, we also present numerical evidence showing that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) moves inward as the spin parameter increases. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results on astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks around spinning black holes. Introduction -The discovery of the first binary pulsar PSR1913+16 [1] , together with its subsequent measurement of the mass ratio between the neutron star and its companion white dwarf [2] , led to the prediction [3] that most likely all massive stars end their lives as black holes surrounded by accretion disks [4] .

This information is encoded in the location of the so-called Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), i.e., the smallest possible radius r ISCO of a particle's circular orbit [7, 8] .

The potential landscape is engineered to have two different types of local minima separated by barriers with varying heights and widths. We show that this design allows for controlling both directional transport as well as its speed over several orders of magnitude. This work opens up new possibilities for designing active materials with tunable properties. A growing number of applications require systems capable of converting energy into directed motion at low Reynolds numbers [1] . In recent years, there has been significant progress towards realizing such devices known as \"Brownian motors\" [2] , which are typically composed of many interacting particles moving through complex environments [3] .\nIn particular, it was shown theoretically [4] and experimentally [5] that one can create a unidirectional current of colloids using optical traps arranged in a 2D square or honeycomb pattern [6] . However, these designs cannot be easily extended to three dimensions (3D) due to technical limitations associated with creating stable trapping sites [7, 8] . Here we demonstrate how to overcome those challenges by engineering the shape of the potential wells and barriers in order to achieve robust 3D transport.

We argue that there are at least two distinct ways to understand what it means for one problem to be reduced to another by an algorithm; these correspond roughly to the notions of polynomial-time reductions and Turing reductions respectively. The former is more commonly used than the latter, but we show how both can be understood in terms of each other using the notion of relativised polynomial time. In particular, we prove that every problem which is not NP-complete under Turing reductions must have some property which makes it easy to solve relative to any oracle set containing all NP sets.

Algorithmic reductions play a central role in computational complexity theory, providing a way of relating seemingly disparate classes of decision problems such as those belonging to the class NP (the non-deterministic polynomial time computable problems) with those belonging to the class co-NP (the complements of NP problems).

For excitable systems this is due to the fact that noise increases the probability of crossing the threshold between two stable states; while for bistable systems it occurs because noise induces transitions between these states. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous studies based on other approaches. Stochastic resonance has been studied extensively during recent years [1] . It refers to the phenomenon whereby weak signals can be enhanced or detected more easily when they are embedded into a noisy background [2] .\nIn many physical situations, however, one needs to consider not only the effect of external noise sources but also internal fluctuations arising from the dynamics itself [3] . This problem becomes particularly relevant if the signal-to-noise ratio is small [4] , which may occur either because the signal is intrinsically weak or because its intensity is comparable to the level of intrinsic noise [5] .

However, processing massive amounts of streaming data poses several challenges since traditional batch-based approaches are not applicable anymore [25] . For example, if one wants to detect anomalies in a continuous flow of tweets, he needs to continuously monitor all incoming messages and identify those which deviate significantly from normal behavior [26] .\nTo address these issues, researchers have developed various techniques for analyzing data streams [7, 8, 27 ]. An emerging area within data stream mining focuses on discovering interesting patterns from data streams [28] . A common task in this context is finding frequent items/patterns in data streams [29] .

The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of shadowing trajectories which are close approximations of unstable periodic orbits embedded within the attractor. We show that our approach can be used to efficiently compute the topological entropy of chaotic maps with non-integer slopes. Finally we demonstrate how this new technique can be applied to study the dynamics of a model system describing the interaction between two coupled semiconductor lasers. Periodic orbits play an important role in understanding the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular they provide valuable information about the underlying structure of the attractors associated with these systems. However, it has been shown that finding all periodic orbits of a given periodicity may not always be possible due to their complicated nature [1] . This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with chaotic systems where the number of periodic orbits increases exponentially with increasing period [2] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to develop techniques to find periodic orbits numerically [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , but most of them suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: (i) They require very high computational resources. (ii) They do not guarantee convergence towards the desired orbit. Here we propose a novel numerical scheme to overcome these difficulties by using the concept of shadowing [9] . Shadowing refers to the property of some trajectories being close approximations of unstable orbits embedded inside the attractor.

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect.

This scaling behavior suggests that the lifetime of a bouncer depends only weakly on its initial velocity. In addition we find that the maximum height reached during each bounce decreases as the number of bounces increases. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be used to estimate the surface tension of water based on experimental data. Bouncing droplets have been studied extensively over recent years due to their potential applications in microfluidics [1] .

We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well. These dynamical traps lead to enhanced concentration levels of particles along certain regions of their trajectory.

Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule's orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years [1, 2] . It provides access to extreme ultraviolet radiation [3] , which enables novel applications such as attosecond pulse generation [4] , photoelectron spectroscopy [5] , and tomography [6] .\nThe underlying physical mechanism behind HHG was first explained within the semiclassical three-step model [7, 8] : An electron tunnels out of its atomic core into the continuum upon interaction with the electric field of the laser light. Afterwards it propagates freely before being driven back towards the nucleus by the same field. Finally, it recombines with the parent ion emitting a photon whose energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy gained during propagation and the binding energy lost due to tunneling [9] .

Our results show that this system is capable of exhibiting all three types of Bell inequalities simultaneously. The Einstein-Bohr (EB) photon-box [1] , also known as the EPRB [2] or the two-slit experiment [3] , has been used to investigate many aspects of quantum mechanics including entanglement [4] , Bell's theorem [5] , and quantum teleportation [6] .

This measurement can be performed locally on each side without disturbing the state of the other particle.

Our sample contains two HVSs with velocities greater than 1000 km/s; one has a heliocentric radial velocity of 1240 km/s and another has 1420 km/s.

This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",

In addition, we show how our results are related to existing work on this topic. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our approach over other schemes. Wireless broadcast has been studied extensively for many years due to its wide range of applications such as data dissemination, file transfer, video streaming, etc.. However, most previous works assume that all transmissions occur synchronously or within some fixed schedule. This assumption does not hold true when there exist multiple transmitters competing for channel resources simultaneously. Random access (RA) protocols have recently received much attention because they allow users to send packets whenever it is convenient without requiring tight synchronization among them [1] . Unfortunately, RA introduces additional challenges compared to traditional synchronous transmission models since collisions may happen frequently if no coordination exists between different transmitters [2] .\nIn this paper, we study the problem of broadcasting in multi-hop wireless networks with random access. Specifically, each node maintains one packet which needs to be transmitted to every other node in the network eventually. Each node chooses independently and uniformly at random a starting time slot to begin transmitting its packet. If two or more nodes start their transmissions at the same time slot, then these transmissions collide and none of them will reach the intended receivers successfully.

In recent years there has been renewed interest in studying this model because of its potential application in quantum information processing [2] , quantum optics [3] , condensed matter physics [4] , etc.. For example, the collective spontaneous emission rate of the atomic ensemble depends on the total angular momentum J = N /2 (N being the number of atoms) [5] .\nIn fact, the Dicke model was originally proposed more than half century ago [6] . Since then various theoretical approaches have been developed to solve it [7 -10] . Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation [11] which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system [12] . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states [13] . Recently, several authors [14 -19] have tried to overcome this difficulty by introducing new transformations or approximations.

We find that this CME originated from a complex magnetic structure consisting of two opposite-polarity flux systems connected by a filament channel. In addition, we found that there were several small-scale brightenings around the main sunspots before the onset of the flare/CME activity. These brightenings are identified as ephemeral regions (ERs), which are known to play important roles for triggering eruptions such as flares or CMEs. By analyzing high-resolution images taken by Hinode/SOT/SP, we show that one of these ERs interacted strongly with the surrounding magnetic field lines during its rapid rotation.

We show that these actions are not generally invariant under local gauge transformations unless certain conditions on their form are satisfied. These results have important consequences for the construction of gauge-invariant observables in supersymmetric gauge theories. They also provide an explanation why it is possible to construct nontrivial superpotentials even though supersymmetry does not allow any explicit breaking terms at tree level. Finally we argue that our findings can be used to resolve some puzzling features observed recently in lattice simulations of N = 1 supersymmetric QCD with four flavors. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories play an important role both in particle physics and string theory. Their low-energy dynamics is described by an effective action which contains all quantum corrections due to the integration over heavy fields like quarks or gluons. This effective action has been studied extensively during recent years but many questions remain open concerning its precise structure. One particular issue concerns the question whether this action is gauge invariant. It was shown already more than twenty years ago [1] that if one integrates out only massive fermions then the resulting effective action is indeed gauge invariant. However, when including also massive bosonic degrees of freedom there exist counterexamples where the effective action fails to be gauge invariant [2] . Recently, this problem attracted renewed interest because of its relevance for the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories [3, 4] .\nIn this work we study the gauge invariance properties systematically using functional methods. Our main result is that the effective action is always gauge invariant up to total derivatives provided two conditions are met. First, the effective action must contain no higher-order time-derivatives acting on the gauge field. Second, the coefficients appearing in front of the various operators in the effective action should satisfy certain relations.

The proof relies on a combination of techniques from nonlinear analysis (Lyapunov functions) and kinetic theory (Boltzmann equation). In this work we study the dynamics of an adiabatic gas-piston system consisting of one-dimensional ideal gases confined between two walls. One of these walls is fixed while the other moves periodically according to some prescribed law. This problem has been studied extensively since the pioneering works of Maxwell [Max] , Boltzmann [Bol1] , and Sackur-Tetrode [Sac] .

We show that RSP is strongly affected by the presence of the Luttinger parameter, which describes the strength of electron-electron interactions. In particular we find that for large values of the Luttinger parameters the magnitude of RSP decreases significantly due to an increase in the effective mass of holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RSP can be controlled by applying external electric fields perpendicular to the plane of the 2D hole gas. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments on GaAs quantum wells. The effect of the Luttinger terms, structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), and Zeeman splitting on resonant spin polarization (RS P ) has been studied using density functional theory. It was found that RS P is suppressed when the Luttinger parameter increases because it leads to larger effective masses. Moreover, it was shown that RS P can be tuned by applying external electric fields normal to the plane of the two-dimensional hole gas.

The proposed method is based on the idea of using multiple views, each one capturing different aspects or features of the same dataset. We show how this can be achieved by defining a set of views for each node in the decision tree model being learned. These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent's training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL).

One of the most interesting examples is provided by layered quantum antiferromagnets [4] . These compounds consist of weakly coupled planes of spins arranged into a regular lattice structure. Due to strong geometrical frustration caused by competing nearest-neighbor exchange interactions J1 along the chain direction and J2 across the chains, these materials exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena ranging from conventional Néel order at low temperatures down to disordered paramagnetic phases [5] .\nIn this work we consider two prototypical representatives of this class of materials: CuGeO3 [6] , where each plane consists of edge-sharing tetrahedra forming a honeycomb-like network [7, 8] , and BaCo2As2 [9] , where the planes are made up of corner-sharing triangles [10] . Both compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their unusual magnetic behavior [11, 12] . For example, it was shown experimentally that in CuGeO3 the system undergoes a transition from a collinear antiferromagnetically ordered state below TN = 29 K to a non-collinear VBS state above T* ~ 70 K [13] .

We show that these flows are governed by an exact functional differential equation which is derived using the background field method. The solution to this equation yields all possible counterterms needed to render the theory finite at any order in perturbation theory. This result generalizes previous results obtained within the context of flat space-time. In particular we find that the beta functions for the gravitational couplings do not vanish even if one considers only pure Yang-Mills theories without matter fields. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the running of the gravitational coupling constants can be determined completely in terms of the beta functionals associated with the non-gravitational sectors. Finally, we discuss how our formalism may be used to study the effects of radiative corrections on black hole entropy. Introduction: Gauge theories play a central role in modern particle physics. They provide a description of fundamental forces such as electromagnetism or weak nuclear force. However, it has been known since the early days of QED (quantum electrodynamics) that perturbatively quantizing gauge theories leads to ultraviolet divergences. These divergences have to be removed by adding appropriate local counterterms to the classical action. It turns out that there exist infinitely many different ways to add these counterterms so that the resulting effective action remains invariant under the original gauge symmetry transformations. Therefore, the choice of the correct set of counterterms depends crucially on the regularization scheme chosen to regulate the infinities appearing during the calculation of Feynman diagrams.

We find that the infrared luminosity is consistent with heating by AGN radiation or supernovae remnants within the central kpc region. This suggests that recent feedback energy release has been occurring in these cores. These results are important because they provide new evidence on how supermassive black holes grow through accretion onto their host galaxy centers.

Introduction \n \n Supermassive black holes reside in the center of most massive galaxies. Their growth is thought to be fueled by gas inflow driven by gravitational torques produced during mergers and/or interactions between galaxies (Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Hopkins et al. 2006) . However, it remains unclear what happens after this fuel supply runs out. One possibility is that the black hole continues growing via radiatively inefficient accretion flows (Narayan & Yi 1994) , which may produce powerful winds and jets that can drive large-scale outflows into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) (Silk & Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ).

Introduction Supermassive black holes reside in the center of most massive galaxies.Their growth is thought to be fueled by gas inflow powered by gravitational torques produced during mergers and / or interactions between galaxies ( Barnes & Hernquist 1996 ; Hopkins et al. 2006 ).However, it remains unclear what happens after this fuel supplier runs out.One possibility is that the black hole continues growing via radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( Narayan & Yi 1994 ), which might produce powerful winds and jets that can drive big - scale outflows into the surrounding interstellar medium ( ISM ) ( Silk & Rees 1998 ; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ).Another possibility is that the black holes become dormant as the ISM gets too hot to cool efficiently ( Bower et al. 2006 ; Croton et al. 2006 ) until another merger event triggers renewed activity.Understanding the mechanisms responsible for shutting off black - hole growth will help us understand why some galaxies have large black holes while another do not.2.Previous Work Several studies have shown that there exists an anti - correlation between the mass of the central supermassive black hole and the stellar velocity dispersion of its host galaxy bulge ( Ferrar"

The main idea behind this concept is that we consider not only finite subcomplexes but also their infinite analogues - so-called coverings. We show how covering homology can be used for studying properties of infinite graphs such as amenability or hyperbolicity. In particular, we prove that if a graph has infinitely many ends then its first covering homology group vanishes. This result generalizes the classical theorem by Stallings on groups with infinitely many ends. Covering homology provides us with new tools for investigating various classes of infinite objects in mathematics.

The critical planet mass decreases with increasing disk viscosity because higher viscosities lead to more rapid angular momentum transport across the planet's orbit which reduces the planet's ability to accrete gas. For fixed viscosity, we find that the critical planet mass increases with decreasing surface density power law index because lower values of this parameter correspond to steeper radial profiles of the disk's surface density which leads to stronger gravitational torques exerted by the planet.

In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state. The effect of local coupling is more pronounced than global coupling since the former allows for faster relaxation timescales. Finally, we show that these results hold true also if the initial state has some degree of spatial correlations.

        "original_text": "We present an algorithm for generating new solutions to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations, starting from vacuum solutions and adding scalar fields in such a way that the resulting solution is minimally coupled.  The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions. Our results may also have applications beyond gravity theory, e.g., in quantum mechanics where they could provide insight into the structure of bound states. Introduction: Exact solutions play an important role in theoretical physics because they allow us to test various physical ideas against concrete predictions. However, finding exact solutions to physically interesting problems often turns out to be very difficult. For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found [1-3]. Even today there exist many open questions about black holes [4] . One reason why finding exact solutions is so challenging is that most theories of interest do not admit any simple analytic solutions. Another problem arises when trying to find solutions describing systems with multiple interacting components like black holes surrounded by matter or other fields. Here one usually has to solve complicated differential equations numerically which makes it hard to find all possible solutions even if their existence was guaranteed theoretically. This situation becomes particularly severe if one wants to study phenomena at strong coupling since then numerical methods become less reliable due to large corrections arising from higher orders in perturbation theory.",

Chemical systems often exhibit complex spatial structures such as stripes or rings which form spontaneously without any externally imposed symmetry breaking [1] .

The results show that the observed supergranule is characterized by a strong upflow at its center, surrounded by weaker downflows. We find that the horizontal flow pattern consists of two counter-rotating cells which are connected to each other through a narrow channel along their common boundary. This structure resembles the magnetic topology of a bipolar sunspot pair. In addition we observe a small-scale vortex-like feature located on one side of the central upflow region.

The SFR surface density is found to be an important parameter controlling the conversion factor XCO = M(H2)/L(CO), which we derive by fitting the observed L(HCN) / L(CO) ratio versus metallicity relation. For low values of ΣSFR < 1M⊙ yr-1 kpc-2 , corresponding to quiescent disks or nuclear regions dominated by old stellar populations, we obtain XCO ≈ 2 × 10 20 cm−2 K−1 km−1 s.

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers [1] . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity [2] . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory [3] , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc [4] .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value [5] . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane [6] . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system [7, 8] . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3 [9] or LaAlO3 [10] onto the surface of cuprate superconductors.

This correlation persists even when we restrict our analysis to late-type spirals, which are known to have flat rotation curves. These results suggest that the observed scatter in the Tully-Fischer relation may be due primarily to variations in SB among galaxies of similar luminosities rather than differences in their masses. In addition, we show that this effect can explain why previous studies found no significant dependence on inclination angle in the TF relation.

        "original_text": "Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary force that can increase genetic diversity and accelerate evolution, but it also has negative effects such as disrupting co-adapted gene complexes or introducing deleterious mutations into recipient genomes. In this study we investigate how HGT affects the mean fitness of unicells evolving under different environmental conditions using computational models. We find that HGT increases the mean fitness when cells are exposed to fluctuating environments with high levels of stressful events. However, if there are only mild fluctuations then HGT decreases the mean fitness because it introduces harmful mutations. Finally, for constant environments without any external stresses, HGT does not affect the mean fitness at all. Our results suggest that HGT may have played an important role during early stages of life's evolution by increasing its adaptability to changing environments. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), which occurs between organisms sharing similar DNA sequences, is one of the most significant evolutionary forces known today [1] . It allows rapid acquisition of new genes and thus contributes to increased genetic diversity within species [2] , accelerates evolution [3] , and facilitates adaptation [4] .\nHowever, HGT also has some disadvantages including disruption of co-adapted gene complexes [5] and introduction of deleterious mutations [6] . Therefore, understanding the effect of HGT on population dynamics requires careful investigation [7, 8] . Previous studies suggested that HGT could be beneficial for populations living in fluctuating environments [9] while detrimental for those inhabiting stable ones [10] . Here we use computational models to explore these hypotheses further and show that HGT can either increase or decrease the mean fitness depending on the type of environment inhabited by the cell population.",

The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.   The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.   The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.    This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.  It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.  In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.

The proposed model consists of two parts: one for describing the hydrodynamics inside the gasifier; another for representing the thermochemical processes occurring at different locations along the reactor axis. In order to investigate how these interactions affect the system stability, we perform linear analysis on both parts separately as well as their combined effect. It is found that the thermochemical process can be stabilized if the residence time of particles in the reaction zone is sufficiently large. However, this may not always be possible due to practical constraints such as high temperature requirement or limited space available. Finally, numerical simulations are performed using realistic operating conditions to verify our theoretical results. Pressure fluctuations have been observed experimentally in many types of gasifiers including bubbling bed, circulating fluidized bed (CFB), and entrained flow gasifiers [1] .

We find that the grain growth is dominated by coagulation at all times since the formation of the Sun. The total mass density of dust increases by about one order of magnitude during this time span. This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres. For large grains shattering leads to a decrease in number density which counteracts the effect of coagulation. Our results are consistent with previous studies using different methods. \n \n Keywords: Interstellar medium",

The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets there exists at least one set which contains exactly one element from each set.   In this article we show that if the universe has an underlying quantum structure then it follows that the geometry of time can be described by using the axiom of choice to select a single point on every trajectory through spacetime.   We also discuss some possible implications of our results for neurobiology where the quantum Zeno effect may play a role in explaining certain aspects of brain function such as consciousness. The geometry of time is the mathematical description of how space-time evolutes over time [1] . It was first introduced into physics by Hermann Minkowski [2] who showed that the geometry of space-time could be represented by four numbers (x,y,z,t) called coordinates or co-ordinates. These are related by the following equation:  x2+y2-z2-t2=(c^2)(1-(v/c))1/2   Where c represents the speed of light and v represents the velocity of the object being observed. This equation describes the relationship between distance travelled along the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and t-axis respectively. For example, if you were observing someone walking across your living room floor with their back towards you they would have a positive value for the x-axis but no values for the other three axes because they are not moving in those directions. If however you were watching them walk away from you they would have negative values for all three axes except the x-axis since they are still travelling forward in that direction. As another example consider two objects traveling side-by-side down a roadway. They will both travel at the same speed so their velocities will be equal. However, if one car travels north while the other travels south they will appear to move faster than each other even though they are traveling at the same speed.",

We find that for strong enough spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions there is an insulating phase at half-filling which can be understood as a Mott insulator due to the formation of bound states between electrons on neighboring sites. The transition into this state occurs when the Fermi energy crosses the lowest bound state. In addition we show how the presence of disorder changes these results. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our model using semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes. Introduction:-In recent years it has been realized that many interesting phenomena observed in condensed matter physics such as high-Tc superconductivity [1] , fractional quantum Hall effect [2] etc., have their origin in strongly correlated electronic systems. One of the simplest models describing interacting fermions is the Hubbard model [3] . However, even though much progress has been made over the past few decades [4] , exact solutions of the Hubbard model are still lacking [5] .\nRecently, several authors [6] - [8] studied the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the ground-state properties of 1D Hubbard chains by employing various numerical techniques like density matrix renormalization group [9] , exact diagonalization [10] , DMRG [11] , Bethe ansatz [12] , variational Monte Carlo [13] , Quantum Monte Carlo [14] etc.. It was found that depending upon the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the value of Coulomb repulsion U , different phases appear in the ground state.

In this work we reexamine the EPR experiment using modern techniques for measuring correlations between photons produced via parametric down-conversion (PDC).

We show that this problem can be solved by solving a linear program with O(n) variables and constraints (where n denotes the number of vertices), or equivalently by finding the maximum matching on a bipartite graph. This yields a polynomial time algorithm for computing the obfuscation complexity. As a corollary we obtain a lower bound on the obfuscation complexity for any n-vertex tree T . Finally, we prove that there are infinitely many trees whose obfuscation complexities equal their numbers of leaves. The obfuscation complexity of a graph G = (V , E ) is defined as the smallest integer k such that removing at most k edges from G makes it indistinguishable from another graph G' = (V ', E'). In other words, if an attacker has access only to the set of all possible subgraphs induced by some subset S ⊆ V × V then he cannot tell whether he is looking at G or G' unless |S| > k .\nIn this work we consider the case where G is a planar graph. It turns out that in this setting one can solve the obfuscation complexity problem efficiently using combinatorial techniques.

The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes in order to improve lifetime performance. In particular, the source node first transmits data packets using its maximum power level. Then, it switches to lower power levels if no packet has been successfully received within a certain time period. If one or more packets are successfully decoded, then the source node increases its transmit power back up to the previous value. We derive closed-form expressions for outage probability as well as average throughput under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that our proposed scheme can significantly increase network lifetime compared to conventional schemes without compromising system reliability. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. Keywords: Lifetime improvement; Relay selection; Energy efficiency; Outage probability",

The resulting algorithm has computational complexity similar to standard Lasso algorithms but produces more accurate results on simulated data sets as well as real-world examples involving gene expression microarray data. Forward Stagewise Regression (FSR), introduced by Frank & Friedman [1] , is an iterative procedure where each iteration consists of adding a single variable into the current set of selected features based on its contribution to the objective function. This process continues until some stopping criteria is reached such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or meeting a desired level of accuracy [2] . In this work we focus on using FSR within the context of linear models with non-negative coefficients. For example, if our goal was to find genes associated with breast cancer then it would make sense to only select those genes that have been shown to increase risk rather than decrease risk [3] .\nThe main advantage of FSR over other greedy selection methods like stepwise regression [4] is that it does not require any tuning parameters [5] . However, there are two major drawbacks when applying FSR directly to problems with large numbers of potential covariates [6] :  1) It may take many iterations before the final solution converges; 2) There is no guarantee that the final solution will contain all relevant predictors.

We use data drawn from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue to examine this relation over three orders of magnitude in rp. Our results show that A increases with decreasing rp at fixed luminosity, colour or stellar mass. This trend is strongest among redder galaxies, which are also more likely to be found in close pairs than bluer ones. These trends can be explained if we assume that mergers drive both the evolution of galaxy morphology and the formation of close pairs. Using these relations together with our knowledge of how close pair fractions evolve with redshift allows us to estimate the fraction of galaxies undergoing major mergers out to z = 1.5. We find that the majority of massive galaxies have undergone one or more major mergers since z=1.",

Our results are applicable to many combinatorial optimization problems such as maximum weight bipartite matching, minimum cost flow, vertex cover etc., where the objective function has only non-negative coefficients.

The results show that there is considerable variation between individual clones within each type of cell line as well as between different types of cell lines. This suggests that it may be possible to use this information to classify tumours into subtypes with distinct biological properties. In addition, they find evidence that the growth rates are correlated across generations of daughter cells, which could provide insight into how these correlations arise during tumorigenesis. Finally, by comparing the growth characteristics of normal and transformed cells, they conclude that transformation leads to increased heterogeneity among daughter cells. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process can help us develop new treatments against cancer. However, studying the dynamics of cancerous cell populations has been challenging because of difficulties associated with tracking large numbers of single cells simultaneously. Here we report our recent work on characterizing the growth behavior of thousands of individual cancer cells growing in culture dishes [1] . We used an automated imaging system to track the sizes of hundreds of thousands of cells belonging to several different types of human cancer cell lines ( Figure 1 ). Our results reveal significant differences in both average growth rates and growth fluctuations between different types of cell lines: some grow faster than others while also exhibiting larger fluctuations around their mean values [2] .\nWe found that the growth rates were highly variable even when measured at the level of individual clones derived from a common parent population [3] , suggesting that the observed phenotypic diversity might reflect genetic or epigenetic variations present in the original parental population [4] .  These findings suggest that it should be possible to use such measurements to classify tumors into subtypes based on their growth characteristics [5] .",

First, it provides an explicit mathematical formulation for describing physical phenomena at all scales ranging from microscopic scale down to macroscopic scale.

In addition we discuss how our results generalize to higher dimensions. Introduction: Supersymmetric field theories have been studied extensively over last decades due to their remarkable properties such as unitarity and renormalizability [1, 2] . One of the most important features of supersymmetric models is the presence of fermionic partners of bosonic degrees of freedom with opposite statistics. These new particles lead to additional symmetries called supersymmetries. It has been shown that all known fundamental interactions including gravity can be described within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [3] .\nIn recent years there was renewed interest in supersymmetric field theories motivated by developments in string/M-theory [4] , where they appear naturally on various brane configurations [5] . Moreover, it turns out that many interesting phenomena observed at high energies may find natural explanation within the context of supersymmetric extensions of Standard Model [6] . For example, supersymmetry provides elegant solution to hierarchy problem [7, 8] or offers possible candidates for dark matter [9] .\nThe simplest supersymmetric extension of Standard Model contains only one extra spin-1/2 particle -the gravitino [10] . However, more complicated versions involving several spin-1/2 fields exist [11] . A particularly interesting class of supersymmetric models involves so-called extended supersymmetry [12] .

This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts.

Creation is defined by Einstein's field equations as:  G = 8πG/c4T00 where T00 represents the energy density of space-time.  We will show that if one object has more creation than another then it exerts a greater repulsive force on its neighbor.

The former tends to smooth out the QD density profile while the latter leads to its steepening.

We show that these hierarchies can be realized as certain coadjoint orbits of loop groups over complex semisimple Lie groups.   The resulting quantum theories have many interesting features including nontrivial anomalies and non-perturbative effects such as instantons.    In particular we find that the partition functions for these models are closely related to automorphic forms on the corresponding groups; this is known as the Langlands correspondence between representations of the two groups.   This provides a new perspective on the relationship between gauge theory and string theory; it also suggests a possible connection between the Standard Model and M-theory. Solitons play important roles in physics ranging from condensed matter to particle and nuclear physics. They appear naturally in various physical contexts where nonlinear interactions occur, e.g., in fluid dynamics or field theories describing particles interacting via Yukawa potentials (e.g., quarks). A particularly rich class of solitonic solutions arises when one considers integrable systems whose equations of motion admit Lax pairs. These systems include classical mechanics, relativistic field theories, and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Integrability implies that there exist infinitely many conserved quantities and allows us to construct exact solutions using inverse scattering techniques. It has been shown recently by Witten [1] , however, that even though most physically relevant systems cannot be solved exactly, they may still exhibit some aspects of integrability at the quantum level.

        "original_text": "We consider the possibility that our universe underwent two stages of accelerated expansion, first hybrid inflation and then modular inflation.  We show how this scenario can be realized in string theory with an explicit example based on type IIB orientifolds compactified to four dimensions on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular we find that there are many possible realizations of such models which lead to realistic values for the cosmological parameters. The model is consistent with all current experimental constraints including those coming from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as from direct searches at colliders. Finally we discuss some phenomenological aspects of these scenarios. Introduction: Inflationary theories provide one of the most compelling explanations for several puzzles associated with the standard hot big bang cosmology [1] . They predict that primordial quantum fluctuations generated during inflation should have left their imprint on the temperature anisotropies observed today in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [2] .\nIn recent years it has been shown that supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs), like SO(10) , naturally give rise to inflationary potentials [3] , while also providing a successful unification scheme [4] . However, GUT scale inflation suffers from the so-called η-problem [5] : the predicted value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 16ǫ H /η 2 [6] leads to too large CMB quadrupole anisotropies [7, 8] unless ǫ H ≪ 1 [9] or η ≫ 10 −9 [10] . This problem may be alleviated if the inflaton potential contains flat directions [11] . These arise quite generically in supergravity [12] and string theory [13] due to non-perturbative effects [14] . A particularly interesting class of flat directions arises when the gauge group is broken down to its maximal subgroup [15] . Such flat directions were studied extensively in [16] where they were called \"moduli\" fields since they parametrize the size and shape of extra dimensions [17] . Moduli fields play an important role in string theory [18] because they determine the vacuum expectation values of various moduli fields appearing in the low energy effective action [19]",

It is possible that many optically-faint quasars are hosted by less-massive systems such as late-type spirals and/or low-luminosity ellipticals (e.g., Hao et al. 2005). \n \n To understand how supermassive black holes grow over cosmic time, it is important to study both unobscured and obscured active galactic nucleus (AGNs) across a wide range of environments. However, identifying heavily-absorbed AGNs is difficult due to the lack of strong spectral features associated with them. One way to identify absorbed AGNs is through their X-ray properties. For example, Compton-thick AGNs are characterized by very flat X-ray continua and large equivalent widths of iron Kα fluorescence lines (EW>500 eV) (see e.g., Risaliti 2002). Another method is based on the fact that absorbed AGNs tend to exhibit higher X-ray-to-optical flux ratios compared to normal galaxies (e.g..",

We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows.

The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs.

        "original_text": "We report the detection of cosmic far-infrared background (CFIRB) fluctuations using deep observations made by the Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard Akari satellite at 65 and 90 micron bands in the Lockman Hole field, which is one of the most sensitive fields for detecting extragalactic sources. The FIS has two photometric channels; N60 band covers 60 to 120 microns while WIDE-S channel covers 50 to 100 microns. We used data taken during the period between February 2005 and March 2007. After removing bright point-like objects detected by Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron survey, we performed aperture photometry on all remaining pixels within an area of 1 deg2 centered around the Lockman hole. To estimate the contribution from Galactic cirrus emission, we subtracted the median value of each pixel after applying a 3 sigma clipping method. Then we calculated power spectrum density (PSD) of the residual map. By fitting the PSD with a single power law model, we obtained the best-fit slope as -2.1 ± 0.3 at 65 micron and -1.9 ± 0.4 at 90 micron. These slopes are consistent with those expected from clustering properties of infrared galaxies.",

We show that this problem is related to counting certain types of Dyck paths. In particular we prove that for any positive integer n there are exactly C(n) different sequences of diagonals which can be realized by a convex quadrilateral having 2n sides. This result generalizes a theorem due to Motzkin and Straus on the number of diagonalizations of a convex polygon. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Catalan numbers count many combinatorial objects such as binary trees, noncrossing partitions, spanning trees, etc., see e.g.  [1, 2] . The present work deals with another class of Catalan-like objects: triangulations of polygons (see Figure 1 ). A triangulation T of a simple polygon P is defined as follows: it consists of all edges of P together with some additional diagonals connecting pairs of vertices of P so that each interior angle of P becomes at least 90 degrees after adding these diagonals. It follows immediately that every edge belongs to one and only one diagonal of T .\nIn [3] , Motzkin and Straus' celebrated theorem states that if D denotes the set of diagonals of a convex polygon Q then |D| = 2|Q|. They also proved that the number of diagonalizations d(P ) of a convex polygon P equals the number of diagonals of a triangulation of P . \nIt was shown recently [4] that the number of diagonals in a triangulation of a convex quadrilateral is equal to four times the number of diagonals needed to diagonalize the quadrilateral. Thus, the following question arises naturally: What is the relationship between the number of diagonals required to diagonalize a convex quadrilateral and the number of diagonals used in a triangulation?",

The resulting mass functions are then compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Our main conclusions are:  1. Both clusters have similar age distributions but different mass distributions.  2. The observed mass function slopes agree well with predictions made by standard IMF theory when we assume that all stars more massive than 8 Msun were destroyed during supernovae explosions.  3. There appears to be no significant difference between the number of low-mass stars found within the central regions of the clusters as opposed to their outer regions. 4.

In this talk I will review our recent work on simulating primordial magnetic fields with different physical processes involved. The first part focuses on the generation of seed magnetic fields during inflation by quantum fluctuations. We show that these seeds can be amplified significantly after reheating due to the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the decaying inflaton perturbations. Then we discuss how these seeds evolve into large-scale coherent magnetic fields through various mechanisms including inverse cascade, dynamo action and turbulent pumping. Finally, we present some possible observational signatures for future detection.

We find that there exists a new type of 2SC phase where quarks are paired into diquark condensates with different colors but same flavor. This novel phase has been named as Larkin-Ovchinnikova-Fulde-Ferreell (LOFF) state because it was first proposed to describe superfluidity in nuclear systems. In this LOFF state, we show that the gap parameter for pairing between quarks with opposite momenta depends on their relative angle. The magnitude of the gap decreases rapidly when they move away from each other along the Fermi surface. As a result, the energy gap vanishes completely near the boundary of the Brillouin zone.",

We find that, for strong shocks with Mach number M = 10 - 100, only about 1% CRs can be accelerated to ultra-high energy (UHE). This is because most particles are scattered back upstream before they gain enough energy to cross the shock front again. The low efficiency of UHE particle production leads to an upper limit on the maximum proton energy as well as the total CR luminosity produced by such shocks. Our results suggest that the observed fluxes of UHE protons cannot be explained solely by diffusive shock acceleration mechanism operating at cosmological shocks.
