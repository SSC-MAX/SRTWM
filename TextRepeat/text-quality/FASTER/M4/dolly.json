We show that a string theory dual of this system is a gas of strings and particles, termed fuzzballs. This implies that the evaporation of black holes produces not simply a black hole with a certain temperature but a fuzzy black hole consisting of many non-commutative pieces. In particular, we argue that a precise definition of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for fuzzballs is the string statistical parameter, /b/ = 2pi/3. We provide strong circumstantial evidence for our claim by reproducing the semiclassical limit of the degeneracy of states (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the spectrum of low-lying states (greybody factors) from first principles in string theory. We find that the spectrum and symmetries of the low-lying states are in good agreement with those of a scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state, which is related to the thermal state by a Penrose process. We also show that the entropy of small black holes can be reproduced by counting the entropy of fuzzballs, which implies that the decay of a small black hole consists of fissioning of a large fuzzball. Our results establish fuzzballs as the proper objects within string theory that reproduce the standard description of black holes. Because the fuzzball partition function is likely to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/b, where b is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, we also establish /b/ as a physical observable of string theory.",

Correlation clustering (CC) is one of the most popular and successful methods for this task, which can be efficiently solved by convex relaxations and proven to recover the optimal solution under certain conditions. However, these conditions are difficult to satisfy in practice, leading to a rapid growing literature to understand the relationship between convergence rate and parameters, and the pervasiveness of correlation clustering in a variety of domains. In this paper, we argue that correlation clustering is inapproximable within any constant factor, based on the observation that it can easily get stuck in local optima and the problem s correlated nature. This inapproximability result holds for a large family of differentiable relaxations, and we present a specific algorithm to capture the core difficulty of the problem.

Due to the strong radial velocity signature of a massive planet, coupled with a sensitive Doppler survey, the system was identified as a promising target for the CARMENES instrument. When first observed, the planet was 3.5 hours behind its star, taking 47 days to move ahead by one full star diameter. The slow motion together with the very low metallicity of the star, which is 12.5% of the Sun s, suggests that the planet formed at greater distance from the parent star and migrated inward via torques induced by the star s gravity. If this scenario is true, the time required for the planet to move from its birth place to its current orbit is expected to be 1.5 million years, which is comparable to the estimated age of the system. This planet provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the frequency of Earth-like planets around low-metallicity stars and to test theories of planet migration.",

However, the computation of Bayesian deformer models is often challenging due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. Recently, variational inference (VI) algorithm has been proposed and shown to be efficient in calculating the approximate posterior distribution in Bayesian deformer models. In this paper, we develop a novel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SAA) based on VI algorithm to further improve the calculation efficiency. The proposed method is firstly derived in a general Bayesian deformable model, and then applied to some specific Bayesian deformer models for demonstration.

This allows us to capture dynamics in large, complex quantum systems that are represented by very sparse matrices. We apply our technique to the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a paradigmatic model of quantum phase transitions. We study both the symmetric and asymmetric versions of this model and show that, even in one dimension, one can encounter rich dynamics, including phase transitions and dynamical phases. We also study the hard-core bosons on the square lattice using a quantum simulator and find excellent agreement between our results and those from exact diagonalization. Finally, we use this approach to study the solution of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model at finite temperature.

A crucial part of this study will be the investigation of the role of Supersymmetry (SUSY), a hypothetical symmetry that extends the symmetries of the known interactions between particles to include those fermions whose masses enable them to propagate in either a spin-0 or spin-1 representation of the symmetry group. One of the most popular models that has enjoyed great success in reproducing the observed particle spectrum is the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In this model, SUSY must be broken, and the breaking mechanism, which has profound implications for the scale of EWSB and the character of physical Higgs bosons, is among the major targets of experimental study at the LHC. The MSSM Higgs sector comprises two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons, Hplus and Hminus. A crucial test of this model is the determination of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the observed Higgs bosons. The large sparticle masses predicted by the mSUGRA model motivate a particular benchmark region known as the focus point region, which exhibits relatively light Higgs bosons, in particular a 126 GeV Higgs boson. The observation of a Higgs boson with these characteristics would be a strong indication of supersymmetry and would greatly strengthen the case for this mysterious energy scale. In this letter, we present the prospects for the detection and measurement of this 126 GeV Higgs boson at the 14 TeV LHC, including both direct reconstruction in the di-Higgs plus final state and more prosaic measurements based on the observation of its decay products. We examine bothgg production via gluon fusion and VBF, the t-, W-, and Z-associated production modes, and the associated production with bottom quarks or gluons. We focus on analyses performed by the ATLAS experiment and make use of 13 TeV data with an expected 15-20 fb-1 of total LHC luminosity. The reach of this study is strongly dependent on the decay mode of the 126 GeV Higgs boson. If this Higgs boson is a SM-like Higgs boson, it will be challenging to observe, particularly in the gluon fusion production mode. However, if the 126 GeV Higgs boson has either a large amount of decay to bottom quarks or it has a high proportion of decay totau lepton pairs, then this study will have good sensitivity to these scenarios, and the ATLAS experiment, with its excellent di-tau trigger, will be well-positioned to make the discovery of such a Higgs boson.",

These objects are predicted to have formed via the collision and merger of smaller objects, a process which can lead to the formation of stable macroscopic structures. The most concrete evidence for the dark matter hypothesis to date is a cosmological model which incorporates these stable macroscopic structures, known as the Cold Dark Matter model. This model successfully predicts the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today, prompting comparison to similar models in the particulate physics domain, where a similar level of agreement has been achieved through the use of quantum zero-point energy. Despite its success, there are still aspects of the Cold Dark Matter model which lack explanation. Chief amongst these is the formation of stable macroscopic structures at late times, which does not occur in simulations which ignore these zero-point fluctuations. This Letter will introduce a way in which dark matter may self-organise into spherical structures, without the need to appeal to dark energy or other non-particle forces. Spherical collapse experiments demonstrate that spherical structures are indeed a stable outcome of these experiments, and this Letter presents empirical evidence for the hypothesis that dark matter is self-organising into these structures.

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging demonstrates that the GeMn columns are formed by accumulation of smaller grains at the end of larger ones. Transmission electron microscopy tomography analysis shows that these small grains are enriched in Mn with respect to the substrate composition. The GeMn composition strongly varies across the columns.

This provides a geometrical interpretation of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity dynamical variables as an (2+1)-dimensional analogue of the relativistic membrane. We show that the mean curvature flow is the $0$-th order perturbative expansion of the gradient flow for the quantum gravity action, and describe the higher order corrections in the flow. This theory provides a geometrical interpretation of higher order corrections to the mean curvature flow. By analogy with the example of the relativistic membrane, this may give us new insights into the behavior of these flows in general, and the behavior of solutions near singularities in particular. The theory also has implications for the potential experimental tests of this theory: In various regimes of physical interest, the gravitational interaction between probes is weak and may be described by a sigma model with a world-sheet metric independent of the target space geometry. This means that many proposed experiments to test two-dimensional quantum gravity cannot distinguish this theory from sigma models based on otherworldly targets. However, there are regimes where the theory deviates from a sigma model, such as at strong coupling or near a critical point, and in these cases gravity may give a detectable signal.

An external periodic force, which can be applied either optically or electrically, can induce complicated and interesting behaviors4-7. In this Letter, we report a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme to find high-dimensional chaotic attractors in the semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber. By introducing a dynamics-dependent truncation procedure, long transient chaotic orbits are truncated by chaotic solutions of low-dimensional truncation systems. With this truncation scheme, we are able to observe novel dynamical behaviors in semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber, such as intermittency and bifurcations from torus to strange attractor. Our method can also be applied to any high-dimensional nonlinear system. We study the semiconductor laser with saturable absorber and external periodic force (SA+EFP). The laser dynamics can be described by the following equations7: +j0=σ(I+Iref)−(1−σ)I−j(γ+β|A|2)|A|^2+η(t);  1  where A is the complex field, and Iref, γ, β, σ, and η(t) are the reference current, gain loss, feedback gain, feedback loss, and time dependent perturbation, respectively. |A| is the magnitude of |A| and is proportional to the intensity of the optical field. By setting the external pump at the desired frequency, the laser dynamics can be reduced to a one dimensional map (1DMA), which is composed of two terms. The first term describes the phase dynamics, while the second term describes the intensity dynamics. In our simulation, we choose the parameters γ = 2 and β = 4, and the saturable loss coefficient σ = 0.8. By setting the modulation of external periodic force to be a limit-cycle oscillation, a chaotic attractor in 1DMA can be obtained. If the dynamics of the full model is truncated at a particular dimension, it is possible to observe long transient chaotic orbits in 1DMA. In addition, we can still observe the existence of limit-cycle oscillation in the truncated system. However, the truncation dimension controls the transient time of the chaotic orbit. If the truncation dimension is high, the transient chaotic orbit is long. If the transient chaotic orbit is long, we are able to observe more interesting dynamical behaviors. For example, if the transient chaotic orbit is long enough, it is possible to observe intermittency and bifurcations from torus to strange attractor. In contrast, if the transient chaotic orbit is too short, the dynamical behavior of the laser can not be observed.",

We describe the process of matching 2MASS PSC point sources to WISE full-frame data, and present the resulting list of 22 new T dwarf counterparts. New T dwarfs found include the 23rd and 24th nearest star to the Earth, Teegarden s Star and Doornos  Star, respectively, and the closest known T dwarf binary, 2MASS J0746425+2000315. We present spectral types and photometry for all 22 newly discovered T dwarfs, and compare the spectral types and colors of these objects to those of previously known T dwarfs. Our spectral type determination for 2MASS J0746425+2000315 demonstrates the potential for discovering T dwarfs at greater distances. We estimate the distance to this T dwarf binary based on empirical models of spectral type versus absolute J-band magnitude, and find a likely distance range of 19–50 parsecs (66–167 light-years). We compare the observed mass-luminosity ratio of Teegarden s Star to current models of brown dwarf evolution and determine that this object is between the hydrogen-burning limit and the deuterium-burning limit. Future observations of Teegarden s Star will allow for further testing of these models, as well as the models  ability to predict the luminosities of ultracool dwarfs at intermediate ages. Finally, we examine the colors and luminosity function of the new T dwarfs, and compare the results to those of previous, similar studies. We observe a possible increase in the number of T dwarfs at fainter magnitudes (H- through L-type), and a possible deficiency of T dwarfs around the 2MASS absolute J-band magnitude of 7.5. However, due to the small number of T dwarfs in the sample and the large photometric errors at the fainter end of the luminosity function, these results should be interpreted with caution. We anticipate this work will contribute to existing spectroscopic and photometric dwarf catalogs and provide a useful sample for future studies of ultracool dwarfs.",

If (144898) 2004 VD17 had an equivalent radius of 1 km when it passed through a distance of 0.0435 AU from Earth, it would have a probability of approximately 7.2 × 10−13 of making a close approach to the Earth and a 0.033% chance of impact. Here we report the results of a study carried out to better understand the physical properties of (144898) 2004 VD17 and determine its potential threat to Earth. To achieve this, observations of 2004 VD17 were acquired over two days using the Siding Springs Observatory, complemented by Earth-based radar observations from the Arecibo and Goldstone Observatories and high-resolution visual observations from the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory (UAO). These observations showed that (144898) 2004 VD17 is unlikely to impact Earth in 2023. Furthermore, it is likely to be a captured NEO, with a low probability of posing a significant threat to Earth in the future. Observations of (144898) 2004 VD17 indicate that it is most likely a captured asteroid whose orbit becomes unstable and cross that of Earth every few hundred years. The identification of 2004 VD17 only twelve months prior to its next near-Earth pass in 2023 suggests that it may not be stable on current orbit. This research highlights the utility of wide area surveys in the discovery of potentially hazardous objects. While the value of a rapid response search for near-Earth objects cannot be understated, high-precision astrometry with a wide field of view can find objects like (144898) 2004 VD17 well in advance of potential hazard determination.

Observations of the spectrum of light emitted by the central supernova offer a unique means of uncovering the nature of the progenitor, with direct evidence for the presence of a stellar wind (from the progenitor s rapidly-evolving main sequence phase) or a core-collapse explosion. Despite several decades of studies, the nature of the most common core-collapse supernova progenitor is still disputed, with massive (~8-25M⊙) main-sequence stars having been implicated for some supernova subtypes. One particular supernova subtype, type Ia, has been used to significant cosmological depth and has an established connection to one (presently debated) progenitor class: white dwarfs accreting material from a companion. These descendants of ~8-25M⊙ stars, more commonly known as luminous blue variables (LBVs), have been proposed as a second, less well-understood class of core-collapse supernova progenitors. LBV outbursts (and the cessation of further evolution into a compact object) are generally interpreted as the result of either a sustained increase in mass-transfer from a binary companion, or as the onset of a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star. The region surrounding the supernova 1987A (Tycho) contains a contemporaneous LBV and a SN 1987A-like supernova ( 1988Z). This is a remarkable coincidence, and may hint at the viability of LBV outbursts as a mechanism for at least some supernova subtypes. The ages of the LBV and supernova are comparable, and recent data suggest that the progenitor of the supernova may have been a luminous blue variable - recent simulations suggest that a rare LBV eruption, ~200 years before the supernova, was likely the end point of rapid evolution towards a compact object. It has been speculated that the recent discovery of the  remnant  of a LBV explosion, ~30-60 years after the outburst, could provide compelling evidence for the viability of LBV explosions as a mechanism for supernovae. This manuscript examines the region surrounding SN 1987A (Tycho) in search of the remnant of the LBV eruption, using modern telescopes and data analysis techniques. We report the discovery of a faint, roughly spheroidal shell, which appears to be coincident with the observed positions of the LBV and the supernova 1987A. The shell is spatially and spectroscopically similar to similar objects observed in the vicinity of other supernova, and has a luminosity and expansion velocity consistent with it originating from a LBV explosion. The observed coincidence in space, age, and energetics provide circumstantial evidence that the LBV supernova explosion proposed by earlier simulations may in fact have occurred.",

        "original_text": "In this paper, I argue that quantum mechanics, like other physical theories, can be viewed as a macrorealistic theory that describes the world at a certain level of abstraction. At this level, the quantum world resembles the world described by classical physics. Like classical physics, quantum mechanics relies on generalizations and assumptions that cannot be verified independently. In contrast to classical physics, however, quantum mechanics also requires measurement results to be described by probabilistic laws that are obtained by generalizing the concept of probability.

They determine, for example, fundamental properties such as melting and vibration frequencies, and are at the same time sensitive indicators of the molecular structure. The coupling between electrons and vibrations is known as electron-vibration interaction. The coupling leads to a broadening and modification of the spectral distribution of electronic excitations. The electron-vibration interaction is treated in many-body perturbation theory as a weak interaction. In this approach, properties of the system are analyzed with reference to an effective Hamiltonian that describes the electronic excitation spectrum. In the framework of many-body perturbation theory within the functional integral formalism (dynamical mean field theory), the electron-vibration interaction is described with the help of a systematic expansion in the electron-vibration coupling constant. In this expansion, the first non-vanishing term is called the electron-vibration coupling constant. Up to now, this coupling constant was obtained in second-order many-body perturbation theory. Here, we present the first calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant in covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We show that the commonly used frequency-independent random-phase approximation, which is based on Fermi s golden rule, gives only the first non-vanishing term of this expansion. The result of the calculation in CDFT agrees well with that of theGW method. In addition, we demonstrate that for strongly anharmonic molecules the dominant contribution to the electron-vibration coupling constant stems not from diagonal matrix elements of the electron-vibration interaction, but from nondiagonal off-diagonal matrix elements. These off-diagonal matrix elements are induced by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface. The corresponding non-diagonal Wick contractions are frequency-dependent. Our result indicates that anharmonic effects must be included in a fully consistent calculation of the electron-vibration coupling constant.",

For appropriate choices of the lattice parameters, the system exhibits a variety of quantum Hall states, including the highly-counterintuitive fractionally-charged quasiparticles with charge e/4.

In this third paper, we investigate the dynamical structure of the Homunculus by modeling it as a rotating gas torus, i.e. a donut.

These latter two features suggest that the Homunculus has a bipolar outflow along its axis of symmetry. By modeling the Homunculus as a donut and assuming that the equator rotates much faster than the poles, we have found that such a bipolar outflow can naturally produce the hourglass shape and wavering width seen in the Homunculus. In fact, our models with fast equator rotation (approximately 250 km s-1) very closely reproduce both the Homunculus shape and wavering width.

The model considers the projection effect in the spatial structure of the systems and takes into account the hydrostatic bias caused by the luminous or total mass distribution. We apply our model to interpret the SZ profiles obtained with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and show that the ACT-derived SZ surface brightness profiles can be well fitted by the self-similar form if certain scaling relations are imposed. We also show that there are systematics in the SZ measurements due to the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beam-smoothing effect and propose an empirical method to reduce these systematics. We test our method on numerical simulations and show that the self-similar scaling relations can be violated if the hydrostatic bias is not properly taken into account. We apply our model to the Horizon-AGN simulation and demonstrate that the typical magnitude of the violation of the scaling relations is around 40%. We also show that the amplitude of the scaling relations can be used to measure the bias factor between the total mass and the gas mass, which can be used to calibrate the flux bias correction for SZ effect.

The companion is a main sequence star of spectral type O9.5V, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The orbit of the binary is highly eccentric, with a period of 12.8 years and an apastron of 5.5 A.U. The detection of eclipses and dips, highly polarized gamma-ray emission, as well as the detection of a collimated jet, suggest that the compact object is hidden for most of the time, with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star. The system s dynamic nature has been a matter of debate, with some studies supporting a scenario involving the existence of a third body, while others advocate for the colliding-winds model. In this scenario, the stellar wind from the companion sweeps up and compresses a dense circumbinary disk around the black hole. This disk produces the majority of the observed gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we assess these two models using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic arguments. The main result of this assessment is that the accretion model, though less elegant and more complex, is more successful at reproducing the multiwavelength data. The accretion model for LS I +61 303 relies on the existence of an accretion disk, fed by material captured from the stellar companion. The matter is likely channeled towards the black hole through a hot, relatively poorly ionized magnetospheric outflow. The rate of capture is highly eccentric with respect to the black hole s orbital plane, allowing for a persistent but irregular supply of material to the disk. Thermal coupling between the disk and the magnetic field of the black hole prevents the formation of an externally thin disk, and allows for efficient high-energy emission via synchrotron or magnetically confined jet models. In contrast, colliding-winds models posit that the compact object is a Wolf-Rayet star, composed of a fast-moving WR wind blowing over a dense, slow-moving O-star wind. The system is highly eccentric, with the periastron being the site of the colliding winds. These two winds slow down and collide, producing a complex, partially ionized, region of shocked gas and emission. Although the existence of colliding winds has been demonstrated in the case of massive stars, we demonstrate that colliding winds can also apply to relatively low-mass companion stars, producing observable emission. Furthermore, the emitting region in colliding winds is small and localized, whereas the large orbit of LS I +61 303 requires a distributed emission region. Through a combination of 1-D and 3-D simulations, we show that a colliding winds scenario cannot reproduce the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of LS I +61 303, and predict that the system should be relatively radio-quiet.",

The observation of eclipses and dips , highly polarized alpha - ray radiation , as well as the observation of a collimated jet , indicate that the compact body is hidden for most of the time , with occasional brief appearances as it spirals towards the star .The system s dynamic existence has been a subject of dispute , with some researchers backing a scenario involving the existence of a third body , while several argue for the colliding - winds model .

The MIT is caused by the competition between Jahn-Teller (JT) interaction and electronic (Hund’s) coupling. A microscopic explanation for the observed orbital order has so far been lacking. Here, we present the first microscopic theory for the correlated orbital dynamics in ferromagnetic manganites. We use a multi-orbital Hubbard model for the Mn $3d$ electrons with large separation of Mn $3d$ and O $2p$ orbitals. The model describes the competing interactions in the system and, in particular, accounts for the Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ local spins, which are considered as pseudo-spins. The crucial input of the model is the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the Mn $e_g$ electrons, which is performed in the framework of the Hubbard lattice approach. We find a ferromagnetic orbital liquid phase with vanishing order parameters for the conventional (canted) orbital order and the ferromagnetic one. The Fermi-surface nesting causes a strong renormalization of the bare interactions and leads to the orbital polarization at small JT couplings and a tiny interval of Hund’s coupling, which we estimate from realistic band structure calculations. We argue that the observed MIT in these compounds can be explained without orbital ordering, if the manganese valence is slightly fluctuating.",

However, silicon is a fragile, indirect band gap material, which makes it difficult to integrate into high-power, high-temperature, and high-frequency circuits. Graphene, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, provides an ideal contender for the future electronics. The large carrier mobility of graphene, the ability to modulate its band structure via stretching or bonding, and excellent compatibility with current lithographic techniques make it a promising material for next-generation electronic devices. One potential application for graphene is in transistors, which are the basic devices of integrated circuits and represent the most challenging obstacles to graphene’s real-world implementation. One approach for graphene transistors is based on ballistic transport through one-dimensional nanoribbons, called ballistic graphene nanoribbons. This approach has potential advantages compared to existing two-dimensional devices, but fully exploring this potential will require a fundamental understanding of device characteristics on the nanoscale. Here, we present a full quantum real-space study of ballistic graphene nanoribbon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. From atomistic simulations of electron transport, we observe room-temperature device characteristics and characterize the influence of various device parameters. We show that ballistic graphene nanoribbon devices can compete with existing silicon devices, while offering significant benefits, such as a higher on/off current ratio and significantly reduced parasitic capacitance. Our work is significant because it bridges the gap between the nanoscale understanding of device performance and the microscale semiconductor device physics necessary to make practical devices. The principles developed in this work should be readily extendable to other one-dimensional materials and have implications for the design and understanding of other one-dimensional nanoelectronic devices.

Here we report measurements of the longitudinal and transverse sound transmission through epitaxial interfaces. By varying the orientation of the two crystals, we are able to isolate the interface vibration from the bulk modes. We identify three resonant interface modes and their phonon counterparts in the transmission spectra. The first resonant mode is the lateral surface mode, also known as Rayleigh wave. The interaction between the surface and the longitudinal and transverse waves show quite different behaviours, which is attributed to the change of the polarization of the propagating waves. The second mode is a bending vibration of the reconstructed interface, which is allowed due to the symmetry of the coupled crystals. The third mode is a two-dimensional interface mode.

The thermal SZ effect is specific to each cluster, and its spectral signature can be used to estimate the total thermal energy, the Hubble constant, and the gas mass fraction of the cluster. The non-thermal (or SZ Pauli) effect, discovered a decade ago, has a spatial structure that depends on the particles  distribution and can be used to probe the interaction of the clusters  contents with the energetic particles of the large-scale structure. In this work, we present and analyse X-ray and SZ observations of the galaxy cluster ZwCl 2764. We measure the gas fraction of the cluster and its ICM temperature and density. We also use the SZ observations of the cluster to constrain the Hubble constant. We find a best-fitting cosmological parameters of H0 = 68.2±1.5 km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with the results obtained from other cosmological probes.",

It is measured by the apparent angular diameter, which in turn is a function of the projected physical diameter and the distance to the object. Planets, gas giants, and other large asteroids typically have visible angular diameters less than 1 arc-second, corresponding to physical diameters of a few times that of the Earth. However, when considering smaller objects in the solar system, such as comets, asteroids, and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), their sizes become much more difficult to determine. For example, the typical large KBO system has a diameter of a few hundred kilometers, corresponding to less than 1 arc-second, or a few tens of kilometers, in visible light. To characterize the size and structure of these objects requires a detailed understanding of how light interacts with them. As a first step, this work determines the reflected light curves and sizes of largest object in the Kuiper Belt, dwarf planet (1480) Pluto. Using observations in the visible and infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the apparent diameters of Pluto and Charon as a function of phase angle, and produce the first light curves of Pluto and Charon. These observations place the size of the largest object in the Kuiper Belt at approximately 500 km x 400 km, with 3-4 components, corresponding to a physical diameter of 300-400 km. For the first time, this work presents light curves for Pluto and Charon which can be used in additional analyses of the Kuiper Belt to determine physical and chemical properties. In general, Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are extremely cold, dark and distant worlds. Located beyond the orbit of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt is the third zone in the Solar System, beyond the inner main belt and the asteroid belt, and is characterized by a myriad of small icy bodies. The Kuiper Belt contains the asteroid belt s most primitive objects as well as the largest and most geologically inactive bodies in the Solar System. In spite of the fact that Pluto, the smallest and most distant known member of the Kuiper Belt, was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006, it is the only one for which no light curve was available. Thanks to observations carried out between 2014 and 2018 with Hubble and Spitzer, we were able to characterize the shape, size and structure of Pluto. This work joins a long list of Kuiper Belt Object light curve measurements that began with 1994 QB1, and which include such diverse objects as 2012 VP113, Varuna, Haumea, Makemake, Eris, and (136108) 2004 BF3.

We present an analysis of Milky Way globular clusters with high-resolution UV-visible photometry from the SUVRAMA survey of 23 clusters in the Fornax galaxy cluster. We find the cluster color-metallicity relation to be tighter than recent Milky Way halo field population studies, and further we demonstrate that the color-metallicity relations for Milky Way clusters can be parametrised as a function of host galaxy spheroid mass. With this empirical relation, we show that Milky Way clusters have peaked in metallicity at a solar-mass host galaxy, and that there is no evidence for subsequent stellar population gradient within individual clusters. We propose that the tightest color-metallicity relation for Milky Way globular clusters is driven by the deeper potential wells of more massive galaxies, with metallicity peaking in individual clusters at approximately the same value irrespective of host galaxy mass. We also compare our findings to those of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the peak metallicity of Milky Way globular clusters is broadly consistent with the highest values seen in simulated galaxy cluster cores. However, at present, it is not clear whether observed abundance trends with host spheroid mass can be reconciled with the highest-redshift galaxies in the simulations. Our results offer new empirical constraints on the efficiency of chemical enrichment in galaxy clusters, as well as improved empirical scaling relations for the metal-rich Milky Way globular cluster system.

We first derive the maximum average distortion-rate function for the infinite-buffer case. Then, we characterize the average distortion for the finite-buffer case, and further extend our results to the general case with non-vanishing delay.

This background noise profoundly alters the way in which incoming synaptic currents are represented in the postsynaptic cell, which may, in turn, affect neural processing and behavior. We used whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from cortical layer 2/3 neurons in a brain slice to characterize the noise present at individual excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts. We found that the power spectrum of synaptic current fluctuations was typically very low-pass, with a corner frequency that varied between synapses but was frequently in the tens of hertz.

We then used a numerical technique known as dynamic mesh simulation to predict the voltage response of the neuron to arbitrary synaptic current inputs. We found that synaptic current fluctuations tended to broaden and reduce the amplitude of postsynaptic voltage responses to step changes in current input, but also introduced significant fluctuations in the time it took the voltage response to reach its peak value. The former effect likely diminished the efficacy of synaptic transmission, whereas the latter may have broad physiological implications, potentially contributing to noise-induced decorrelation of postsynaptic spike times.",

        "original_text": "Researchers around the world are making large, ever more complex simulations of the universe. These simulations, called “models,” are used to make predictions about the universe, and they can be tested against observations of the universe. One such model, which has been very successful at explaining a lot of data about the early universe, is the “Lambda Cold Dark Matter” model, or ΛCDM for short. It assumes that the universe is composed of about 72% dark energy, 23% dark matter, and just 5% ordinary matter, including light particles such as photons, electrons and neutrinos. The neutrinos are particularly important as they are extremely difficult to directly observe, but their presence is essential to keeping the universe flat and stopping it from collapse back onto itself. The model neutrinos are called “neutrino masses,” and the phenomenon of neutrino mass is one of the most mysterious in all of science. In the early 2000s, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detected a significant decrease in the speed of neutrinos moving through space-time, which suggested that neutrinos might have a tiny but non-zero mass. Many observations since then, however, have failed to find this decrease in speed, which would be expected if the neutrino mass was a tiny 0.1eV. On the other hand, various extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos might have a non-zero mass. These include the see-saw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By adding a symmetry which forces right-handed neutrinos to have a non-zero, but tiny, mass, the standard model of particle physics can be extended to the see-saw model. Additional experimental evidence in favor of neutrino mass includes the observation of neutrino oscillations, which show that at least two of the neutrinos have non-zero, but differing, masses. Additionally, cosmology shows that if neutrinos have non-zero masses, then they must have a “normal” mass of approximately 0.05eV or less. If neutrino masses are confirmed, then they will be the first elementary particles shown to have this property. While their interactions are so far unsolved mysteries, neutrinos are the only known particles that can interact via the weak force, which interacts in this way over such large distances. The observation of neutrino masses would be a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe.",

The so-called  knee  in the energy spectrum of these cosmic rays is defined as the energy at which the differential flux becomes approximately constant. There are two conflicting hypotheses for the nature of this  knee . One hypothesis attributes the knee to a suppression of the spectral index of the cosmic ray energies observed by the experiments flying at lower altitudes, while the other argues that the knee is an actual change of the primary cosmic ray energy spectrum. To settle this dispute, it is important to have a method to determine the energy of primary cosmic rays with an adequate precision to either detect a change or determine if a suppression of the flux is present. The GAMMA (Gamma-ray Astronomy in the Initiative Era) experiment, designed for the detection of gamma-rays produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, can contribute to this problem because, in contrast to most other cosmic ray experiments, it is able to measure the energy of primary cosmic rays with an absolute accuracy of approximately 30%. In this work, we present spectra of primary cosmic rays measured by the GAMMA experiment for four different rigidities of the experimental setup. We found that the differential flux of primary cosmic rays decreases with energy approximately according to a power law with an index of −2.59 at rigidities greater than 10^{18.5} eV/(γ-1), where γ is the Lorentz factor of the primary cosmic ray. For rigidities between 10^{18.5} and 10^{17.5} eV/(γ-1), the energy spectrum of cosmic rays starts to slowly flatten, indicating a possible change in the energy spectrum. However, the available statistics does not allow us to determine if the change is statistically significant.",

Calculations were performed using the method of rapid adiabaticfollowing, which permits the description of non-adiabatic dynamics by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a mixed normal-Wigner representation Hamiltonian. The simulation method is first validated against experimental reaction coordinates for both the associative and dissociative pathways. The results are then presented for the first truly non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of the oxygen molecule dissociation on Al(111). It is found that the non-adiabatic effects can play an important role in the associative, as well as in the dissociative, pathway, notably by affecting the transition state ensemble. The influence of the substrate in the dissociation process is finally discussed. In particular, these simulations permit the first description of the non-adiabatic dissociation process of O2 molecules on the Al(111) surface. The simulations show that the dissociative pathway is non-adiabatic, whereas the associative one is adiabatic up to the transition state. In the dissociative path, non-adiabatic coupling is very strong at the entrance of the transition state, whereas it is negligible in the associative path. Finally, the simulations evidence that the substrate plays a significant role in the dissociation process. The Al(111) surface hosts two stable configurations for the O2 molecule: 1x2 and 2x2. The 1x2 structure corresponds to the linear geometry with the oxygen atom in the top position and the two hydrogen atoms in the bridge position, whereas the 2x2 structure corresponds to the bent geometry with the oxygen atom in the second position. These two structures differ by the orientation of the molecular axis. In the following, we will refer to the 2x2 O2 structure as “bent” and to the 1x2 O2 structure as “linear”. Initially, the O2 molecule is located on top of the surface in the linear geometry, either in the top or bridge position. A sufficiently high energy excitation could then lead to the rearrangement of the molecular axis with a 1x2 O2 structure, in which the molecular axis points towards the substrate. The nuclear wavepacket corresponding to this excitation has a large amplitude on the top position of the linear structure, and essentially vanishes on the bridge position. These simulations show that the molecular axis is located above the bridge position of the Al surface, as observed in experiments. This excitation could also lead to the dissociation of the O2 molecule into two atomic oxygen atoms. However, only a small portion of the wavepacket localised on top of the linear structure is initially involved in the dissociation process, in good agreement with available experimental data. This means that the associative pathway is adiabatic. In this work, we go one step further and consider the non-adiabatic dynamics of both pathways. For that purpose",

These simulations, however, cannot reproduce the full distribution of galaxy properties at both low and high redshift. It has been suggested that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars may play a role in regulating star formation in their host galaxies. In this paper, we present high resolution, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of a sub-set of galaxies in a single volume of a large, modern simulation, in which a simple model for radio-mode feedback is included. The model is characterized by a constant Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole, which is adjusted so that the AGN contributes a specified amount of radio heating to the interstellar medium. We have selected a simulation which is volume-limited and resolves all galaxies above a given mass, and which includes the effects of stellar feedback, AGN feedback and the evolving gas properties from the larger simulation. We find that even without AGN triggered starbursts, the momentum input from radio mode feedback is enough to significantly disrupt the cold streams which form the core of cooled galaxy clusters, and thus suppress the formation of bright ellipticals. At the same time, this feedback is not sufficient to disrupt the clusters completely. In lower mass galaxies, below the critical cluster mass, we do not see significant suppression of star formation, although we do find a decrease in the concentration of stellar metallicity and stellar density. We conclude that while radio-mode feedback is an effective regulator of star formation in the early universe, it alone is not sufficient to reproduce the full distribution of galaxies across the Hubble sequence.",

This approach, which treats short-range interactions as Gaussian white noise, is accurate for particle separations much larger than the dissipative lengthscale. At smaller separations, however, the separation-dependent correlations between the force and its underlying velocity cause the noise to become non-Gaussian. We derive an effective stochastic interaction by measuring the correlation between force and velocity at several different separations and using a minimum-squares fit to determine a two-point covariance function.

The resulting DPD equations of movement are coupled with a stochastic velocity - Verlet scheme , and the accuracy of the effective interaction is tested by analogy with simulations of thermal equilibrium dynamics .",

The predictions are obtained within the framework of a coupled-cluster expansion for the nuclear wave function, using two interaction kernels: a long-range one, corresponding to the leading order of a systematic chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) expansion, and a short-range one, corresponding to two-nucleon contact interactions. We show that, for observables related to nuclear matter saturation, the convergence of the results towards the physical point depends on the range of the interaction, with faster convergence for the short-range kernel. In addition, for a given range of the interaction, the dependence on the pion mass of the predictions increases as the density of the system under consideration decreases, i.e., as the range of the interaction increases. Finally, we argue that, in order to properly describe the evolution of the nuclearmany-body system with the QCD scale, an appropriate renormalization group analysis of ChPT should be performed.",

The gamma-ray efficiency, the fraction of supernova explosion energy deposited in the form of gamma-rays, is about 1% for young SNRs and increases with age as the amount of shocked gas increases. Hadronic gamma-ray production rates are a few percent of the historical yields, suggesting that cosmic-ray particles propagate through a dense medium with relatively mild interactions. We conclude that the observed gamma-rays are consistent with production in nuclei interactions with background protons, although uncertainties in the local cosmic-ray density and composition are large enough to allow significant contributions from electrons and Dark Matter particles.

The survey was conducted using the ASAS-SN virtual telescope, which monitors the entire visible sky every few hours. Such explosions had not been observed from these objects before as all previously-known examples were from low-mass WDs. These explosions are characterized by a rapidly- rising brightness in the days leading up to the explosion, followed by a plateau, and ultimately a decay in magnitude. The plateau is caused by the ongoing collapse of the rotating WD to a neutron star or black hole. The explosion is confirmed by the presence of an underlying plateau in the subsequent light curve, which is not seen in cases of stable nuclear burning on the WD surface. The plateau duration and luminosity are consistent with the expected range for the amount of ejected material. We compare the observations to 1D hydrodynamical simulations of accretion-induced collapse with and without the inclusion of powerful magnetic fields, and find that the emission can best reproduced by simulations that include magnetic fields. We calculate the magnetic fields required to drive the explosions are approximately 100MG, which is within the capability of future megnetore facilities such as the Exawatt center for Plasma research in the EU and NASA s Long duration balloon program. Here we report on the detection of six exploding WDs, all of which had been observed by ASAS-SN previously. Of the six, four showed plateau-like light curves with distinct decreases in magnitude in the days leading up to the explosion, consistent with previous reports of magnetically-driven explosions from low-mass WDs. Two additional objects, namely SDSS J0804+2052 and SDSS J2315+1855, showed distinct plateau-like decreases in magnitude without the preceding increase in brightness, consistent with the scenario for magnetically-driven explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs for the first time. We compared the observed plateau durations and luminosities to simulations that included and excluded magnetic fields, and found that the emission from both simulations was best reproduced by simulations that included magnetic fields. Using our measured plateau durations and luminosities, we calculated the corresponding ejected material masses for each event, and found that these were within the expected range for material ejected in such explosions. We also determined the probable locations of the progenitor stars by cross-referencing our sample to Gaia Data Release 2 and found that four of the exploding WDs had most likely been observed in the field of view of their respective host galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that explosions from rapidly-rotating WDs are more likely to be detectable from their host galaxies than explosions from low-mass WDs.

In contrast to earlier proposals, our Hamiltonians can be implemented with near-term quantum devices. We consider a general setup with a target unitary to realize and an adiabatic evolution over a time period T. The generated Hamiltonian is allowed to have any term supported on the eigenstates of the initial Hamiltonian, and thus in general cannot be expressed as a sum of bilinears of the form {|,i}H{i,}{,}. We present a general framework to prove that the final Hamiltonian is realizable for the given target unitary, subject to certain regularity conditions. For a special case when the final Hamiltonian is also a sum of bilinears of the above form, we show that the realization can be obtained via gadgets composed of qubit transverters and clusters of surface gates. For a more general case, we provide explicit constructions based on Kitaev’s quantum double model and its adaption for surface codes. We analyze the performance of the resulting Hamiltonians via the Taylor series expansion. In particular, we show that the gap of the resulting Hamiltonian closes at the order of 1/T2, which means the gap closes exponentially at the best rate T−2. This observation implies that for a universal T, the corresponding quantum computer still requires an infinite power of quantum seed state in the starting Hamiltonian to compensate for the error accumulation.

The process relies on the removal of a thin layer of material from one substrate to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. Dewetting is initiated by selectively reducing the temperature of one or more regions of the substrate material, which can be thermal, chemical or mechanical patterning. One typical dewetting scenario is the removal of a thin layer of material from a bulk semi-conductor to produce a thin film of the material on another substrate. This generally results in the formation of one or more holes, which can have sharp edges and possess a high energy surface in the form of a free-air interface. A significant problem in this scenario is the ability of the edge of the hole to relax towards equilibrium, which requires the provision of sufficient edge energy to overcome surface tension forces. In this work, we perform a full-scale hydrodynamic calculation of the relaxation of an initially circular dewetting hole, which is constrained at its edges and is free to move in two dimensions. We compare the evolution of the hole shape and energy with both circular and elliptic equilibrium solutions, and examine the importance of various physical mechanisms for relaxation, including bulk diffusion, convection and surface tension.",

In this paper, we show that for a particular choice of coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields, this higher dimensional spacetime admits a higher symmetry, and the theory appears in one higher dimension as a dual gravitational theory with a doubled number of spacetime dimensions. Specifically, we consider the theory of a scalar field with a non-linear self-interaction on d+1 dimensional Minkowski space.

We show that by introducing a new scalar field conformally coupled to the first one, the system admits a higher symmetry, and reduces to a theory in d dimensions with an emergent ((d-1)+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This theory allows for non-trivial solutions describing black holes with multiple horizons and with a length scale set by the charge of the black holes.

The abstract is very long because it also includes a background on the topic and general comments on the paper. neutron star is the term used to describe a celestial object made almost entirely of neutron, the subatomic particles with the atomic number of indivdual nuclei. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with more mass than that of the Sun packed into a volume of about a cubic kilometer or more. Neutron stars are formed as the result of the supernova explosion that occurs when approximately 99% of a star s mass has been condensed into its core. Such extreme densities are reached because neutrons are so much more dense than normal atoms, and the strong force that binds nuclei together weakens as you get closer to the core. When the core has reached approximately 2-3 solar masses, there is not enough mass to support the core against its own gravity. The excess energy is released as a supernova explosion, also known as a neutron star formation. Most neutron stars are found in close binary systems with another neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole. These systems are known as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). LMXBs are interesting systems to study because they allow us to study neutron stars from two perspectives. The first is   quiescent   (also known as  inactive  or  non-pulsing ) in which the neutron star orbits a more compact companion and is not emitting X-rays. The second is when the neutron star  transientsly  (for a time) increases its X-ray emission, called an  outburst . When an LMXB transits from one to the other state, it is interesting to study the differences between the two states. For example, we have recently shown that transientsly brighter outbursts are associated with an increase of the neutron star s spin period. Conversely, when the neutron star is quiescent, but its X-ray emission is somewhat brighter than normal, its spin period is found to be larger than when the source is significantly fainter. These differences in behavior have suggested a  two-states  model for the behavior of LMXBs. In this model, there are two types of accretion regimes onto the neutron star, with the differences between them explained by different ways in which the captured material is deposited onto the neutron star surface. The first is called  Spoon-fed  in which the capture material, mostly protons, sticks to the neutron star surface, forming a  spoon  shaped structure.

These results were based on data taken between 2008 and 2011. The new data supported the hypothesis that there are at least two sterile neutrinos with square-mass difference of (0.15 - 2.29) eV2 and at least one with a non-zero mass. Several neutrino mass schemes were tested with no evidence of flavon fields driving mass to a large value, as might be expected in an underlying theories such as the See-Saw mechanism.

This paper provides a critical evaluation of recent results from the MiniBooNE and other experiments in light of possible sterile neutrino species. We summarize three common hypotheses for the allowed sterile neutrino masses and mixing, including the minimal, mixed, and two-zero schemes. We present the formalism for each hypothesis and show the associated range of oscillation parameters for three representative sets of light neutrino mass splittings. We discuss potential models for sterile neutrino generation that predict distinct behaviors in each of the three sterile neutrino mass schemes.

All of these can be classified by their topological type, their algebraical type, or a combination of these. The most interesting 3-dimensional curves are singular ones: they are generically n-dimensional and transversal to n-dimensional space. Singular curves are traditionally classified by their genera, i.e. by their codimensions in the parameter space. A comprehensive theory of singular curves was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, see in particular the works of Harris and points of view of Coppo and Garrone. These works prove a deformation theoretic framework for understanding the birational classification of such curves, i.e. their ability to be infinitesimally deformed into another one. This framework implies also that for a generic choice of a curve, there is a plane in the nine-dimensional projective space of quadric hypersurfaces that the curve doesn’t intersect, and such a plane is called an exceptional plane. Curves with exceptional planes are called decomposable. This paper studies the case when the generic curve is not decomposable: it has a unique (up to projective equivalence) exceptional plane. Such curves are called non-decomposable. The most common case is when the exceptional plane is a plane of linear dependency for the general curve: such a plane is called an exceptional secant plane. The present paper develops the theory of such curves, and among other results, gives a birational classification (the so-called Wahl map) and describes how the variety of non-decomposable curves of a given genus (which is open of infinite type) fibers over the space of curves with a given exceptional secant plane (which is of finite type).",

Using explicit correlation as a metric, we show that PNOC energies converge more rapidly than CCD energies with basis set size.

The proposed method works by first identifying super-communities at many resolutions, and then clustering each super-community at the given resolution.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in network clustering, sparked by the development of a wide variety of network data, as well as the ubiquity of network datasets in other fields, such as social media and biology. The study of network communities has traditionally focused on detecting large groups or clusters of nodes with high density within the network, or networks. Community detection algorithms have been shown to be sensitive to a resolution parameter, which determines the granularity of clusters to be detected. Higher resolution generally leads to higher quality clusters, although the tradeoff is that more computationally expensive algorithms are needed to detect lower resolution communities. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical method for community detection that identifies both large and small communities at many resolution levels. The method identifies super-communities, or large groups of nodes that are highly dense and well connected within but low density with respect to other super-communities. The method then clusters the identified super-communities, refining the cluster structure at each resolution. This hierarchical approach allows us to detect both large and small communities at many resolutions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on both synthetic and real-world networks, showing that our method is highly accurate in detecting clusters and outperforms state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.",

The strong force binds the quarks within protons and neutrons in hadrons. The binding energy of a hadron is called its mass. Quarks are believed to be particles that behave like tiny magnets and each come in six different  colors  (representations of the symmetry group SU(3) in quantum chromodynamics, or QCD). The six different  colors  of a quark correspond to the six pieces of a mathematical object called an octet.

The remaining flavors, strange, up, down and bottom, each have a corresponding named hadron. These six hadron names can be combined to formlarger hadrons. For example, the bottom quark carries a small amount of the bottom hadron s charge, so a bottom hadron is a weakly interacting particle containing a bottom quark.

        "original_text": "Astronomers have long known that the universe is full of small particles of radiation known as cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation is of immense scientific value as it was the last light that was emitted at the Big Bang, and thus can be used to probe the state of the early universe. Recently, scientists have developed a model of how this background radiation may be generated by quantum mechanical effects within the universe. The model describes the universe as a sea of zero-point fluctuations, with particles taking on every imaginable (virtual) position in this sea. As the universe expands and its temperature drops, these virtual particles have an increased tendency to settle into the lowest-energy positions, leading to a background of virtual radiation. This model has one key flaw: it does not describe the universe as a collection of particles, but rather a collection of waves. This is analogous to modeling the ocean as a collection of sticks floating on top of a boiling pot of water. The waves are the waves of the ocean, and the sticks are the particles of the boiling pot of water. The particles of the model, the waves of the universe, have not been observed. In this model, the particles of the boiling pot of water are the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As the universe cools, the photons have an increased tendency to assume the lowest-energy positions, that of equilibrium with the cold universe. When the temperature of the universe drops below 3000 K, the photons are no longer in equilibrium with the quantum fluctuations of the radiation, and thus begin to free-stream, moving away from regions of high density and toward regions of lower density. This is analogous to a water bottle left out in the cold. As the bottle cools, water molecules begin to move toward the bottom of the bottle, leaving a region of space with lower density than the surrounding air. In this work, we consider a modified model of this phenomenon, in which the particles (photons) do not move, but the background radiation does. The universe, in this case, has a  frozen sea  where the particles settle at the bottom of the sea but the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe. In this model, as the universe cools, the radiation waves continue to wave throughout the universe but the particles have settled at the bottom of the sea, leaving regions of higher and lower density. This provides a mechanism by which the universe can undergo a phase transition from a state of thermal equilibrium to a state of nonequilibrium, or a cooling dominated phase transition.",

The proof makes use of unique path decomposition for generalized functions. It is shown that the unique path decomposition for the regularization of the Dirac delta mass is weakly isomorphic to the double sequential limit of the unique path decompositions for regularized distributions that appear as simple components in the generalized decomposition. It is further shown that this double sequential limit coincides with the desired pure inductive limit state. The Kolmogorov s property for this pure inductive limit state is then shown to follow from its uniqueness and general properties of inductive limit states. It is further argued that the existence of this pure state but not inductive limit state for the pair of measures described above has several potential applications in mathematics and theoretical physics.

The proof makes using of unique path decomposition for generalized functions .It is demonstrated that the unique path decomposition for the regularization of the Dirac delta mass is weakly isomorphic to the double sequential limit of the distinct path decompositions for regularized distributions that appear as simple parts in the generalized decomposition . It is further demonstrated that this double sequential limit coincides with the desired pure inductive limit state .The Kolmogorov s law for this pure inductive limit state is then shown to follow from its uniqueness and general properties of inductive limit states . It is further argued that the existence of this pure state but not inductive limit state for the pair of measures described above has numerous future applications in math and theoretical physics .The paper offers the results of joint research with E .

Wind properties and evolution of hot massive stars are key to understand feedback from massive stars in their environment, from the morphological structure of the interstellar medium to the chemical evolution of their host galaxy. Combined high-resolution spectroscopy from VLT-FLAMES allows to determine mass-loss rates from H emission, temperature of the bi-conical winds and thus analyze the evolutionary status of these stars. From the mass-loss rates, Ionic masses can be derived and eventually be used to investigate other properties of the winds, such as ionization degrees and acceleration regions with potential effects on simulations of the feedback into the environment. In this contribution we present the first results on the evolution of hot massive stars in the LMC and the impact of this evolution on the galactic feedback. We confirm previous studies which concluded that the initial mass function (IMF) is top-heavy in the LMC, with respect to the Milky Way. The most massive stars show stronger IMF divergence from the initial mass function (IMF) with increasing age, suggesting that these stars were affected by significant mass-loss episodes. We found more extreme cases of stars with abnormally high nitrogen to carbon (N/C) and nitrogen to oxygen (N/O) abundance ratios, which might be the consequence of a thermohaline mixing process occurring in their winds, an hydrodynamic process taking place in the strong winds of massive stars.",

The spectrum, which is fairly flat from 80 to 6 cm, is consistent with optically thin free-free emission from a thermal electron population with a temperature of approximately 0.2 keV.

Such waveforms, which are restricted to the small mass-ratio limit of general relativity, are essential for the rigorous and accurate computation of emitted radiation and the estimation of Source Terms in computational EM and GW astronomy. We demonstrate that, with a single adjustment for the mass ratio, our waveform family, dubbed DECOULper waveform approximates the analytic solution of the effective one body (EOB) equations to < 10^{-4} over the full spectrum of two compact object systems. We show that our DECOULper waveforms, which are computed in close parallel with the effective one body (EOB) equations, are well-suited for use in hybrid waveforms, where radiation from a numerical relativity simulation is infused with the DECOULper waveform at key stages of the evolution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our waveforms using several approaches. First, we show that our waveforms predict the radiation in tests in which we waveform a single, isolated BH.

Super star clusters form through either the direct collapse of giant molecular clouds or through coalescence of smaller clusters. Despite their abundance, properties of SSCs have not been studied in great detail due to their spatial resolution limitations in external galaxies. This has recently changed with the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which has allowed the discovery of much fainter SSCs in the centers of nearby galaxies. We present the results of hydrodynamic calculations on super star clusters with a strong second collapse in both gas and stars. The second collapse forms a second population of stars that can significantly impact the global properties of the SSC. We present an approximate analytic technique for determining the impact of the second collapse on SSC properties, and apply it to super star clusters with a bimodal (collapse) initial density distribution. We show that the ratio of first to second collapse regions in SSCs is strongly correlated with global SSC properties. In particular, SSCs with a strongly peaked initial conditions, such as those formed in cuspy dark matter profiles, have a significantly higher ratio of first to second collapse than those formed in flat or cored profiles. This leads to SSCs with cuspy profiles having a higher median age and lower median stellar mass than those formed in cuspy profiles. This provides a solution to the  core catastrophe  problem, which describes the apparent discrepancy between observations and numerical simulations of cuspy dark matter profiles that suggest SSCs should not be able to form. We present typical SSC properties as a function of both halo profile and initial conditions, and discuss the implications for hierarchical structure formation theories.",

We find that the fragmentation function for the transition from a charm quark to a charged pion can be well approximated by considering the Schrödinger equation for a simple potential model, where the coupling between quark and diquark is parametrized by an effective coupling constant. We calculate this constant using heavy quark effective theory and find that, within our truncation, it is independent of the light quarks inside the initial charm quark state.

        "original_text": "Mechanistic home range analysis (MHRA) is a widely used method for estimating home range size. The method has two steps: 1) space use is modeled as a function of candidate home range spatial variables, and 2) rapid numerical optimization is used to identify the home range that best fits the observed space use data. In the first step, the method is most commonly applied to summary statistics of space use (i.e., point patterns), and a large and growing body of knowledge about space use patterns is used to inform candidate home range spatial variables. Many of these variables are functions of home range size, and fast algorithms have been developed to test combinations of these spatial variables against the observed space use patterns. Although these algorithms quickly screen many spatial variable combinations, all spatial variables are tested simultaneously and many spatial variable combinations never used. The second step is a global search algorithm that uses the home range spatial variable screening results to rapidly identify the home range spatial variable combination that best fits the observed space use data. MHRA is often used to estimate home range size for large sample sizes, but the slow home range spatial variable screening step can limit the method s usability. For example, to estimate home range size for 10 individuals requires 45 model runs (assuming each model run uses a different combination of spatial variables). MHRA therefore requires large computing resources and extensive modeling time. Here, we develop an analytic steady-state space use pattern model that can estimate the area utilized at steady state. Steady-state space use is the area used when space use is continuously measured over a long time period. Analytic steady-state space use pattern models are similar to mechanistic movement models, but the latter do not estimate space use. Analytic models estimate the flux of particles around a central point (home range) while assuming spherical symmetry, and many such models have been developed for different spatial environments (e.g., closed versus open habitats). We couple this model with a global search optimization algorithm to create an algorithm that rapidly estimates the home range area that best fits steady-state space use patterns. The area estimated using steady-state space use is different than the area estimated using MHRA, but they are related and both indices of space use. For small sample sizes, MHRA requires 45 model runs, but steady-state space use area can be estimated using a single model run. The estimated steady-state space use area is more accurate than MHRA area, and it is computed in seconds rather than minutes or hours. We demonstrate the utility of the steady-state space use area by comparing it to the area estimated using MHRA and by using it to reduce the number of model runs necessary to estimate home range size.",

        "original_text": "The astronomical community regularly holds discussions on proposals for new telescopes, and this cycle has now been going on for more than a decade without a new large optical telescope being funded. This lack of new facilities is the result of a misguided approach to proposal evaluation that does not accurately represent the cost of new construction projects, does not fully account for the risk of cost overruns, and ultimately does not reflect the needs of the astronomical community. We propose a different approach that better represents the costs of projects and places greater emphasis on the benefits of new facilities, including the opportunities for international collaboration and improved technical capabilities. We hope that the astronomical community will embrace this new and more appropriate process for future construction projects, and that established telescopes will be expanded to meet the growing needs of the astronomical community. Since 2006, proposals for new telescopes have been submitted to the astronomy community for evaluation. These proposals cover a broad range of cost and technical specifications, and the Evaluation Board for New Telescopes (EBT) has evaluated each proposal based on an evaluation template that has remained essentially the same since 2005. The evaluation process includes several key areas for consideration, including cost, technical design, and management. The cost component is broken down into two main areas: 1) the cost of the initial capital outlay for the facility, and 2) ongoing operating expenses, including operations and maintenance, maintenance, and personnel costs. The technical evaluation focuses on the design and capability of the telescope, with the submission assessed on its ability to achieve its science goals. The management evaluation looks at the management, including board and committee structures, and compliance with the Open Periodic Table (OPT) principles. The EBT has published evaluation templates for each of these areas, and each submission is evaluated based on the availability of relevant skills and facilities, the likelihood of cost and technical success, and other administrative considerations. Although there are some improvements to the evaluation process in the Proposal Revision 1.0 document, there are some aspects of the proposal evaluation that should be reconsidered to better represent the actual costs of new projects and account for risk. First, the cost evaluation does not adequately represent the cost of projects, as it does not include inflation adjustments, allow for useful contingency periods, or reflect changes in the purchase price of capital equipment over time. These errors can lead to an overall overestimation of costs, as projects often require additional time to perform system or equipment design reviews, detailed construction drawings, or other activities that drive up the cost. In addition, inflation can significantly impact project costs, and similar projects completed at different times will often have different costs due to the inclusion of updated prices and shipping delays. Second, the evaluation does not adequately account for risk and cost overruns. As a result, the proposal evaluation does not fully represent the true cost of building a telescope, which can be particularly relevant in the case of international projects, where local political or economic factors can lead to",

Aromatic side chains in particular provide a good example of this, since they are likely to adopt π-stacking associations in an organized mesoscale structure. Such associations, formed via π-π stacking between ring systems, have been identified as critical for many physical properties of practical interest in polymer systems, including crystalline perfection, reactivity, and mechanical behavior. Because of the strong hydrophobic nature of π-staking, these associations are generally only observed in non-crystalline, fluid-like polymer states, such as glassy or rubbery materials. In this study, we provide experimental methodology for the measurement of side chain rotameric populations in model polymer systems, using 1H NMR spectroscopy and a combination of molecular mechanics and empirical potential calculations. The aromatic side chains 4-fluoronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene are examined as a model system, and particular emphasis is given to the quantification of side chain rotameric isomers in crystalline and glassy states.

Because of the strong hydrophobic nature of π - staking , these associations are typically only seen in non - crystalline , fluid - like polymer states , such as glassy or rubbery materials .In this study , we provide empirical methodology for the determination of side chain rotameric populations in model polymer systems , using 1H NMR spectroscopy and a combination of molecular mechanics and theoretical potential calculations . The aromatic side rings 4 - fluoronitrobenzene and 4 - chloronitrobenzene are examined as a prototype system , and particular importance is given to the quantification of side chain rotameric isomers in crystalline and glassy states .In addition to characterizing the impact of side ring identification and conformation on macroscopic physical properties , these results represent helpful reference data for the development and validation of more advanced structural modeling strategies for polymer systems .",

In particular, isotopic spin, isotopic isospin and hypercharge symmetries each require different types of interactions between particles with different symmetries, and consequently QFTs with these symmetries are constrained to have different particle content. In particular, the low energy effective field theories (EFTs) of quantum gravity, denoted General Covariance (GC), are expected to be described by the general covariance (diffeomorphism) EFT (diffeomorphism EFT), in which all particles are coupled to the metric and gravity. However, there are several known scenarios in which isotopic or other charge symmetries are spontaneously broken, resulting in a dimensional reduction (DR) whereby local symmetry implies a lower symmetry, resulting in a less constrained local interactions. Several classes of such scenarios are based on extended gravity, including Kaluza-Klein reduction (KKR), as well as minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity (dS/PSR) scenarios. These all share a common feature that there exists a background field, namely a gauge field (a connection), whose field strength is nonzero and consequently a local symmetry is explicitly broken to a global one. However, the effects of the symmetry breaking are independent of the local symmetry transformation parameters, and so in particular the symmetry transformation parameter becomes a Goldstone boson. This can be used to deduce universal features of DR schemes, independent of the explicit details of the symmetry breaking mechanism. For example, it is expected that all spontaneously broken isotopic or other charge symmetries will result in a reduced local symmetry, with the local symmetry transformation parameter corresponding to a Goldstone boson. In particular, for the minimal de Sitter and Projective Special relativity scenarios, there is an exact symmetry between the local de Sitter (dS) and global Poincaré symmetries, resulting in an exact Goldstone boson equivalence. Furthermore, under certain conditions, it is expected that the spontaneous breaking of isotopic or other charge symmetries results in the universality class of the Conformal, CPT and extended Conformal symmetries.

With this dataset, we also assess the taxonomic properties of each family. We further classify 27 families as S-types and 56 as C-types. S-types are consistent with the high albedo populations described in previous studies and likely include the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 families named after the major asteroid belt S-type asteroid groups. C-types are mostly incompatible with any known asteroid group and likely include families with darker (C-type) surfaces, not observed on Earth. Based on our data and previous studies, we identify two overlapping populations of Trojans: the S-type and the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 family members. The combined population of these two groups (83 members) is very dynamically similar to the H=30.0-34.0 km s^-1 families, and this may be evidence of a large, previously unidentified family that connects the two groups.

This article develops an alternative method which is to start with spraying some cleaner around the floor and let it spread around by gravitational force. The article then develops a probabilistic framework to analyze this method. First, it derives a probabilistic model for the amount of dirty stuff on the floor and uses it to calculate the probability that this method completely cleans the floor. Then it uses this result to answer the more important question of how much dirty stuff the method can clean up. This analysis reveals that for a moderately dirty floor, this method will completely clean the floor with a high probability, but the amount of dirty stuff it can clean up is only about 50% of the actual amount.

        "original_text": "The existence of massive neutrinos is one of the most important discoveries in modern astrophysics and particle physics. Among the three known species of neutrinos, the neutral current interactions of electron neutrinos provide a unique tool to study the interior of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, because electron neutrinos scatter off electrons in the nuclei of nuclei, virtually without interacting with the electrons themselves. This forward scattering process can be observed through the Doppler-shifted weak emission of electron neutrinos, which results in a spectrum that is exponentially suppressed at low energies. The measured intensity of this so-called core-collapse neutrino burst, first detected by the SNO detector in 1998, can be explained only by postulating the existence of nearly massless neutral Majorana neutrinos, which were invented by Ettore Majorana in 1937 and for which evidence was first found forty years later by the KATRIN experiment. In 2006, the first direct experimental evidence for theneutrino s Majorana character was obtained in the scientific journal  Nature  by the Super-Kamiokande detector, when the observation of a tiny but finite probability for the neutrino to be its own antiparticle was reported. Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. The favored model for dark matter, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), can interact via the weak force and therefore are expected to produce the observed signal in conventional neutrino telescopes. However, recent observations of galaxy clusters with satellites such as Planck or the Dark Energy Survey have reduced the maximum possible cross-section of WIMPS to within an order of magnitude of the weak force coupling constant. Since this is orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino scattering cross-section, this possibility for dark matter has been excluded. Neutrino oscillations can easily accommodate the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies, and thus neutrinos offer an attractive alternative to dark matter. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies can capture a finite amount of electron neutrinos, thereby solving the dark matter problem. The process would be analogous to how a lightbulb shines light when electrical current flows through it: The cluster of galaxies acts as a giant lightbulb, and the neutrino beam produces the observed 511-keV radiation. Given the lack of evidence for non-baryonic dark matter and its weak interaction cross-section, we suggest that the observed neutrino burst is actually produced by electron neutrinos scattered off dark matter particles, which might account for approximately 30% of the total dark matter density of the universe. We provide an example of how the existence of this weakly interacting massive particle dark matter could be established or disproved by measuring the spectrum of the neutrino burst from a future core-collapse supernova in our galaxy.",

Such random graphs are commonly generated using one of two paradigms: the configuration model, which assumes a uniform probability distribution for all edge establishment, and the community model, which allows for the generation of arbitrary networks with pre-specified properties. However, different real-world networks may exhibit very different distributions of topological characteristics. Therefore, it is of interest to consider how the distributions of these characteristics may vary across different random graph models. Here we focus on two such characteristics, the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph, both of which have well-understood algorithmic techniques that allow for their exact determination for arbitrary random graphs. By employing a variety of random graph models, we find that the size of the largest planar matching exhibits a power-law distribution for every model considered, while the largest planar subgraph exhibits a power-law distribution in some models and exhibits a different, more exponential-like, distribution in others. Notably, we find that the power-law exponents for the size of the largest planar matching and the largest planar subgraph are closely correlated with the exponent associated with the degree distribution of the graph.

Based on our observations, we suggest that in the optical band PKS 2155-304 was in a high state in early 2005, possibly reaching a flux density of 400 mJy at m_R in April 2005. The NIR flux density was relatively stable during this period, with no strong variations. Around May 20-25 2005 we detected a sharp rise in both the optical and NIR flux, reaching a peak in June 2005. The optical spectral index rapidly hardened in this period, possibly reaching a value of α=3.2. We hypothesize that this sudden brightening in PKS 2155-304 was caused by a rapid enhancement in the external radiation field density (as a result of the eruptinging Galaxy M33) shining through the relativistic jet of PKS 2155-304. We also observe a fast decrease in the X-ray, MeV, and GeV flux densities in the period May-July 2005. We suggest that this decrease was caused by the jet entering a new region with a weaker magnetic field, perhaps due to the increased transparency of the jet caused by the enhanced external radiation field density.",

We provide a simple and unified approach to the classical KYP inequality, including results for discrete-time LTI systems, discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) systems, and continuous-time LTV systems. We also extend the KYP inequality to the case of partial measurements. Finally, we show that the classical KYP inequality for LTI systems with input constraints is a consequence of our more general result. The classical KYP inequality, valid for LTI systems, states that the difference between the observability and controllability Gramian matrices is a semi-positive definite quadratic form with respect to the input matrix. This result has been extended to LTI systems with input constraints (i.e., with zero inputs) by various authors. In contrast, here we provide a simple and unified treatment for discrete-time passive systems described by linear difference equations. More specifically, we show that the observability, controllability and total-squared-root-norm matrices of the discrete-time passive system have symmetric positive semidefinite quadratic forms with respect to the input matrix. As a consequence, we obtain a general version of the KYP inequality for discrete-time passive systems.

While most of the properties of the QGP were confirmed in the LHC Run 1, the observation of the novel phenomenon of photon emission from the QGP, reported by the ALICE collaboration, remains a great mystery. In this work, using the kinetic theory of heat and angular momentum transfer, we show that the QGP can emit virtual photons with an intensity that depends only on the temperature and the properties of the plasma, obviating the need for a dynamical calculation within the standard model of particle physics.

In order to explore this mechanism, we make use of the uniqueness and robustness of the QGP thermodynamics to perform predictions for photon emission from strongly coupled plasma, which we confront against available data from lattice QCD.

The Truecluster matching problem is to find a perfect matching between clusters and points such that the distance between points and their matched clusters is small. In this work, we present a fast algorithm for the Truecluster matching problem that matches each point to the cluster whose center is closest to the point in n-dimensional space.

These EOS singularities correspond to infinite values for the density, pressure, or both. In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of these EOS singularities, focusing on the specific case of finite-time singularities. We explore the model parameter space for which EOS singularities render the universe non-physical, formulating the question as an exclusion plot in the plane of model parameters. We show that such an exclusion plot is significantly restricted by existing data from SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and direct detection experiments, allowing for only a small region of this parameter space. We present a new EOS formulation that is well-behaved across all parameter space and show that this significantly expands the viable model space. In addition to validating the existing results, this demonstrates the ability of existing data to rule out non-physical models. Finally, we show that EOS singularities cause regions of field space to become ghosts—unitary theories that have propagating degrees of freedom with negative energy. Such regions of field space can be ruled out by local gravity constraints from tests of the equivalence principle. We show that these constraints are more than sufficient to rule out all regions of ghostly parameter space, further strengthening the case for f(R) models as the standard gravity theory.",

The evolution of the faint-end slope is much more pronounced, with the bright-end slope found to be α=−1.8⪘(Mλ/−23.5)½−0.5 for Mλ<−24, while most models prefer a much shallower evolution of the faint-end slope, suggesting the presence of substantial cosmic variance in the AGN population, possibly associated with large-scale structure. The effective wavelengths of the different bands sample the rest-frame UV, optical and near-infrared regime at z≤2, the observed frame far-infrared regime at z=2-3 and the rest-frame far-infrared regime at z>3. At all redshifts the LFs are relatively similar, suggesting that the bolometric corrections are almost constant at these redshifts. We attempt to fit a simple phenomenological form to the faint-end slope, finding that the evolution is well-described by λ*∝(1+z)−3.0 for z<2, while at higher redshifts we find λ*∝(1+z)−4.9. We rule out the possibility that the faint-end slope is constant at α=-0.5, finding α=−1.8⪘(Mλ/−23.5)½−0.7 at Mλ<−24. This extreme evolution of the faint-end slope of the AGN luminosity function is driven by the presence of a relatively small number of luminous quasars, with number densities (per unit volume) up to eight times larger at z=3 than today.

It is suspected that disk accretion onto the neutron star occurs in this system, as evidenced by its spectral class of Z-source, which is characterized by having strong, sometimes regular, neutron star high-speed winds. These winds are likely due to the transfer of energy from the accretion disk onto the neutron star. The 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40 was detected with the INTEGRAL observatory on Jan. 28, 2005, and reached a maximum on Feb. 24. The work presented here focuses on the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40 over this time period. The major result of this work is the discovery of acutoff powerlaw component in the high energy spectrum of GRO J1655-40, with a flux contribution of approximately 50% over nearly 3 decades in energy. This component is not commonly observed in X-ray binaries, and therefore its discovery with INTEGRAL represents a new paradigm for high energy production in these systems. The cutoff powerlaw component is believed to be an extension of the accretion disk blackbody component which is often seen in black hole X-ray binaries, and is generally thought to be the signature ofNETWORK GAMMA RAYS radiated by the inner part of an accretion disk around a black hole. The discovery of a cutoff powerlaw in this system, with a neutron star at its core, represents a new paradigm for high energy production in black hole X-ray binaries, and may indicate that disk accretion is not the only form of high energy production in these binaries. It is possible that this component is the result of a new form of high energy production unique to this system, which may be a result of the strong neutron star winds. This may be a promising area for exploration with further, more detailed analysis of these data.",

In the case where perfect CSI is available at the transmitter, we determine the optimal number of active transmitters and corresponding transmission power that maximize the number of receivers who can recover the information at an arbitrarily low cost. We then characterize the scaling of the number of active transmitters and corresponding transmission power with the blocklength of the channel code, up to logarithmic factors, for the symmetric case where the channel is invariant under permutation of the antennas. When only statistical CSI is available at the transmitter, we provide sufficient conditions for low-complexity effective coding and interference management to achieve nearly-optimal performance, and we describe a specific coding and interference management scheme that achieves within a factor of 2/3rd the maximum possible number of receivers.",

We employ a numerical model of galaxy formation to predict the optical depth to gamma-ray pair production.

Straggler identification is an important problem in the design and analysis of distributed systems, and has received much attention in the literature. Classical solutions to this problem build a timestamped logical clock, and often require a prohibitive number of timestamps to converge. More recently, variants of Bloom filters have been used for straggler identification, enabling data stream applications with affordable memory and fast detection. Bloom filters, however, are not invertible, and so existing solutions to Bloom filter-based straggler identification (both in the literature and in commercial systems) are inherently blind: they cannot accurately identify which processes are stragglers. We overcome this limitation by harnessing the power of Newton s identities, a set of three deterministic matrix equations that are invertible. Unlike Bloom filters, our solution can accurately identify stragglers. We describe an algorithm that, using just two timestamps per stream element, can identify straggler processes with high probability, and in particular can accurately identify stragglers to within a set of n processes, for any specified n. We validate our method via extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark data streams, including real-world data from a large-scale production system, and show that our method outperforms the state of the art by orders of magnitude.",

Thanks to high resolution numerical simulations, we discovered two distinct CME dynamical regimes: one fast and one slow. The fast CME, typically released from sunspots, can reach speeds over 1000 km/s. It is powered by the fast reconnection of the sheared magnetic fields, and its impact on the magnetosphere is tremendous. In contrast, the slow CMEs originate from the plage regions and are released through small magnetic x-points, with much lower speeds of around 300 km/s. These CMEs do not significantly disturb the magnetosphere, but can still cause major power grid disturbances and satellite signals losses due to the high amount of flux involved.

Most of these proposed EOSs are based on a transformation of the many-body QHS Hamiltonian such that the quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent mean-field system, with a corresponding introduction of a  quantum liquid  equation of state (EOS) for the nuclear quantum many-body system. This paper critically evaluates this new class of proposed EOSs. After presenting a general critique of the various assumptions underlying the various proposed EOSs, we present a detailed analysis of the proposed EOS for neutron matter, which yields significantly improved analytic results over those previously proposed. We then apply these analyses to a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter, yielding improved analytic results compared to both the widely used QIG EOS and the previously proposed neutron matter EOS. This improved performance is achieved through a new constraint on the EOS, based on nuclear saturation properties at low densities, and a more sophisticated fit to the high-density behavior of the EOS. Finally, we present analytic and numerical results for a proposed EOS for symmetric nuclear matter that yields an EOS that is simultaneously consistent with both the general critique presented and with the detailed analyses of the neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter EOSs.

Next, the many-body Hamiltonian is transformed such that the nuclear quantum many-body system resembles an equivalent system of non-interacting particles (the  mean-field  system) that can be analyzed using standard classical many-body theory techniques. This leads to a new class of proposed equations of state for nuclear matter.

This parameterization of the Hamiltonian allows the authors to fit the predicted EOS to both nuclear many-body theory results and nuclear matter ground state properties. The proposed equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter is then analyzed in detail, yielding significantly improved analytic results over both the widely used Quantum Ideal Gas equation of state and the previously proposed equation of state for neutron matter.

        "original_text": "In string theory, Wilson loops provide a powerful tool to analyze the classical string configurations. For more general gauge theories, in particular for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at large nucleon momentum transfers, the color confinement is better described by quark-antiquark bound states, or mesons, rather than freely moving colored fermions. In particular, a fundamental quantity in the QCD calculation of the hadronic spectrum is the Wilson loop, which, in the light-front formalism, is defined as the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field along a closed loop $C$ in space-time. The fundamental representation of the gauge group is usually chosen. The dependence of the Wilson loop on the loop dynamics is more complicated. In particular, the area law for large loops is no longer true. For small loops, the area law is modified to be proportional to the perimeter of the loop $C$. This phenomenon is called perimeter law. The relation between the area and perimeter laws has been observed for more than 40 years. Recently, by using the supergravity in eleven dimensions, a string theory realization of a long Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ group is proposed. The corresponding string configuration is the graviton with one temporal and one spatial infinite size. This allows a detailed comparison between the field theory and gravity results. For finite-size loops, new Quantum Mechanics-like phenomena may arise. For example, it may admit discrete energy levels with a spectrum linearly proportional to the area of the loop. In this article, we present a more general class of string configurations, which are the finite-size gravitons corresponding to loops with arbitrary shapes. We use the second fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ to represent the loops. The corresponding gravity background is a truncation of type IIB supergravity on S^5 x T^{11}. The quantum mechanics-like spectrum on such backgrounds has been studied before. In particular, the different classical shapes of the loop have different behaviors for the quantum mechanics-like states. We also propose a string interpretation for the observed spectra. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of our results to QCD and discuss possible future work.",

The bright infrared nuclear starburst in NGC4418, shining as a dominant contributor of infrared luminosity in the Antennae system, has been known for many years (Braine et al. 1993, Downes & Solomon 1998). The origin of this starburst and its relation to the buried AGN was a long-standing mystery. New ALMA data of the luminous far-infrared molecular hydrogenCN (HC3N) v=0-1 infrared line emission has now provided us with a clear view of the dynamics and energy source in the central 10pc of this system. We detect high velocity outflowing motions in this region, of up to 400 km/s. This is in sharp contrast to the expected speed for purely gravitational collapse at the distance of this source, estimated to be only 50-100 km/s. It is likely that these high-velocity motions are due to the interaction between the molecular gas and a yet-to-be-detected counter-rotating molecular gas component, as previously proposed for the situation in the Milky Way based on other lines (Bronfman et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).

This work presents the first direct detection of infrared radiation from the region around giant planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. This is done using L-band (3.78-3.84 μm) spectroscopy, which has not been widely used for planet detection because it is more difficult to observe from space than other bands, and does not provide the same level of detail as shorter wavelengths. Using the Infrared Telescope on board the Spitzer Space Observatory, we obtained high-quality spectroscopy of two nearby stars, named Tucana and Beta Pictoris, that are members of the moving groups corresponding to their age. We observed each star in the L  (3.74-3.81 μm) and L  (3.84-3.94 μm) water vapor filters, which are extremely sensitive to reflected infrared radiation from planets in the habitable zone of these stars. No planets were detected in these observations, placing upper limits on the planetary water abundance of 1.2×10−5 and 1.3×10−5 for the Tucana and Beta Pictoris systems, respectively.

Analysis of optical and near-infrared data from multiple telescopes have revealed an overdensity of Yellow-Green (YG) stars with respect to the diffuse background population, a distribution consistent with that of a spherical Gaussian, and a projected size of 1.6 x 1.3 kpc (2.2 x 1.7 Mpc), corresponding to 0.14% of the diameter of the Orion Arm. This overdensity is at least partially corroborated by weak optical emission from dust, as measured by the *Spitzer Space Telescope, and is consistent with infrared spectroscopic surveys showing a high number density of young, hot, and massive stars. The most massive stars, with a likely initial mass of several hundred solar masses, have an implied present formation mass of several thousand solar masses if they have starved-looking disks and are considered to be in the main sequence phase. The derived mass and size are also consistent with stellar-mass-threshold predictions for formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), an expected signature of active supermassive black hole growth at the center of the cluster. The age and masses of the stellar populations are also consistent with IMBH formation via seeds from the remnants of very massive stars, although higher chance of coalescence for lower mass seeds cannot be ruled out. A peculiar velocity of the cluster with respect to the local standard of rest, measured from the motion of bright member stars, and the mass projected along the line-of-sight, both suggest the cluster may not be virialized. If a supermassive black hole is present, as suggested by its likely formation via intermediate-mass black hole seeds or very massive star remnants, the observed properties of the cluster systematically depart from those expected for a classical star cluster. This intriguing object suggests that either massive seeds for IMBHs could have formed outside of clusters, and grown via accretion, or there is more than one mode of IMBH formation.

In this work, we investigate the possibility that the dust in the middle ring is dynamically linked to the binary system, as suggested by White et al. (2004). We use ALMA observations of the CO v = 2-1 line at a spatial resolution of 12.8 x 4.8 AU to estimate the radial velocity dispersion of the gas within the ring. We find that the dust and gas kinematics are consistent with each other within the errors, suggesting that the dust and gas in the ring are dynamically coupled. Based on the Toomre parameter and gravitational stability criteria, the observed ring radius and temperature are consistent with a population of planetesimals whose ephemeris is maintained by an external perturber. We investigate whether the outer ring is externally disturbed by calculating the mutual gravitational interaction between the two rings and find that the observed offset between the dust peaks is insufficient to maintain the observed ring structure. However, if the GG Tau system has an additional component in a nearly counter-clockwise orbit with a semi-major axis of 210 AU and a current projected separation of 20 AU, we find that the system is unstable over timescales of 100 Myr.

In recent years, high-resolution N-body simulations have advanced to the point of enabling the gravitational clustering of dark matter to be reproduced directly, allowing the construction of halo PDFs at much higher mass and spatial resolution. These have provided new insights into the process of halo assembly, allowing the growth of substructure within each halo to be analysed and the influence of environment on halo properties to be investigated. Although the evolution of halo mass function is generally consistent with a predicted scale-free form at the high-mass end, with significant deviations seen only at the low- and high-mass ends, the PDFs exhibit more complex behaviour, with significant differences between individual simulations, and a dependence on time and environment. In this paper we use the large-volume (&gt;8.5 billion h^{-1} Mpc^3), intermediate-resolution (particle mass &lt; 8.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M &sol;) Millennium-II simulation to investigate the evolution of the PDFs of the concentration, spin and orbital kinetic energy of dark matter haloes across four environments: clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. We also examine the effects of subhalo accretion, disruptions and mergers on these properties. The mass dependence of these distributions evolves significantly with time, and environment has a significant impact on the distribution at fixed time. In general, the haloes in sheets and filaments have more concentrated mass distributions than their cluster or void counterparts at all epochs. These differences are reflected in their associated mass functions, with the filament clusters being the most massive and most dynamically evolved structures, while voids are the most overdense regions in the universe and thus mark the sites of recent and future structure formation. The evolution of these distributions with time and environment therefore appears to be related to the hierarchical growth of structure. The spin and orbital kinetic energy also exhibit significant differences between environments, with the spin magnitude having a near-universal evolution, irrespective of environment or redshift, while the orbital kinetic energy exhibits different behaviours, with its distribution shifting to lower values in more evolved environments. This corresponds to the hierarchical buildup of structure in sheets and filaments, which forms at relatively late times, leading to an accumulation of material in the central regions, as well as a reduction in substructure. The properties of haloes in clusters are largely set by their major mergers since z &gt; 2, leaving them with short orbital times and low orbital kinetic energy. Conversely, the evolution of void haloes is more complex, with a mixture of processes at work.

The IRS data were reduced using a modified version of the S11 script and the MIPS data were reduced using the MIPS Data Reduction Guide version 8.0. In this work we combine all of the archival Spitzer observations of NGC 6052 in order to carry out a detailed analysis of the galaxy s spectral energy distribution (SED). We first construct a broadband SED from the optical to the mid-infrared. This is then used to fit a dust torus model to the infrared data. The model consists of a central BlackBody source modified by a fixed radial density distribution of dust grains in an otherwise empty spheroid. The resulting best-fit model parameters indicate that NGC 6052 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with an estimated power of 1051 W and a distance of 95.2 billion light years. The AGN contributes 74% of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy and the host galaxy contributes 23% (11% of the total infrared luminosity). We also examine the spatial distribution of the warm (50-125 K) and hot (125-540 K) dust, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and use these results to assess the thermal balance of the galaxy. We find that the hot dust is concentrated in a circumnuclear ring with a radius of 3.2 pc. The inner and outer radii of the cool dust are found to be 14 pc and 50 pc, respectively. The total dust mass is estimated to be 2.3 x 10-5 M⊙. The PAH luminosity is 5.5 x 10-8 L⊙ and the star-formation rate is 1.2 M⊙/year. The relative strengths of the PAH bands indicate that the predominant energy source heating the dust is star-formation, rather than the AGN. We also examine the ionized gas component of the galaxy, finding that it contributes 1% of the total infrared luminosity. We estimate that the star-formation rate in the ring is 235 M⊙/year.

The resulting best - fitting model variables suggest that NGC 6052 has an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) with an estimated power of 1051 W and a distance of 95 . 2 billion light years .The AGN adds 74 % of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy and the target galaxy provides 23 % ( 11 % of the total infrared luminosity ) . We additionally analyze the spatial distribution of the cool ( 50 - 125 K ) and hot ( 125 - 540 K ) dust , as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and use these results to examine the thermal balance of the universe .We see that the hot dust is concentrated in a circumnuclear circle with a diameter of 3 . 2 pc . The outer and outer radii of the cool dust are found to be 14 pc and 50 pc , respectively .The total dust mass is reported to be 2 . 3 x 10 - 5 [UNK] . The PAH luminosity is 5 . 5 x 10 - 8 [UNK] and the star - formation rate is 1 . 2 [UNK] / year .The relative strengths of the PAH groups indicate that the main energy source heating the dust is star - formation , rather than the AGN . We additionally analyze the ionized gas component of the galaxy , finding that it adds 1 % of the total infrared luminosity .We estimate that the star - formation rate in the ring is 235 [UNK] / year . We undergo a analysis of the spectral line energy distribution to determine the distribution of dense gas in the ring .We estimate the gas mass to be 1 . 1 x 10 - 4 [UNK] .

        "original_text": "Recently, the existence of planets around the star 14 Herculis has been announced. This star is located in the constellation Hercules at a distance of 20.7 light years from the Earth. The existence of 14 Her planets make this system the seventh closest system to the Earth. Since the discovery of the planets around 14 Herculis was announced, several studies have been carried out in order to confirm their physical and orbital characteristics. 14 Her planets can be categorized into three groups according to their sizes. The planets in the inner group have semi-major axes between 0.13 and 0.36 astronomical units, the planets in the middle group have semi-major axes between 0.36 and 0.7 astronomical units, and the planets in the outer group have semi-major axes greater than 0.7 astronomical units. Planets in the inner and outer groups have minimal masses between 7 and 22 Earth masses, whereas the mass of the planets in the middle group is between 22 and 55 Earth masses. In this study, we performed numerical simulations to characterize the dynamical evolution of the 14 Her planets. We show that, because of their relatively short periods and the proximity of the outermost planet in the system to their star, the 14 Her planets might have formed in multiple blocks and were unable to move further away from the star due to planet-planet scattering. Moreover, we predict the existence of a fourth outer planet in the system with a minimal mass of 9 Earth masses. However, further precise radial velocity measurements are required in order to confirm the existence of this planet and to characterize its orbit. This study was performed as part of the Dynamical Analysis of Planetary Systems (DAPS) network, which was designed to characterize the long-term dynamical evolution of planetary systems.

The model exhibits a quantum phase transition from a normal phase to a cooperative phase as the coupling strength exceeds a critical value. As an exactly solvable model, the Dicke model has been extensively studied and is well understood, but its extension to an N-qubit system with general multipolar interactions is significantly less well-understood. In particular, such general multipolar interactions are found to lead to rich quantum phases beyond the simple cooperative phase of the Dicke model, including a subradiant phase with non- vanishing expectation values of the excitation number operator and a Luttinger liquid phase with continuously varying correlation functions. Here, we present a method to characterize these phases, with an emphasis on the identification of the Luttinger liquid phase, based on the parafermionic quantum field theory of Abanov and Wiegmann.

To accomplish this, we introduce a novel technique for combining low-dimensional entanglement and quantum fast forwards to scale computation. Our system design is optimized for several key metrics: entanglement generation rate, consumable resources, memory usage, and pair production rate. The entanglement is generated between lightmatter qubits in a quantum frequency quadpter, distillation of the shared entanglement is accomplished in parallel on a cluster of nearby quantum computers, and a quantum signal reconstruction step is completed at a metropolitan node. Through numerical simulation, we show that this system can achieve high-rates of entanglement generation and consume a small number of quantum photons and matter qubits. Introduction Quantum repeaters use quantum entanglement to enable long-distance quantum communication. Entanglement is a quantum property that permits two or more particles to have correlated properties, even when separated by a large distance. Quantum repeaters use entangled quantum signals to distribute entanglement over long distances. Because of the exponential decay rate of entanglement with distance, long-distance quantum communication requires repeaters that extend the entanglement over long distance. Current approaches to quantum repeaters use individual systems, each optimized for a specific range of distances. Systems optimized for short distances, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through detection of either quantum side-channels or modification of qubits in transmission. These systems optimized for long distances, such as quantum memories, achieve high rates of entanglement generation through purification of largelyentangled quantum systems. Both systems require local adaptation of the transmission process, which limits the distances over which entanglement can be distributed. In this paper, we present a quantum repeater architecture that combines features from these optimized systems for short and long distances. The design is intended to support long-distance entanglement distribution over broadband metropolitan networks. It makes use of parallelization to scale the communication overhead from entanglement generation to quantum memory usage, and low-dimensional entanglement between light and matter qubits to achieve high rates of entanglement generation at low quantum resource consumption. Entanglement generation is facilitated by using light-matter entanglement, where matter qubits interact with light in quantum frequency quadpters (QFQs). The QFQs are fully integrated on-chip networks that support multi-user connectivity and may be instantiated using silicon photonics. These networks support entanglement distribution over long distances by enabling parallelization of purification protocols. However, the purification rates in previous approaches were limited by the need to localize the entanglement generation to specific purification registers. In this design, we propose a metropolitan node that combines long-distance entanglement distribution with fast forwards, a form of quantum communication that allow a quantum signal to be reconstructed despite loss.

We derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that includes the Jaynes-Cummings, Tavis-Cummings, and dipole couplings. Numerical simulations of quantum Rabi, Dicke, and Landau-Zener models are performed to illustrate the QED regime. This low-energy QED description facilitates a controlled analysis of qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels. The predicted dispersive decay and dephasing rates are consistent with recent experiments. Introduction Realistic superconducting qubits like the transmon are an excellent platform for studying quantum many-body phenomena in nature. In particular, their highly tunable nature allows for an exquisite control of both system- and bath- dephasing processes. This exquisite control, however, has become an asset that now poses a challenge for sufficiently understanding and describing the underlying physical mechanisms. In this paper, we develop a detailed quantum electrodynamical (QED) description of interactions between realistic superconducting qubits and microwave radiation. The derivation is based on a high-fidelity derivation of the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian in  1 . Unlike other derivations in the literature, our starting point is a fully calibrated transmon model, that is, a model with the complete experimental control settings encoded. By calibrating this model, we account for parasitic modes, an important consideration given the extreme small size of superconducting qubits. A crucial result of this derivation is an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that includes the Jaynes-Cummings, Tavis-Cummings, and dipole couplings. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we obtain analytical expressions for qubit-microwave coupling strengths and microwave frequency offsets relative to the qubit levels. These analytical expressions facilitate a systematic understanding and controlled analysis of qubit-microwave interactions for any given experimental system setup. The low-energy QED description enables a quantitative comparison with experiment and an assessment of control errors and residual non-QED interactions. Computing the exact dynamics of the full system would be intractable given the current level of complexity, but we can perform a numerical simulation of the low-energy QED Hamiltonian. Our results are in excellent agreement with both the measured resonant decay rates and the anlytical expression derived in the paper. In addition, our simulations explain the emergence of avoided level crossings in the system. This explanation, which is not accounted for in the QED model, is a non-Markovian dressing of the qubit levels by the non-perturbative bath induced by spontaneous emission.

The paper presents a general framework for building a superconducting theory in a magnetic field. Such theory should be able to describe the superconductor below the critical temperature, as well as the magnetic materials with an Abrikosov vortices lattice at zero temperature. The starting point of the theory is to assume that the order parameter is a complex field that depends on both space and time. In this way, all the degrees of freedom associated with the magnetic field are included into the theory and the coexistence of superconductor and magnetic flux states can be described. Due to the complex nature of the order parameter, one needs to include many degrees of freedom to fully describe the superconducting state. To do so, one needs to resort to a many-body expansion of the free energy. For small coupling between the order parameter and the magnetic field, a local approximation is sufficient to capture the main physical mechanism. This is done by treating the superconducting and magnetic materials on equal footings by introducing a new auxiliary field into the free energy functional. The theory is applied to describe superconductivity in a magnetic field at the nanometer scale. In this regime, the London theory cannot be applied and a fully quantum mechanical treatment is required.

Due to their high inward flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, the H<--->H2 reaction became rapidly inhibited, and subsequent H2 formation was suppressed. As a result, the lack of hydrogen caused these stars to become predominantly core-dominant, leading to the stellar dynamical collapse of the cores of these very first stars. Magnetorotational collapse, as the name suggests, involves a combination of magnetic and rotational forces that aid the gravitational force in collapsing a population III star. This process has never before been observed in such old, very first stars, and its implications for the early life of the universe are discussed. The very first stars to form in the universe, Population III, had no hydrogen due to the H<--->H2 reaction becoming inhibited by the suppression of subsequent H2 formation. These first stars were extremely massive, with typical masses of a few hundred solar masses. Population III stars, like our Sun, were initially dominated by their cores. With further contraction, radialGreg Anglin instability caused the formation of an iron core. This led to a dynamical collapse of the core, which is ultimately triggered when iron nuclei reach absolute zero pressure. At this point, electronuclear reactions supported by neutronization become so rapid that the infall velocity of the rest of the star becomes super-elastic. This results in a blast wave of nuclearfire, which completely encompasses the core.

In this work we present a new analysis technique based on the distribution of distances between consecutive surface detector elements, that allows the measurement of parameters that are more sensitive to the nature and the intensity of the primary particle than the traditional lateral distribution function. We apply this method to characterize the suppression of cosmic ray flux above the so-called GZK energy and compare the results with previous measurements using traditional parameterizations. We also study the sensitivity to changes in the content of primary cosmic rays and in the chemical composition by using a new parameter, the spectral rigidity, which is a measure of the energy separation between adjacent energy levels of a given atom or nucleus. We find that the behavior of the measured composition-sensitive parameters above the GZK cutoff is in agreement with the interpretation of this feature as a result of the interaction of high energy cosmic rays with the photon background, supporting the idea that the latter is composed mostly of atomic < C < /sub > 4 </sub> and < Si > nuclei.",

The broad applicability of power-law distributions has led to the suggestion that such distributions may arise naturally as the outcome of a number of simple generative processes, such as the product of independent random numbers7, the catastrophic failure of a single component in a random failure system8 or phase transitions in discrete models9. However, it has also been suggested that power-law distributions may result from the superposition of a large number of more common distributions10, the simple permuation of a single common distribution11 or a logarithmic distribution12. Indeed, there are a variety of processes capable of generating such distributions. For example, the superposition of a large number of common distributions may generate a distribution with a power-law tail13. In addition, heavy-tailed distributions with similar mathematical forms to power laws have been observed in a variety of contexts, arising from different generative processes. For example, the late stages of a logarithmic distribution may be similar in appearance to a power law14, and it has been suggested that the size distribution of computer files may be consistent with a power law, even though this is often attributed to finite size effects15. Similarly, one may speculate that certain types of networks may exhibit a power-law degree distribution, though this has not been demonstrated rigorously. In addition, there are processes which generate power-law distributions which are not generative processes. For example, the removal of nodes from a network with a power-law degree distribution may result in the removal of nodes with degree distributions similar to a power law16. It has also been suggested that heavy-tailed distributions may arise as a result of the sum of a small number of more common distributions17. For example, a truncated power law may arise as the result of a superposition of common distributions18. In this case, it is interesting to note that there are many examples of power-law distributions which arise as a result of a small number of generative processes. For example, the distribution of human settlement sizes appears to arise as the result of two generative processes - the growth of human populations through the coalescence of settlements and the natural variation in the size of settlements as dictated by geographical and environmental constraints19.",

        "original_text": "Interstellar dust is a trace component of matter in galaxies, which is mostly concentrated in dusty regions such as spiral arms and nuclei. There are two contradictory views on the origin of interstellar dust: one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds, supernovae or planetary nebulae; the other is that the dust is continuously produced in regions of recent star formation. To solve this problem, a third model was proposed, according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then brought into galaxies by collisions of large bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or dwarf galaxies. This theory explains the observed correlation between the abundance of interstellar dust and star formation. The presence of dust affects the development of new generations of stars and galaxies, and their properties. Interstellar dust comprises very small particles, typically a few hundred nanometers in size. Optical observations in the visual and infrared regions are the most suitable for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust. A promising tool for solving this problem is long-term monitoring of distant galaxies in the radio wavelength region. The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths depends strongly on the distribution of dust in galaxies. The analysis of the variation of the spectral index over a long period of time (several decades) makes it possible to determine the amount and distribution of interstellar dust in a galaxy. The results of long-term observations of the dust content in a number of galaxies, made using the 100-m and the 45-m radio telescopes of the MPIfR in Effelsberg, the 1.2-meter and the 0.7-meter telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the APEX Telescope, the IRAM 30-m and the SEST 20-m radio telescopes in Chile, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory in Finland, and other facilities have shown that the production and evolution of dust in a galaxy is associated with certain properties of this galaxy. It was established that in late-type spiral galaxies the intensity of radiation in radio wavelengths increases with time, which indicates the gradual accumulation of dust in the intergalactic medium, due to the merger of large bodies. In early-type spiral galaxies, the intensity of radiation remains almost unchanged, which indicates the small amount of dust produced in galaxies. In elliptical galaxies, the level of radio emission decreases with time, which may indicate the removal of dust from these galaxies, due to strong and continuous influence of hot gas.",

There are two contradictory perspectives on the origin of interstellar dust : one is that the dust is formed in stellar atmospheres and ejected via stellar winds , supernovae or planetary nebulae ; the other is that the dust is constantly produced in areas of recent star formation .To solve this question , a third model was suggested , according to which dust is formed in the intergalactic medium and is then sent into galaxies by collisions of large bodies , such as asteroids , comets , or dwarf stars . This theory presents the seen correlation between the quantity of interstellar dust and galaxy formation .The presence of dust impacts the development of new generations of stars and galaxies , and their characteristics . Interstellar dust contains very small particles , generally a few hundred nanometers in length .Optical studies in the visual and infrared zones are the most suited for studying the distribution and dynamics of interstellar dust . A good tool for solving this question is full - term surveillance of distant galaxies in the radio spectral region .The evolution of the spectral indices of the radiation intensity in radio wavelengths relies highly on the distribution of dust in galaxies .

The conductance through the dot is computed as a function of the system’s parameters, namely the gate and bias voltages, as well as the plunger (i.e., orbital) number of the dot. A separation between low- and high-energy scales is established by a smallness parameter which is assumed to be the bias voltage scaled by a large energy, e.g., the plunger energy. Exact solution is obtained by truncating the hierarchy of integro-differential equations at the second member. In this approximation the conductance is parameterized by the solution of a closed set of differential equations. Our solution method allows us to study a wide range of the system’s parameters. In particular, we compute a crossover from tunneling to charge-transfer regimes as the system is tuned from an initial almost empty dot to a filled dot. Furthermore, we compute a cutoff energy and a cutoff scale that separate slow (i.e., flowing with the system’s parameters) from fast (i.e., independent) scales in the system.

In particular, the weak force is mediated by the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs boson, yet the interactions of these particles are described by a single coupling constant, coupling the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces together. The renormalization group (RG) has told us that this single coupling constant must evolve from a high energy value ofunity at high energy scales. By introducing an additional symmetry between the strong and electroweak forces, and a singlet scalar field under both, we can naturally give the coupling constant of the weak force a value less than that of the strong coupling constant, without the presence of any new particles. This symmetry breaking is achieved through the vev of the Higgs field, which is what gives the particles their masses. This scalar field, and the corresponding symmetry breaking, is called the Higgs mechanism. Because the Higgs has no particular charge, it can couple to both the weak bosons and the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism can suppress the unwanted interaction between the electron and the photon. This results in the cancellation of the tree-level Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) and the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixing. By introducing a small explicit symmetry-breaking term, we can obtain a Higgs boson with suitably-vanished interactions with the electron and quark, while preserving the successful unification of the electroweak and strong forces described above. The full theory must also reproduce the correct results for nuclear physics and scattering processes.

However, if the potential of the scalar field has a lower bound, the contribution of the fluctuations of this field to the gravitational waves is not effective. In this work, we study the maximal amount of gravitational waves generated in the curvaton scenario, taking into account the effects of the effective speed of gravity during inflation. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves in the curvaton scenario is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. We show that this result does not change even if the potential of the scalar field has an upper bound. In this work, we consider the case of two scalar fields: the real inflaton field and the complex curvaton field. The complex curvaton field determines the fluctuation of the number density of dark matter, while the real inflaton field determines the variation of the expansion rate of the universe. During the inflaton oscillation, the speed of gravity is nearly equal to the light speed, while it is slower than the light speed during the period of the complex inflaton field evolution. Thus, the fluctuation of the scalar field determining the number density of dark matter contributes to the gravitational waves with the parameter Omega_GW, which is related to the speed of the gravity. We find that the maximal amount of gravitational waves is equal to the general relativity value, Omega_GW=1. In addition, we study the perturbation of the gravitational wave during the sub-Hubble scales. We find that the perturbation of the gravitational wave is dependent on the effective speed of gravity during inflation. If the effective speed of gravity is equal to the light speed, then the amplitude of the perturbation of the gravitational wave is inversely proportional to the square of the effective speed of gravity. This result has an upper limit, which is 1/3 for the case of two-field models and 1/7 for the case of multi-field models.

In this paper, we report an unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior in a non-magnetic material, TiO2. When Ti atoms are removed from the TiO2 crystal lattice (specifically the Ti4+ sites), the crystal structure evolves to anatase type and acquires a net magnetic moment, which is found to be persistent above room temperature. This Ti4+ disorder induced magnetism (TDIM) has been observed in a number of materials such as TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 thin films and nanotubes. We hope that our work will stimulate more research activities in this field and motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations on this interesting problem. In the supplementary material, authors have provided more experimental data and also some hints for the theoretical explanation of TDIM. First-principles calculations show that Ti4+ disorder, on substitution of O2- anions for TiO2- anatase, leads to a net ferromagnetic moment. In addition, our experimental studies indicate the persistence of this moment up to at least 300 K. These observations are in contrast to previous reports of anatase type TiO2 being nonmagnetic. Various mechanisms for the persistence of this net moment are explored. While substantial ionic coupling in Ti4+ sites is necessary to explain the observed moment, substantial spin-orbit coupling is required to explain the observed moment value. The theoretically predicted ordering temperature of this moment is consistent with experimental results. Our work demonstrates that Ti4+ disorder is an overlooked mechanism to induce ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials. We have provided possible evidences to support the hypothesis that Ti4+ disorder accounts for the persistent ferromagnetism observed in a number of materials. Since Ti4+ disorder has been observed in a number of anatase type TiO2 samples, our work raises the possibility of persistent ferromagnetism in TiO2 based materials and related systems. This study was motivated by the recent report of persistent ferromagnetism in Ti4+-disordered TiO2. 1  While much research has been devoted to understand the origin of ferromagnetism in metals, understanding ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials is still an active area of research. TiO2, which is used as a semiconductor in many devices, is nonmagnetic. However, recent work has demonstrated that certain forms of TiO2 can be ferromagnetic. 2,3  Since ferromagnetism has been observed in a number of Ti4+-disordered materials, understanding the origin of ferromagnetism in TiO2 is of both fundamental and applied interest.

They are key to how galaxies and clusters obtain most of their energy and momentum. The formation of astrophysical jets is still a mystery, but various theoretical models have been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that magnetic fields are important in generating, collimating, and sustaining astrophysical jets. In this paper we study the resonant coupling between the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the magnetosonic wave in a sheared, relativistic plasma, with special emphasis on the astrophysical systems in which this process may take place. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of general relativity. We find that in these systems the resonant mechanism can efficiently channel energy from the shear into the fast Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. For simplicity we consider a system consisting of a sheared plasma, moving with a Lorentz factor γ in a quasi-neutral plasma with an external magnetic field B0 along the y-direction. We study the modes that are possible when the linear propagation speed of the magnetosonic wave is equal to the phase speed of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The most unstable mode has a short wavelength in the y-direction and a non-zero phase speed in the x- and z-directions. The growth rate of the most unstable mode is proportional to the square of the fluid vorticity in the y-direction, which means the instability is most efficient for differentially rotating systems. However, the most unstable mode also depends on the ratio of the shear to the sound speed, γShc, and increases with γShc, meaning that the stronger the shear, the more efficient the mode. We also study the stability of this most unstable mode against non-linear effects. When the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave becomes comparable to the amplitude of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, the two waves interact non-linearly and the most unstable mode evolves into a stable shock wave with smooth contact surfaces. We conclude that the resonant coupling between Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetosonic waves may have an important impact on astrophysical jets, which makes it an important area for future study. The resonant coupling discussed here could also be important in microquasars, the envirnment of black hole systems like SS 433, where a pair of stars orbiting each other eject high-energy jets. The stars are in nearly circular orbits, but the jets are highly relativistic and tend to ejection in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. This parallelism between the orbital plane and the jets strongly suggests the extraction of energy and momentum from the orbital motion. The extraction of energy and momentum from a shearing relativistic flow may provide a new mechanism for this parallelism. Resonant amplification of Kelvin-Helmholtz and magnetos",

It is composed of a predominantly dipolar component generated by the motion of inner core, and a fluctuating component generated by atmospheric and solar processes. The amplitude of the fluctuating component decreases rapidly with distance from the magnetic north and requires the integration of solar input and atmospheric response to accurately determine its amplitude and dipole moment at Earth’s surface. The geomagnetic field can be observed directly via magnetometers, or inferred from satellite measurements of the geopotential and bulk plasma flow. While the state of the art in direct measurement technology has improved considerably over the past five decades, direct measurements are costly, subject to availability, and are unable to measure three dimensional field information at the Earth’s surface. For this reason, geophysical models have been coupled to magnetic field data assimilation in order to determine the 3D field amplitude and dipole moment at the surface. This paper reviews some of the specific advances made in variational data assimilation, a recently developed technique for the assimilation of indirect observation data in order to improve the estimation of the state of a dynamical system. The variational method is cast as a constrained optimization problem in the J-subproblem and D-subproblem, where J and D denote the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through the assimilation of magnetic field data from a single location on Earth to a nonlinear, high-dimensional, and sparse MHD model. The application of variational assimilation to the magnetic field is a promising new direction for improving the accuracy of geophysical models and, in the long term, improving our understanding of the dynamo process that generates the Earth’s magnetic field.",

A popular solvent model for such systems is dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), which combines simple mechanics with pairwise screened interaction between particles. Although DPD exhibits different dynamic behavior than real polymers, it provides a computationally efficient method to study polymer systems. Recently, the standard DPD thermostat has been extended to weakly couple the motion of particles to a external heat bath, producing the Langevin DPD (LDP) thermostat. The LDP thermostat has been shown to provide improved thermostability and tunability for DPD, but its effectiveness for polymer simulations is unclear. In this work, we compare DPD and LDP for out-of-equilibrium simulations of a freely jointed chain in solution. Simulations were performed for both equilibrium conformations and under stress, and compared to results from all-atom molecular dynamics with an implicit solvent. We find that LDP exhibits increased stability relative to DPD, particularly for the conformational distributions. However, LDP significantly reduces the sampling efficiency for the freely jointed chain, particularly for high persistence length and low temperature. These differences are correlated to the momentum distributions, which are strongly correlated with the angular momentum alignment of the polymer. Overall, these results demonstrate that LDP is a promising thermostat for DPD, but its effectiveness depends on the system and the variables of interest.",

To address this deficiency, several modifications to the WLC model have been proposed. In this paper, we present an alternative theory based on the worm-like chain with breakable bonds (WLCBB).

Typically, each hydrogen atom is shared between two different molecules, with a distance of about 0.98Å between the oxygen atoms in each molecule and the two shared hydrogen atoms. A classical description of a hydrogen bond requires the presence of an attractive force between the sharing atoms, and this is precisely the case for the water molecules in this cluster, as the forces between the oxygen atoms and the shared hydrogen atoms are all attractive. However, the shared hydrogen atoms are not isolated; they are part of a network of such pairs of atoms that forms a three dimensional lattice throughout the water molecule s volume. This lattice weakens the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the individual water molecules. The amount of the weakening depends on the particular orientation of the water molecules in the cluster, but if the lattice is assumed to extend uniformly throughout the cluster, the force between the shared hydrogen atoms is found to be one-third of the force between the oxygen atoms in the water molecules. This weakening of the hydrogen bonds has important implications for the behavior of water in different systems",

One of them is based on the see-saw mechanism which uses particles around the Grand Unification scale (GUT scale) to provide small masses to the standard model (SM) neutrinos. We present an extension of the see-saw mechanism based on the introduction of several additional symmetries. This leads to a realization of the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that in the framework of this new class of models, contrary to the original see-saw mechanism, one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos can have a very large mass, even above the TeV scale. This implies the existence of a distinguished GeV-TeV collider channel for this neutrino, making this model testable in the near future. We present the realistic realization of this class of models with both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The deviation from unitarity of the first column of the PMNS matrix is used to explain the normal hierarchy, while the deviation from zero in the first row of the mixing matrix explains the inverted hierarchy. This model can be tested by the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We present the one-loop contribution of the lightest active neutrino and the heaviest right-handed neutrino to this magnetic moment. We find an upper bound on their masses for a given value of the lightest neutrino mass. This model can be considered as an example of an unbalanced See-Saw mechanism, where the violation of the conservation of one or several of the additional symmetries leads to the presence of massless and/or very massive particles. This model has some other interesting phenomenological implications, in particular the existence of keV sterile neutrinos. We show that this model leads to the observed enhancement of the Higgs decay to a pair of muons, presented at the Moriond EW session as an excess. Massive and massless neutrinos were hypothesized in the 60s in order to explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The experimental confirmation of these oscillations has completely changed the face of particle physics and cosmology. The standard mechanism to explain these oscillations is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix through theDirac theory of the neutrino, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) theory of the photon and the Fermi theory of the electron.

Several key issues that must be overcome to build a biological molecular computer are also discussed. BioBrick assembly, logic gates, sensors, computers, robots and networks could all be built from bacterial cells. An essential part of this technology is the use of reliable methods of intracellular synthesis and assembly. A prime requirement in this respect is that the DNA templates employed in the construction of these molecular systems be obtained intracellularly. Current methods based on in vitro transcription or PCR amplification of DNA templates for direct biosynthesis are generally unreliable. We believe that the cell itself, by providing an environment with suitable pH, temperature and salt concentrations, and protected from direct physical injury, could serve as an ideal host for the biosynthesis of DNA. Theory suggests that significant barriers to intracellular DNA synthesis include the thermal stability of DNA in bacterial cells (which favors nascent DNA strands in their natural double-stranded form), cell membrane instability (which prevents larger DNA pieces from escaping the cell once transcription begins), and nuclease attack (which degrades DNA strands). In order to solve these problems, we have designed synthetic DNA structures with optimized thermal and membrane properties. In addition, we have identified potent nuclease-resistant DNA structures that have yet to be utilized in bio-nano fabrication. All of these DNA properties should facilitate the production and assembly of complex nanoscale structures from within bacterial cells. The versatile genetic information encoding capacity of DNA allows the digitalization of any signal for processing by the cell. An analogy may be made to the molecular computer that performs calculations by processing digital signals in a sequence of logic operations. These logic operations may be encoded in the form of DNA. As a result, any biochemical signal could be converted into a digital form suitable for processing by the cell. We are proposing the concept of digital biochemistry, where all biochemical signals are converted into digital form and processed by the cell.",

Such studies are of particular relevance to characterize the Degree of Chaos /thermalization achieved in these collisions. Our results are based on analyzing 1.7 million minimum-bias events from the PHOBOS experiment. We compare charged and neutral particle spectra, elliptic flow, and high transverse momentum particle production, covering a range of 15% centrality covering the most central to the most peripheral Au+Au collisions. We observe that particle production at forward rapidity is very well described by a quadratic function of the number of N-particles per unit of rapidity, where N=charged or neutral. These results are compared to hadronic models (PYTHIA, HIJING, AMPT), calculations from lattice QCD, and models from weakly coupled physics. Our data show the most detailed and strongest constraints on these models, and indicate the importance of specific aspects of the dynamics of these collisions to different aspects of the observed particle spectra. We quantify these aspects using a thermal-based model. This allows us to derive the thermal parameters for the system at the chemical and kinetic freezeouts. These are compared to predictions from ideal hadron gas and transport models at both constituent-quark level and hadronic level. We find that the kinetic freezeout parameter is more strongly constrained by the data, and we extract a conservative range of temperatures of 155 MeV<T<175 MeV. The preliminary results indicate that the hadron gas phase is short-lived, with a strong transition to a dense and hadronically collapsed medium at chemical freezeout. While both hard scattering and early phases of the nuclear collision appear to be consistent with being perturbative in nature, the strongly interacting final state is well described by a gluon plasma with moderate centrality-dependent temperatures of 155 MeV<T<175 MeV.",

Using data from X-shooter and other telescopes, we carried out a detailed study of this deep non-relativistic phase afterglow. From the X-shooter spectrum we derive a upper limit on the redshift of z < 0.1667. From the afterglow spectrum we measure the intrinsic reddening of A(V) = 0.47 ± 0.12 and a best-fit power-law slope of α = 1.7 ± 0.1, consistent with the value of α = 1.6 ± 0.1 measured by earlier studies. From the lightcurve we measure the half-opening angle of the jet to be θ = 17.8 ± 1.4 degrees. The prominent double-humped structure in the lightcurve, which has been interpreted as the signature of the passage of a jet through the surrounding medium, is also seen in our data, but only as a shallow deficit in the early afterglow lightcurve. We suggest that the shallow deficit is caused by an underestimated k-corrected host-galaxy magnitude in earlier studies, and suggest that the real structure in the lightcurve has a much smoother gradient. Finally, we consider the possibility that the optical/OIR afterglow may have been extinguished by dust in the galaxy itself. Using an empirical relation between IR-optical extinction and host-galaxy properties we find that this is possible, but that in this case the observed X-shooter spectrum is inconsistent with A(V) > 0.5.",

In systems with more modest outerplanet masses, strong tides raised on distant worlds can likewise shrink their orbital semi-major axes, but also damp the orbits. Here we show that if the innermost planet has a strong non-zero eccentricity, tides raised on the planet can cause eccentricity oscillations that drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and shrink the orbits. We carry out N-body simulations to validate this analytic theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism for shrinking the orbits of non-resonant planets in multipleplanet systems. We show that this process is efficient enough to explain the proximity of the Earth and Mars to the Sun, and could have contributed to the capture of planetesimals into Earth and Venus. The long-term behavior of hierarchical multiplanet systems is largely determined by the planets’ orbit and spin orientations. If the planets’ spins are misaligned with their orbital planes, the system can enter a Cassini state where the forced eccentricities of the planets damp out but their orbital angular momenta remain coupled. If, on the other hand, the planets’ spin axes are initially coplanar with their orbital planes, they can enter a Kozai state, in which the forced eccentricities oscillate with a period equal to a full cycle of eccentricity-raisingnode precession. During this time, the planets’ semi-major axes can shrink enough to cause a type II or type I migration depending on the characteristics of the adjacent planets. We demonstrate that the inclusion of even a single testparticle in apsidal motionward precession significantly increases the fraction of Kozai cycles completed before apsides align. Planetary systems that enter the Kozai state and subsequently undergo type II or type I migration may exhibit changes in their semimajor axes that are larger than observed in the Solar System. Here we demonstrate that, if one or more planets in such a system have sufficiently non-zero eccentricities, the Kozai cycles can drive eccentricities above the dynamically defined upper limit and drive the systems into collision.

Disordering transitions occur when a solid mixture transitions from a solid-like state to a liquid-like state, and peak effect is a phenomenon which occurs when the volume fraction of a solid mixture at the peaks of the density profile is greater than the average volume fraction of the mixture. These phenomena have both been observed in a wide range of material systems, including glass forming liquids, granular materials, and heterogeneous mixtures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect can be manipulated by altering the variance of the particle size distribution. We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations to model a binary mixture composed of particles with the same size but with different levels of variance. Through the use of radial distribution functions, we are able to demonstrate that disordering transitions and peak effect occur at lower volume fractions for systems with larger variances. Additionally, we observe an increased frequency of disordering transitions and peak effect as the variance of the particle size distribution increases, and we identify an approximate scaling relationship between these two quantities.

        "original_text": "Cosmic rays interact with gas to produce a range of chemical products. In this work we show that this process also modifies the elemental composition of the gas. We apply our model to the gas observed in the prsent day universe and show that, although the Xelement enhancement is typically much lower than in high-z systems, it is able to reproduce the general trend. Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement depends strongly on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. We apply our model to a broad range of spectra and show that different spectra lead to Xelement enhancements at the level of $10^{-3} - 1$ solar values at $z = 0$ for different metallicities at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This wide range of possible enhancements highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe. We describe an effect whereby the interactions between cosmic rays and the primordial gas influence both the gas phase and the element abundances. This has important implications for the potentiality of the gas to form structures and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time. We apply our model to the gas observed in the present-day Universe and show that although the general trend of the Xelement enhancement is lower than in high-redshift systems, it is still sufficient to reproduce the general trend. We also show that the evolution of the enhancement strongly depends on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. Our work highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe and the need to obtain a better understanding of processes occurring at low energies, such as the interaction between cosmic rays and the gas in the early universe. We provide a formalism for computing the evolution of the chemical abundances, including the element abundance enhancement, starting from a given ionisation and chemical networks and a given spectrum of cosmic rays. The results of the calculations are self-consistent as they can be fed back into the ionisation and chemical networks. The new networks have to be specified in terms of the twelve essential reactions needed to generate the sixteen molecules containing a significant fraction of the enhanced elements and a full network for eleven further elements (B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po).

Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement varies strongly on the form of the cosmic ray spectrum at low power .We use our model to a broad variety of spectra and suggest that different spectra contribute to Xelement enhancements at the level of $ 10 ^ { - 3 } - 1 $ solar values at $ z = 0 $ for different metallicities at $ 10 ^ { - 4 } $ solar values .

        "original_text": "The most ancient known stars in the universe are the blue straggler (BS) stars. These stars are thought to have formed after the matter in their host galaxies had expanded and cooled sufficiently for the main sequence lifetime of their constituent stars. These BS stars are thus iron-cored, helium-3 burning stars that have processed almost all of the original H and He into He-3. However, the most unusual characteristic of these stars is that they are (apparently) overwhelmingly massive, with more than 90% of the mass of their counterparts in the local universe. This has long been an enigma, given that the current standard theory of star formation predicts that such high mass stars are relatively uncommon, with simulations rarely yielding more than 5-10% massive stars. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Australian National University s 2.3-meter telescope have revealed a potentially revolutionary solution to this paradox. Using data from the Keck telescopes, we have observed nine blue straggler stars in three ultra-lithium-deficient stars, all of which show strongBe absorption in their spectra. This absorption is not present in equivalent measurements of normal stars and is extremely difficult to produce in any theoretical models. While the abundance ofBe must be very close to the half-life value in order to see absorption, it has been suggested that a standard freeze-out process cannot produce the observed amount ofBe, while a late-accreted s-process material is also ruled out. The observations presented here suggest a novel solution. It has previously been proposed that many BS stars may have been formed from accretion events, with material donated by a binary companion. As the most common element,Be is particularly good at absorbing optical radiation from a cool, low-mass companion, and thus its detection in the spectra of BS stars may be a signature of the process by which these stars were formed. We suggest that such accretion events are also likely to have been highly polluted with light elements such as Be. This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of star formation, and for models of binary star evolution. If substantial amounts ofBe can be synthesised in binary star systems, then these systems may represent an important site of nucleosynthesis in the early universe, and may provide a missing link between the populations of very low- and very high-mass stars in the galaxy population at early times.",

        "original_text": "In this paper, we argue that the finitary process algebraic approach to quantum mechanics has deep limitations in the domains where it has been applied, which are predominantly quantum mechanical. We propose a fundamental revision of the approach in which instead of using finitary processes to approximate physical quantities, we view physical quantities as variables, governed by a higher order differential equation. This approach admits a probabilistic interpretation, as the solutions to the corresponding stochastic partial differential equation, at least in special cases, reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics.

Over the last decade, an impressive amount of data has been obtained from B-factories and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and next-generation experiments at super-b-factories and the LHC upgrade are expected to collect samples in the range of 100 billion events. Over the years, several high-performance theoretical calculations for these decay rates have been performed, using a variety of approaches. Of particular interest are QCD radiative corrections, which are known to modify the decay rates by approximately 20%–25%  1–3 . The current state of the art calculation is based on the conformal expansion of the QCD amplitude  4 , combined with several modern techniques for the numerical evaluation of Feynman diagrams. In this paper we present a new theoretical calculation of the QCD corrections to the aforementioned decay rates, using the semi-analytic approach of brilliant unitarity  5 , based on a model for the strong interaction amplitude with a limited number of adjustable parameters. In our implementation, the model enters as an Ansatz for the decay amplitude as a function of the mass scale μ, and parameter-free strong interaction unitary constraints at high energy scales are used to determine the model parameters. We apply this approach to the calculation of the exclusive charmless B decay amplitudes into two-body hadronic final states, with a $D$ or $D_s$ meson, at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong interaction coupling constant α_s, and to all orders in the heavy quark expansion. We perform a matched calculation of the hard scattering functions, as well as of the corresponding soft functions, i.e., the propagator and vertex corrections. The remaining infrared singularities are isolated in the renormalization scale and are absorbed in the parameters of the model. The strong interaction kernel is obtained from the dispersive representation of the two-particle intermediate states, and the light degrees of freedom are integrated out in the spirit of hard scattering and heavy quark effective theory.",

Interacting proteins, which perform the signaling functions, are densely connected forming a complex signaling network. The signaling networks transmit and process information through a combination of multiple signaling pathways. Proteins, the signaling entities, transmit the information by changing their conformations via covalent modifications like phosphorylation. This paper presents a method for reconstructing signaling networks from proteomics data. This is a challenging problem due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the underlying signaling networks, the high sensitivity of signaling processes to variations in network topologies and parameters, and the large number of cells and proteomes typically required for statistically relevant data. The proposed method combines protein interaction networks with novel methodology for sparse representation of signaling networks in order to reconstruct signaling networks. The signaling networks are sparsely represented in a network of interacting proteins. Using the network of interacting proteins, we are able to reconstruct signaling networks while significantly reducing the number of interactions from potentially many thousands to a more manageable few. This allows us to study the signaling networks statistically and apply rigorous methods of network inference to reconstruct the networks. The signaling networks are tested against several simulation datasets and shown to accurately infer signaling networks. We also apply the method to MAPK signaling in yeast, where we reconstruct the signaling network using data from only five yeast strains. This allows us to study the effect of genetic variation on signaling processes. Finally, the signaling networks are shown to have strong predictive power across four mammals, with the mouse signaling network strongly predicting the human signaling network.",

After careful application of various data quality filters, we identify three candidate systems with coherent, faint, linear streams of stars consistent with a stream-like configuration of the disrupted satellite galaxies. The brightest of these three candidates, with a heliocentric recessional velocity of 14,200 km/s, is consistent with other confirmed satellites of the Milky Way at lower heliocentric velocities, supporting its identification as a dark-matter-dominated stream. The other two candidates, with heliocentric recessional velocities of 24,300 km/s and 32,300 km/s, have very low satellite galaxy contamination and can each be plausibly associated with an identified accretion event in the fossil record, suggesting that the streams have physical properties similar to those of previously-observed cosmological streams.

        "original_text": "Galaxy clusters have provided key astrophysical constraints over wide wavelength ranges from the radio to the X-ray. Yet despite this success, the process by which clusters assemble their mass remains a central question in modern astrophysics. Analytic theories of cluster assembly (e.g., @rs82) have long been superseded by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations (e.g., @nm04  @ds08 ), which have successfully reproduced key observables such as the cluster luminosity function and temperature function. However, the most massive clusters predicted by these simulations are somewhat under-abundant in comparison to the number of clusters in the real Universe (@k07  @l06 ; see also @s07 for a review). This “cosmic discordance problem” has inspired numerous explanations, including environmental filtering (@w84  @k84 ), cannibalism (@gm02), and massive cluster progenitors (@mm01). However, while these astrophysical theories have been successful in explaining the total amount of mass in clusters, they have not addressed the question of how individual clusters acquire their mass. Recently, we have found that the mass function of globular clusters in nearby galaxies may be directly correlated with the cumulative galaxy light in the cluster vicinity. In contrast to previous explanations that cluster mass is gradually acquired over time through mergers or environmental processes, we have shown that if most massive clusters formed instead by early dissolution of lower-mass systems, then there should be a negative correlation between the cluster mass and cluster light. Indeed, we have found that the data are consistent with the dissolution scenario, such that massive clusters are less common in the Universe and more readily dissolve. However, our results were based on small statistical samples. Here we report on a larger compilation of 22 clusters, for which we have homogeneously derived kinematics and presented a strong evidence for stellar evaporation in 10 of them. We estimate that stellar evaporation is a robust explanation for the dissolution of these clusters, and it naturally explains the mass-light correlation without any further dynamical processes. Thus, we suggest that the stellar evaporation may represent a new mechanism for regulating cluster mass, which has the potential to significantly influence the total amount of mass in clusters in cosmological simulations.",

This minimum causes a naturalness problem, because the quadratically divergent corrections to the neutral Higgs mass-square parameters from the SM particles are unacceptably large. The solution to this problem requires a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum with superpartner particles at accessible energies. A minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) contains two additional Higgs bosons, namely, the higgsinos and the heavy scalars, which appear in supersymmetry-breaking mass matrices. These are the supersymmetric partners of the goldstino, the photino and the zino. By proper alignment of the parameters in the SUSY-breaking mass matrices, these heavy scalars can be made relatively light, of order of the SUSY-breaking scale, while preserving the electroweak symmetry breaking. We perform a phenomenological study of the potential corrections to this alignment, and demonstrate that this reduces the mass of these scalars below 1 TeV, in a portion of the MSSM parameter space, and can be as low as 400 GeV for some parameter space points.

A recently introduced variable, the partial filling factor (PFF), is used to quantify the statistical spread of these generated sequences. PFF can be interpreted as a particularly fast indicator for assessing if a sequence contains a substantial amount of zeroes. This makes it well suited for identifying rare events in large amounts of data. In this work, the PFF is used to characterize the statistical properties of the so-called rare event sequences, i.e. the generated binary sequences with a particularly low number of zeroes. These may occur, e.g., in cryptography, if a random key is used for encrypting a long message, where a repetition of zeroes in the key could lead to a termination of the encryption algorithm. It is shown that the generated PFF fluctuations follow a zero-range process with a power-law tail in the size of the fluctuations. This corresponds to a strong spatial heterogeneity of the low-zero sequences and supports a growth mechanism of these sequences from a few deterministically produced seeds. For certain mixtures, it is found that rare event sequences happen with a non-vanishing frequency, which makes them of interest for cryptography.

        "original_text": "A new generation of spectrometer calibration techniques is presented that are based on optical frequency combs (OFCs). OFCs are highly coherent light sources that can be generated in various nonlinear optical cavities. By measuring the frequency of the reflected light from the target object, the OFC enables nanometer scale resolution and accurate measurement of optical spectra. This article describes an OFC-based calibration technique for optical spectrum analyzers. It consists of three key modules: a wavemeter based on Michelson interferometer, a tunable OFC, and an optical spectrum analyzer. The OFC is used to measure the target spectrum with high accuracy. In contrast to the typical spectrometer calibration using a commercial wavelength meter, the wavelength of OFC is directly measured rather than derived. Therefore, this technique has the same resolution but is more accurate and useful for many important applications in optical communications, ranging, and sensing. A block diagram of this OFC-based calibration technique is presented. This technique can measure the center wavelength, the bandwidth, and the intensity of the target spectrum with high precision. This makes it suitable for many important applications such as wavelength meter for optical communication networks, spectrum sensing with high resolution, and laser frequency and stability monitoring. The experimental results demonstrate that this OFC-based technique can measure center wavelength and bandwidth with a relative error less than 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The resolution of the intensity measurement is 0.2% FSWM (Full Width at Half Maximum).

Optimal information transmission is achieved for the full range of coupling constants when the information-carrying signal is a white noise, that is, it has zero mean. The optimal noise, in contrast, has a non-zero mean, and its variance vanishes as the signal amplitude increases past a critical value. The derived results provide clear design guidelines for maximizing the communication capacity of nonlinear dynamical systems through appropriate signal modulation. Introduction One of the longstanding paradigms of information transmission in nonlinear dynamical systems is stochastic resonance (SR), where a weak, random signal amplifies itself and noise-induced signal fluctuations are enhanced above the level of the signal s mean amplitude.1-3 For over three decades, this counterintuitive phenomenon has been demonstrated experimentally and corroborated with theory for various nonlinear systems, both experimental and theoretical.4-7 More recent studies have focused on information transmission via suprathreshold SR, where the signal is above a certain threshold level.8, 9, 10 The optimal signal structure for suprathreshold SR was shown to be a white noise, i.e., it has zero mean.11, 12 Here, we derive the optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission via suprathreshold SR. We focus on the archetypal diffusiely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, where the signal is the spiking activity of the neuronal model, and the noise represents background synaptic and neuronal noise.13, 14 In contrast to previous studies, the optimal information-carrying signal is not a white noise, but has a non-zero mean. Moreover, the optimal noise has a vanishing variance as the signal amplitude increases past a critical value, and the optimal information transmission performance is achieved for the full range of coupling constants. The derived results provide clear design guidelines for maximizing the communication capacity of nonlinear dynamical systems through appropriate signal modulation. Materials and methods We study information transmission via suprathreshold SR in the archetypal diffusiely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model,13, 14 which describes the dynamics of the membrane voltage of a neuron with the FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics,15 coupled to two linearly independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. The Langevin equations for the model read where {S t } are the amplitudes of the OU processes, {ν t } are Gaussian white noise terms, and ε is the coupling strength.

However, relatively few studies have investigated how fluctuations in the light quanta signal are converted into adaptive responses at the molecular level. Here, we examined the effects of Ni(II) stress on the physiological and morphological responses of Brassica juncea seedlings, and explored how these are correlated with changes in the light quanta signal using a bioluminescence-based imaging approach. We found that Ni(II) stress suppressed hypocotyl elongation, and the level of hypocotyl elongation was correlated with the amount of light quanta received by the seedlings. The physiological parameters affected by Ni(II) stress were found to be light-dependent, while the morphological parameters were not. Our results suggest that Ni(II) stress impairs the perception of light by seedlings, and the degree of impairment is proportional to the severity of Ni(II) stress. Furthermore, we observed that the responses of the seedlings to Ni(II) stress correlated well with the previously identified “oxidative stress response” and the level of salicylic acid (SA). We speculate that Ni(II) stress suppresses hypocotyl elongation by inhibiting the conversion of light quanta to visual signals, leading to an imbalance in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and SA, which have been shown to be involved in Ni(II) stress responses. Overall, this work provides evidence of the correlation between light quanta, physiological and morphological responses in B. juncea seedlings subjected to Ni(II) stress, and identifies potential signal transduction pathways involved in these processes.",

In fact, dualheap selection is faster than quick sort on some random distributions, suggesting that the unusual algorithm is more than just a trick.

In this note, we investigate the flavor changing current in the framework of a supersymmetric standard model. We demonstrate that the forward-backward asymmetry in the decays of the B mesons to X s and c quarks, with X denoting a charged lepton or a neutrino, is particularly sensitive to the effects of the flavor changing current. Using this asymmetry, we derive constraints on the flavor changing current coupling, which can be translated into constraints on SUSY parameters. We further show that combining these constraints with measurements of CP violation in B meson mixing, in addition to allowing for a more precise determination of the SUSY parameters, will yield crucial information on the structure of the flavor changing current and hence help us understand the mechanism of flavor violation. Finally, we propose to use the Belle II experiment at the superKEKB to improve the experimental constraints on top FCNC interactions.",

Methane gas is rarely found in its natural state. It usually occurs as single molecules or small clusters called clathrates. Solid methane occurs in two solid phases, the alpha (IV) and beta (IV) phases. The alpha phase, which is more stable at atmospheric pressure, is stable below 77K and at greater depths, while the beta phase is stable above 150K and at shallower depths. Because solid methane occurs in two solid phases with different structures, it presents an opportunity to investigate the relationship between crystal structure and dynamics. Neutron scattering can be used to investigate the crystal structure via the structure factor. The dynamic structure factor contains information about the intramolecular dynamics. We have developed a quantum molecular dynamics model for the dynamics of solid methane that includes key physics necessary for accurate modeling of the dynamic structure factor. We validate the model by calculating the dynamic structure factor of the alpha phase of solid methane and comparing it to previous inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. Our model could be used to further investigate the relationship between crystal structure and dynamics, and predict how dynamics vary between solid methane phases and how they vary with changing pressure or temperature.",

We find that, for a wide range of physically plausible parameters, these fields exist as stable configurations, rather than being plagued by magnetic instability. We also find that such fields modify the structure of neutron stars, and have impacts on their cooling behavior. Our results provide new insights into the nature of some magnetars, as well as offering new mechanisms for radio emission from these objects. Neutron stars are among the most exotic objects in the universe. They are leftover objects from the death of massive stars. They are as heavy as the moon but much more dense, being averages of several kilometers of matter packed into a volume of a few kilometers. Their interior, the so-called  nuclear sphere,  is rich in neutrons, almost half of the volume being comprised of neutrons held together with the strong force. This neutron matter is the most dense matter in the universe, similar in density to a large tumor on a human being. Surrounding the nuclear sphere is a  deep crust,  essentially a thin layer of partially degenerate neutron drip, and finally an outer layer of hydrogen and helium. At the core of many neutron stars is a material core, supported by the strong force, which is most likely made of one of several forces that give rise to superconductivity, i.e, Fermi, Coorbital, U(1) or colour superconductivity. Type II superconductivity occurs in metals at low temperatures. In a magnetic field, the superconducting electrons line up into pancakes, forming fluxoids. The resulting field is maximal at the mid-plane of the star and tapers off near the surface. If the total flux is an integer multiple of the quantum of flux, ωφ0, the field is called  toroidal.  Depending on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the condensation energy, this field is either stable or unstable. In this work, we study a subset of the stable solutions, those with integral flux quanta. We find that the ratio of the toroidal field energy to the rest of the star goes as the fifth power of the field strength, so there is little free energy in the field at typical neutron star fields. The field lines then naturally bundle in flux bundles of integral quanta. For a strong enough magnetic field, there is a discontinuity in the poloidal magnetic field, and the field is called force-free. This situation arises when there is a magnetic field-induced modification to the equation of state for the superconductor, so the magnetic and condensation energies are not in balance. A toroidal field modifies the structure of a neutron star in two primary ways. The magnetic pressure is enhanced in the core, increasing the pressure even as the density drops. This affects the dynamics of the inner crust, and the magnetic fields generated in this process. Second, if the field is strong enough, it",

Additionally, we compute the error on these fits and find that the error is consistent with being normally distributed. We compute the Hurst exponent h using the following equation: H = −γ / (a log(2) sqrt(ln2) β) where β is the fractal dimension, computed above. We find that Hurst values tend to fall in the range 0.5 < H < 1, indicating non-random fractal behavior. We compute the quantum entropy using the following equation: q = a log(2) / (ln2) and find that it scales similarly to the Hurst exponent, H, and thus is also a reliable metric for non-random fractal behavior. Finally, we show the results of these fractal fits on a Riemann surface, with particular focus on the vertical (X) axis. We observe that f(x) = a 1 - α(x - b)^c  fits the Riemann zeros very well, with errors consistent with a normally distributed random variable. We conclude that Riemann zeros fit the assumptions of fractals, and that fractal functions provide good fits to the Riemann zeros.",

In particular, we explore the dynamics of N3 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). We identify a stable nitroxide anion, tetramethyltetranitromethane (TMTN), as an efficient trap for N3 radicals. We demonstrate that dipolar coupling between electron and nuclear spins, arising from the anisotropic electron spin, enhances the rate of dynamic nuclear polarization by a factor of 6. Dipolar coupling has been proposed as an approach to increase the rate of DNP, but the enhancement we observe is an order of magnitude greater than that predicted by theory. This enhancement arises from a combination of faster electron relaxation in the TMTN radical and faster formation of N3 radicals in the TMTN radical trap, and we show that both effects contribute significantly to the enhancement. The rapid diffusion and high polarization we observe with N3 suggest that the approach may be extended to other solid radicals and has the potential to reduce DNP time to less than 1 ms.",

Spectral analysis shows that the observed radio emission is mostly composed of two thermal components: one is the spectrally broad and kinetically cool accelerated component, which is usually interpreted as electrons and heat deposited by precipitating beams; the other is the spectrum with little variance across the line profile, which may be contributed by the Maxwellian electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Compared with the off-limb observation on 21 May 2014 at 14:00 UT, we found that the beam-related emissions have a similar strength, whereas the mean electron density and the temperature of Maxwellian electrons decreased by 20% and 10%, respectively. This paper analyzes the spectral lines and their spatial derivatives to reveal how the density and velocity distribution of the thermal electrons change along the solar atmosphere. The results show that the density stratifies downward from the corona to the transition region, and the velocity distribution becomes more anisotropic with decreasing temperature. The density stratification indicates the beam-generated hot plasma is rooted in the lower solar atmosphere, and the velocity distribution anisotropy suggests that the beam particles propagate along the magnetic field. These results imply that both the beam formation and the propagation processes occur simultaneously in the lower solar atmosphere.",

While observational signatures of DM are sought by many methods, one of the most direct is the measurement of the velocity anisotropy of the DM particles as a function of their position within the cluster. We describe a method for measuring the DM velocity anisotropy, using optical observations of the cluster galaxies and strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies. We apply this method to the galaxy cluster MACS J0429.6-0253, combining our measurements of the projected mass distribution with strong lensing observations from the Subaru telescope. We find strong evidence for an axisymmetric DM velocity anisotropy in this cluster, with the amplitude of the anisotropy dependent on radius. Our results show that dark matter is not fully collisional, but instead retains some of its velocity memory from earlier times.

Due to the relatively high gas content of these galaxies, they often have detectable rotating disks of cold gas, which are often also embedded in dust.

A number of researchers have claimed that CNTs are gravitationally unstable. These claims have not yet been convincingly proven either by laboratory experiments or by computer simulations. It is therefore difficult to make accurate predictions about the nature and properties of these structures. This work attempts to study the problem of gravitational stability of CNTs using modern methods of computer simulations. The study was performed using the GRaphic PAthway Code (GPU-PCM), which is a highly efficient parallel computer code for solving the equations of hydrodynamics on a grid. The experiments were performed for a model of an elliptical galaxy with a low-mass companion, and for a model with a long-term evolution. The experiments have confirmed the dynamical stability of circumnuclear disks in both cases, and the specific angular momentum of the disk material was preserved over time. The simulations also revealed the complex spatial structure of the circumnuclear disks, with a complex patchwork of nonaxisymmetric clumps. However, it was not possible to determine the existence of a firmly established fundamental mode of the system.

Finally, we compare the LBNE proposal to other long-baseline neutrino experiments and to proposed neutrino sources.

The LBNE has the scientific goal of establishing whether or not short-baseline (~15 km) muon neutrino disappearance is caused by neutrino oscillations, and if so, to determine the nature of the disappearance; that is, whether it is due to normal or inverted mass hierarchy, and whether it involves maximal or minimal neutrino CP violation. If confirmed, these phenomena would indicate the presence of new particle species, leading to possible discoveries in particle physics. LBNE could also shed light on a possible conceptual conflict between the short and long distance scales implied by neutrino oscillations.

The behavior of such quantum fields underlie all known interactions. In particular, their exchange leads to the stability of the Standard Model (SM) electric charge, the spin of the particles, and the form of the interactions. If we extrapolate the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest possible energies, we expect the particle exchanges to involve gravitons, which could explain the observed gravity, and, possibly, also photons and fermions. In this work, we discuss the first option. Gravitons are the expected carrier of the gravitational interaction, which otherwise feels indirect through intermediate messengers. Photons and fermions are the two most massive particles in the SM. Therefore, it seems plausible that they could be the corresponding force carriers. However, the fact that they are spin-1/2 fermions rather than spin-2 bosons has so far prevented them from being observed. In this work, we propose a way for photons and fermions to interact directly, through a new Lorentz- and CPT-violating term in the Standard Model Lagrangian. We present a way to test this proposal in current and future colliders. Gravitons carry both the gravitational and Lorentz-violation interactions, leading to a unique signature of completely missing particles, with two corresponding jets emerging at high invariant mass. Photons and fermions only carry the gravitational interaction. Therefore, their phenomenological implications are different. Photons and fermions can decay to gravitons, so the signature would be two jets plus missing energy. If the graviton is the lightest of the new particles, the signature would instead be four jets. An excess of any of these signatures would be a hint of the underlying theory, which could also give an explanation for dark matter and the strong and weak forces.",

In this paper, we present the results of 1D numerical simulations of Balmer-dominated shocks in the strong shock limit, which enable us to characterize the nature of the transition zone and to compute its physical properties as a function of the shock parameters. We find that in strong shock limit, the width of the transition zone scales as the distance between the centers of the pre-shock and shock zone, while its temperature and velocity dispersion scale as the square root of the corresponding pre-shock values. Furthermore, we find that the fractional abundance of ionized carbon decreases exponentially from the pre-shock value to nearly zero across the shock front. We provide scaling relations which can be used to approximate the physical properties of the transition zone in between the pre-shock and post-shock regions, on the basis of the knowledge of the physical parameters of the incoming flow and of the shock.",

We compare this luminosity with modeling predictions from three distinct progenitor models for the Type Ibc SN 2018crp: a naked helium star (a Helium star with no external hydrogen or dust layer), a stripped-envelope star (a star with a hydrogen or helium envelope, but not enough to classify it as a blue supergiant), and a compact Wolf-Rayet star. All progenitor models predict X-ray luminosities that are highly inconsistent with the observed value. We determine that the X-ray emission from the forward shock radius must be suppressed via a break in the electron energy distribution; the suppression could be due to either a significantly steeper electron energy distribution (which requires a much faster ejecta expansion velocity or larger explosion energy), or a low-density environment surrounding the shock-suppressed region.

N-body simulations have proved to be a powerful tool for predicting the frequency and properties of satellite galaxies, but predictions still require observationally-informed scaling with the underlying dark matter halos. Recently, satellite galaxies have been identified in cosmological dark matter simulations, without including the baryonic physics that would likely disrupt them. In this work we use a set of zoomed-in, high-resolution cosmological simulations to examine the relation between mergers and the formation of satellite galaxies. We find a strong dependence of the survival of satellite galaxies on the relative masses of the satellite and its host, and on their orbital parameters. Satellite galaxies that are on highly eccentric orbits are much more likely to survive for several crossing times than those on more circular orbits. Satellites on prograde orbits around their host are more likely to survive than those on retrograde orbits, and satellites on highly radial orbits are more likely to survive than those on low-radius orbits. Satellite galaxies that form near the center of their host are more likely to survive than those that form far from the center. We also find that the internal structures of galaxies, as measured by their phase-space structure, are a better predictor of the fate of satellites than their dark matter halos. In particular, satellites that are either on radial orbits or on highly eccentric orbits will have large amounts of stars stripped from their outer parts. The time until all of the satellite’s stars are removed depends on its orbit, with radial orbits being more unstable than more circular orbits.

The maxima can be correlated to different transverse momentum states and therefore vary hybridizations of the molecular orbitals with the leads .We evaluate the temperature dependence of the conductance and estimate the hybridization widths .",

This is possible due to the recent development of a scheme for the determination of interfacial quantities from computer simulation of only the solute particle system. This approach is based on constructing interfaces in the simulation box that match a geometrical definition of interfacial surface, and monitoring various interfacial properties, such as average position and orientation of solute particles as a function of simulation configuration. In this way we are able to measure the interfacial tensions between two coexisting phases of tangent hard sphere chains (THC), a model system used extensively to test methods for computational interfacial studies. We find that the interfacial tensions between coexisting liquid and vapor phases and between liquid and solid phases are all positive and of similar magnitude (ca. 27 mN/m), in contrast to the typical situation in liquid-vapor and oil-water systems (ca. 40 mN/m), and hence more representative of real liquids. This is the first time that such direct measurement of interfacial tensions has been reported. A simple fundamental measure theory (FMT) approximation is shown to provide an excellent description of the interfacial tensions, and hence the FMT interface potential can be evaluated quite accurately.

Due to their relatively large size and high degree of stiffness, bottlebrush polymers are often unable to adapt to the irregularities in their embedding environments, and consequently exhibit inadequate processability and function in solution or the solid state. The problem of stiffness can be mitigated by incorporating chemically crosslinkable side chains on the bottlebrush, thereby allowing the brush segments to be crosslinked once for a global change in the stiffness of the brush. However, the brush and crosslinker segments then come into close proximity, and in the absence of specific non-covalent interactions, may undergo crosslinking, even at low degrees of conversion. Here we show that mutual interaction between the brush and crosslinker segments – namely π-π interaction between the side chain polymers and Flory-Huggins interaction between the fluorocarbon and carbon backbone polymers – leads to crosslinking-induced softening of the brush stiffness. This approach allows independent control of stiffness and processability of bottlebrush polymers through appropriate selection of non-covalent and covalent interactions. The approach is validated by rheological and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a bottlebrush polymer in which the brush is formed by ethyloxazoline monomers and the side chains are formed by tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TMSSI). Mutual interaction between TMSSI side chains and ethyloxazoline brush segments leads to a large decrease in the bottlebrush stiffness without a significant change in the weight average molecular weight. A novel two-step crosslinking approach is developed that enables gradual and controllable crosslinking of the TMSSI side chains in a spatially and temporally decoupled manner from global crosslinking of the ethyloxazoline brush segments. The approach presented here provides a powerful strategy to independently tune the processability and stiffness in bottlebrush polymer systems, with broad potential applicability across other bottlebrush architectures.",

Date: 2023 Author: Yosuke Kimura Title: Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stationary, spherically symmetric black hole in de Sitter space with a constant positive curvature. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Hawking radiation and the Bunch-Davies vacuum, and find that the de Sitter horizon is a effective change of the vacuum. We also consider the small mass case, and calculate the particle creation rate and the energy flux near the horizon. We find that the energy flux becomes a positive number even in de Sitter space, which violates the cosmic no-hair conjecture. Why do we care about Hawking radiation from black holes in de Sitter spaces? The AdS/CFT correspondence, which was proposed by M. M. Roberts, V. A. Hubeny, C. Ranganathan, and E. funcatsbooks.com, relates a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to a conformal field theory in physical space-time. Since then, there have been many studies of quantum effects in AdS spaces, such as black holes and cosmological horizons. One reason to study the effects of quantum gravity in AdS spaces is to understand the higher-dimensional gravity itself from a view point of the lower-dimensional CFT. On the other hand, the cosmological constant in the universe is very tiny but non-zero. It has been suggested that quantum effects of the gravity could generate a positive cosmological constant. This means that the AdS space corresponds to an inflationary universe. Thus, studying quantum effects in AdS spaces provides a possible way to explain the very small but non-zero cosmological constant. However, the AdS spaces have a time-like curvature, and thus the physics in the boundary CFT does not have a time direction. This means that, since the Hawking radiation is a process from the past of the boundary, it does not affect the CFT. Thus, one cannot discuss the Cosmic No Hair conjecture from the AdS/CFT correspondence. The cosmic no-hair conjecture is that black holes in an expanding universe should have the same conserved quantities as the universe.

The idea is to partition the source message into layers, and encode the layers with a long block length assuming perfect knowledge of the headers of the lower layers. The headers are further encoded with shorter length assuming imperfect knowledge of the lower layer headers. The resulting coding rate can be conveniently optimized over the Gaussian distribution, leading to an optimal layered coding strategy that is able to approach the capacity of the underlying multi-user discrete memoryless channel (DMMC) within 1 bit per channel use for many channels of interest. Successive refinement, however, typically incurs an accumulated distortion that increases with the length of the encoding block. In particular, for a DMMC with memory size K, when the encoding block length is no greater than (the so-called max-delay), the distortion can be shown to increase linearly with the block length. When the block length exceeds (the so-called delay-limited regime), the distortion can be shown to increase at most linearly with the block length. The exact slope in the delay-limited regime, which we refer to as the delay-regime slope, has been identified for only a few DMMC examples. In this work, we provide a general result for the delay-limited regime slope, which is shown to coincide with the latest know result for several specific examples, including the Hyperlabel Broadcast Channel (HLC) and the Gaussian Multi-Unicast with Successive Refinement (MUSIC).",

It is therefore important to study prompt emission separately from afterglow emission. Here, we report the broadband afterglow and prompt emission of the bright burst GRB 061121. The afterglow phase covers the optical, UV and X-ray bands and can be well described with a single power-law. In the gamma-ray band, the prompt emission can be well described by the Band function.

Globular clusters are gravitationally bound collections of millions of stars. Because they are so compact, the light from the individual stars in a globular cluster can substantially pollute its surface brightness profile. Therefore, accurate measurement of surface brightness profiles for globular clusters is critical for studying their structural parameters, especially their half-mass radii, which can be used to place constraints on the halflight radii of their host galaxies. In this study, we obtained $VI$ images of the globular clusters using the photometric system of the CTIO 0.9-m telescope. A PSF-fitting program was used to measure the surface brightnesses of the clusters, and the resulting profiles are presented here. The profiles are presented for two intervals in radius, one centered on the half-mass radius and one centered on the half-light radius, and have been fitted with the models of the truncated isothermal sphere, the logarithmic sphere, and the generalized-Sersic model. For Fornax globular clusters, the generalized-Sersic profile provided the best fit to the data. In general, the globular cluster surface brightness profiles follow the same general trends in all three galaxies, i.e., the Fornax globular clusters have the steepest profiles, the LMC globular clusters have profiles between the Fornax and the SMC profiles, and the SMC globular clusters have the shallowest profiles. The surface brightnesses at a given radius for the globular clusters in a given galaxy tend to increase with the total luminosity of the galaxy.",

We have demonstrated that excitation of electromagnetically non-dispersive shock waves is possible even in an isotropic plasma, i.e. when the electron flow velocity and the magnetic field have equal amplitudes. By means of numerical simulations, we have found that this phenomenon is possible due to the symmetry breaking effect, namely, if the plasma is uniformly magnetized in one direction, it is possible to generate electromagnetic shock waves with any direction in the isotropic plasma. Additionally, we have shown that in the framework of the NLS and MHD equations, it is possible to generate electromagnetic wave-like solitons when the flow velocity and magnetic field are of different amplitudes.

In this scenario, the observable universe is viewed as a three-brane that is a domain wall living in the AdS space. In order to have an exit from the domain wall curvature instabilities, a bulk scalar field is introduced. This field, called the chameleon field, couples to the world volume of the brane via the Israel coupling, where the coupling strength is related to the brane tension. By analyzing the equations of motion we obtain the conditions on the brane tension and bulk potential such that the theory acquires a healthy stable 4D gravity at low energy. By using these conditions we show that the mass of the Planck particle can be naturally generated. We also study the possibility that the supersymmetry is broken on the brane. To that end we introduce explicit (F) and soft (D) breaking terms to the brane supergravity Lagrangian. We show that without the explicit breaking, all the scalar masses are determined only by the brane tension and the gravitino mass, and thus are naturally of order of the gravitino mass. With explicit breaking, the scalar masses can be naturally of order one, if some conditions are satisfied on the soft parameters. Our results suggest that in order to explain the 4D gravity we live in from the 5D fundamental theory, the theory might be supersymmetric on the brane. Supersymmetry breaking on the brane naturally explains the hierarchy between the Planck and the Electroweak scales without postulating large extra dimensions, and thus provides a rationale for low fundamental gravity scale.",

The two objects have very similar effective temperatures and gravitational moments, and are, accordingly, very close on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. We have monitored their eclipse timings for many years and detect different trends in their binary orbits. After combining our data with earlier results, we are able to determine an empirical relation between the binary period and the average time interval between consecutive eclipses. This allows us to determine an observational period for HP Librae of 83.86 hours and for V803 Centauri of 82.21 hours, or twice these values. The accuracy of our determination is sufficient to provide the first significant detection of the oscillation period in the binary orbit of HP Librae. We discuss possible origins for these periodicities and examine the implications of our findings for our current understanding of these objects. * * * We are conducting a long-term observational study of the eclipse timing of AM CVn stars HP Librae and V803 Centauri. The results of this work will improve our understanding of the binary systems in which these stars reside and may also lead to new insights into the nature of these systems. In particular, our results will allow us to determine the binary period of HP Librae with improved accuracy, which will allow us to study the oscillations in the binary orbit of this star in more detail. This will provide further constraints on the properties of the system and perhaps help to reveal its nature. Furthermore, by determining the binary period of V803 Centauri we will be able to confirm or rule out the possibility that this star is a fast rotator and to study its pulsations in more detail. Finally, the empirical relationship we have determined will allow other teams to more easily analyse the eclipse timing data for other AM CVn systems and to thereby further increase our understanding of these objects. We have obtained new timings for the eclipses of HP Librae and V803 Centauri from 2016 through to 2019. We then combined these new results with older data obtained between 2008 and 2015 in a method similar to that employed by Vanlandingham et al. (2008). This enabled us to detect different trends in the binary orbits of HP Librae and V803 Centauri and to determine empirical relationships between the binary period and the average time interval between consecutive eclipses.

In this work we focus on systems with cubic anisotropy, in which out-of-plane spontaneous magnetization is preferred to in-plane magnetizations due to interfacial interactions. Using the thin-film approach, we present a comprehensive study of STT as a function of the number of atomic layers in the multilayer, compositional disorder, magnetic anisotropy and temperature. It is shown that STT in Co/Cu and Ni/Cu multilayers can be efficiently controlled by adjusting the number of atomic layers in these layers. Furthermore, it is observed that Cu layers do not allow the magnetization to stabilize in the out-of-plane direction, whereas Ni layers stabilize the magnetization in this direction. Thus, changing the number of atomic layers in these heterostructures enables the control of the interfacial STT.

Perez arXiv.org eprint arXiv:1603.00711   physics.gen-ph, March 14, 2016  In this paper we discuss a conceptually simple, well-controlled, and quantitative approach to modeling gene regulation in a eukaryotic organism. The regulatory region of the copy number control region of Viral DNA is described by a mathematically idealized one-dimensional single-link chain polymer. Individual viral genomes occupy sites on this one-dimensional chain and exert a positional effect on the rate of transcription initiation by the host RNA polymerase II enzyme. As described by a rate equation, the general behavior of this gene regulation system can be understood by considering the probability of a polymerase binding to a particular site. For an appropriate choice of physically based parameters, we show that this system exhibits cooperative behavior -- an increased probability of binding at nearby sites relative to a simple addition of independent probabilities. The relative probability of cooperative binding depends on chain length, valence (number of neighboring sites bound with probability increased by interactions), and temperature. We discuss implications of our observations for biological systems. In summary, we present a physically based model for eukaryotic gene regulation in which binding cooperativity plays a central role. This physical concept, which has long been of interest in other biological systems, here reveals its importance in eukaryotic gene regulation. Our model is distinguished from others by its clear physical basis and a quantitative description of its behavior. It makes specific predictions about the effect of chain length, valence, temperature, and sequence on the probability of cooperative binding. These predictions can be directly tested against existing data and against results from alternative models. Our model also suggests testable experimental protocols for exploring the role of cooperative binding in eukaryotic gene regulation.

In conventional (CPP) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the spin-polarized current flowing across the interface between the ferromagnet and the tunnel junction leads to a spin-transfer torque (STT) that can rotate the magnetic direction of the free ferromagnetic layer. For magnetic tunnel junctions, this effect can be used to write information by manipulating the magnetic orientation of the reference layer. Here, we report a novel technique to characterize STT-based magnetic memories by measuring the spin transfer torque vector rather than the STT vector itself. This technique employs a modified Hanle effect to measure the projection of the STT vector onto the direction of an applied magnetic field. We apply this technique to a MTJ and measure the projection of the STT vector onto the x-axis, which is parallel to the easy axis of the free ferromagnetic layer.

One of them is the presence of a critical surface energy density which separates two different regimes with different outcomes. In the presence of this surface energy density, the Big Rip doesn’t happen but the universe transits from a period of inflation to a decelerating phase without crossing the surface energy density. We study three different examples in this work and show that depending on the form of this critical energy density, the nature of the universe can be dominated by different entities. For example, if the critical surface energy density is positive, then it can be the energy density of some dark energy fluid. On the other hand, if the critical energy density has a negative value, then it can be the energy density of ordinary matter.

        "original_text": "In this paper, we present cosmological solutions in superstring theory with positive vacuum energy and positive spatial curvature. These solutions describe an early period of inflation, followed by a de Sitter period. The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories, where only closed string theories have negative curvature, is also discussed. Inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is supported by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory. In superstring theories, the vacuum energy typically has a positive value. However, different supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings give vacuum energies with different signs. Thus, if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories, we need to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive. In this paper, we show that the combination of compactifications, axion fields, and various uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories. Inflationary de Sitter solutions have been previously obtained from supergravity. Here we obtain these solutions from the theory of superstrings. This is an important distinction, as it may lead to observational signatures that could distinguish between these two scenarios. For example, the graviton zero-mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity, whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory. Thus, observations of cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio may be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. Another important distinction is in the energy scale of the proposed collider experiments. In superstring theory, the graviton and other particles have predicted mass scales of approximately $10^{15}$ GeV, whereas in supergravity these mass scales are much lower, of order $10^{16}$ GeV. Thus, if future experiments are able to detect a nonzero gravitational wave background, this may point to inflation occurring in the early universe after a period of superstring theory. This paper is a preliminary investigation of inflation from superstrings. There are many interesting open questions that we have not yet considered. For example, if we also wish to obtain a period of $N$th order inflation, with $N$ being larger than two, the analysis will require a more careful treatment of higher order corrections to the superpotential and Kähler potential. We also need to consider a range of various moduli and extranet field values, as well as the dependence on the full string theory landscape. Another important question is the effect of moduli stabilization on the vacuum energy and the possibility of obtaining realistic cosmology. The proposed collider signatures also need to be modified in the full superstring theory framework. Thus, although this paper presents a novel possibility for obtaining inflationary cosmology from superstrings, we recognize that more work needs to be done to realize this possibility in practice.

        "watermark_text": "In this paper , we present cosmological solutions in superstring theory with positive vacuum energy and positive spatial curvature . These solutions define an early period of inflation , followed by a de Sitter time .The possibility of having a positive spatial curvature in superstring theories , where only closed string systems have negative curvature , is also discussed . Inflation , a period of rapid expansion in the early universe , is backed by both observations and theoretical considerations in superstring theory .In superstring physics , the vacuum energy generally has a positive value . However , different supersymmetry ( SUSY ) breakings produce vacuum energies with various signs .Thus , if we wish to have a period of inflation in superstring theories , we require to ensure that the vacuum energy is positive . In this paper , we prove that the combination of compactifications , axion fields , and many uplifting fields leads to an inflationary de Sitter solution with positive vacuum energy in superstring theories .Inflationary de Sitter systems have been previously derived from supergravity . Here we obtain these solutions from the principle of superstrings .This is an important distinction , as it could lead to observational signatures that might distinguish between these two scenarios . For instance , the graviton zero - mode gives a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy in supergravity , whereas it will not contribute to the vacuum energy in superstring theory .Thus , observations of cosmological factors such as the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio may be possible to distinguish between these two scenarios .

These universal invariants satisfy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory, a calculation of the fundamental group, and the universal coefficients theorem. In this framework, the strong Novikov conjecture, which states that the higher signatures of a closed manifold are universal among degree-one cohomology classes, is equivalent to the homotopy invariance of higher K-theory. This implies that the higher K-groups satisfy the Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, under certain hypotheses, also detect exotic elements in the stable homology of manifolds. We also establish twisted versions of these universal invariants and apply them to the Bismut intersection formula, the Borel regulator, and elliptic genera. This approach to higher K-theory and universal invariants extends to other stable homotopy theories, such as bordism and generalized cohomology. In particular, we define twisted variants of these theories and show how to compute these variants using the invariants defined here. This approach unifies the study of K-theory, bordism, generalized cohomology, and stable homotopy by viewing these theories as localizations of a single universal theory of stable derived functors. In particular, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for topological K-theory arises as the key element in the localization process. In addition to defining this universal theory of stable derived functors, we also calculate its rationalization. This provides a powerful way to determine the rational homology of one-point compactifications of hyperbolic groups, which may be of independent interest.

The solution is based on the existence of large n species of dark matter, each with a particle mass of order 1 GeV. These dark matter particles interact via new forces, with strength parameter λ, which are suppressed by a large compactification volume Ω. As a result, the lightest of the dark matter species, Δ, has a freeze out temperature of order λΩ and a abundance matching current observational bounds. As Δ subsequently annihilates to Standard Model particles, it releases sufficient energy to cancel the vacuum energy density indicated by current observations. The relationship between λ, Ω and the hierarchy problem is explored. It is shown that by having Ω depend exponentially on n, large n species can lead to the correct dark matter relic density without the need for a cancelation at the global level.

In this scenario, the parameters of the CMSSM are fully determined by just four input parameters: the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu). Current experimental data, in particular the measured values of the physical masses of the quarks and leptons, can be used to determine preferred values for these CMSSM parameters. However, in this paper we show that in addition to the parameters m0, a0, tan beta, and sign(mu), another SUSY breaking parameter, the gluino mass, MLsp, also takes on a preferred value when these experimental constraints are imposed. We call this new and significantly more general CMSMS scenario the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). We perform a global fits to the CMSSM and CMSMS parameters m0, a0, tan beta, sign(mu), and MLsp to the measured masses of the sparticles and the HPS1 parameters, alpha(GUT), m0(3), and A0, determining the best-fit points and 1 sigma errors for these parameters. The global best-fit point for the CMSSM is found for m0 = 150.7 GeV, a0 = -3.14 TeV, tan beta = 5.9, sign(mu) = 1, and MLsp = 985 GeV. For the CMSMS, the best-fit point is m0 = 131.6 GeV, a0 = -3.2 TeV, tan beta = 8.4, sign(mu) = -1, and MLsp = 983 GeV. Thus, we observe that, within the context of the CMSMS, the gluino mass can be significantly lower than in the CMSSM. This is very significant, as lower values of MLsp greatly expand the LHC LHC phenomenological realm, with larger values of MLsp yielding a more constrained LHC phenomenology. We find, however, that the best-fit points for both the CMSSM and the CMSMS are quite close and are consistent with one another, indicating that the difference between these two scenarios is not statistically significant. The values of the universal scalar mass parameter, m0, the universal trilinear scalar coupling parameter, a0, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan beta, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter, sign(mu), that are preferred by current experimental data within the context of the CMSSM are also consistent with those favored by current data in the CMSMS.

We present a hierarchical model for galaxy mergers that includes both dry and wet mergers, and show that such a model naturally produces elliptical galaxies with massive bulges. We further argue that this framework can simultaneously reproduce the observed abundance and evolution of elliptical galaxies and the quasar luminosity function.

The model includes three parts: presynaptic, postsynaptic, and the interaction between the two. The presynaptic component includes an mGluR that is activated by an increase in the concentration of a presynaptic neurotransmitter. This leads to the mobilization of calcium via a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C cascade. This calcium influx results in the synthesis of critical proteins involved in L-LTP maintenance. The postsynaptic part includes the synthesis of glutamate receptors that have a half-life of several hours. Finally, the interaction between the two parts includes the production of long-term depression (L-LTD) when the combined postsynaptic glutamate and presynaptic neurotransmitter concentrations decrease.

Fluid mechanics, in turn, is the study of fluid behavior not involving radiation or mechanical phenomena. The dynamics of a viscous fluid may be described by the hydrodynamic equations: the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of fluid mass; the fluid velocity, which is the statement of Newton s law of motion, and an appropriate velocity specification such as no flow across boundaries (no slip) or in canals (zero shear); and the conservation of momentum, which is the statement of force production due to contact friction and other sources not already included in the fluid mass equation. General relativity is the study of the effects of gravity on the propagation of light. General relativity is one of the most comprehensive and successful descriptions of the laws of physics, accounting for all known forms of energy, including mass-energy and matter, electromagnetic, and nuclear energy. It also describes the dynamics of spacetime, the construction of spacetime itself. The theory arose from attempts to reconcile the Ideas of Isaac Newton regarding an universal and singularly elegant theory of gravity with the correct description of the movements of the planets and stars. In particular, general relativity accurately describes the behavior of light on the scale of planets and stars, while Newton s theory does not appear to adequately explain such observations.

        "original_text": "Massive black holes exist in all massive galaxies. They grow over time due to accretion of matter. Their masses can be estimated using the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The plane is based on three parameters, namely the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, the stellar velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole. The first two are measured for the galaxy, while the third one can be estimated using the black hole s mass. The latter two are strongly correlated and can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole. Such estimation has been done for a large sample of galaxies and it was found that more massive galaxies have on average more massive black holes. This correlation can be expressed as a linear relation of the form: M_{BH} = A x M_{spheroid} + B where M_{BH} is the mass of the black hole, M_{spheroid} is the mass of the spheroid, A is a coefficient close to 7 and B is a constant. This relation was found to be true for galaxies of all Hubble types, but especially for early-types. The correlations with the host galaxy properties were stronger for the spheroid than for the black hole mass, which can be explained by the merger driven growth of black holes. The scatter of the relation can be reduced by using another observable, namely the luminosity of the spheroid. The latter can be estimated using the velocity dispersion and the radius of the sphere of influence, which are required for the former. The latter can be estimated from the B-band luminosity of the galaxy. It was found that the scatter of the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation is significantly lower than for the other relations, and the best-fit coefficient is closer to 10, which can be explained by more accurate measurements and less intrinsic scatter in the spheroid luminosity. It is suggested that the black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation can be used as a new standard for estimating the black hole mass.

        "original_text": "Free core nutation, also known as temporal nutation, is a relatively fast component of Earth s rotation. It is directly proportional to the axial wobble, which in turn is driven by the planet s mass and moment of inertia. Temporal nutation is measured by satellites with very high precision, which has enabled detection of Free Core Nutation Frequency (FCNF). FCNF is caused by modulation of Earth s axis of rotation in the Free Core Nutation Mode. The amplitude of FCNF may vary with time and gives information about dynamics of Earth s core. In this study we analyze an existing database of FCNF observations from space. We apply two methods to extract theFCNF signal from the noise. The first one is based on statistical hypothesis testing and calculates the significance of FCNF signal. The second one is based on empirical mode decomposition and identifies components of FCNF signal. The results of both methods are consistent and show that the amplitude of FCNF varies with time. This indicates that dynamics of Earth s core may be of interest for scientists.",

        "original_text": "This work revisits the ideal fluid dynamics on Lie groups from a control perspective. It is well-known that such theories can be obtained from the Lagrangian formulation of the celebrated Euler equation on the diffeomorphism group of a three dimensional Riemannian manifold. An equivalent Hamiltonian description using the theory of Lie groupoids and Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groupoids is proposed, and explicit constructions are given for some important special cases including fluid dynamics on Lie groups, Newtonian gravity on the special orthogonal group and the general linear group, and the classical ECSK theory of non-relativistic gravity. In the Hamiltonian description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics are described by a Lie groupoid, with the fluid dynamics being a particular case in which the source of the gauge groupoid morphism is the diffeomorphism group of the fluid domain. In particular, in the particle description, the fluid dynamics on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics can be seen as resulting from a deformation quantization of the source groupoid. It is shown that the Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of quantum mechanics, arises as the geodesic equation for the magnetic connection of the deformation quantization. This permits the construction of a mechanical system which realizes ideal hydrodynamics in the large, namely which exhibits the geodesic flow of a specific left-invariant metric on the solution groupoid. The resulting system is presented in explicit form for the example of ideal fluid dynamics on the special orthogonal group. It is also shown that the system so constructed is Hamiltonian with respect to a modified symplectic structure, corresponding to that of Dubois-Viallet on the Lie group corresponding to the special orthogonal group. Some exact solutions are also presented.",

When resonant loss features of these media are broadened by radiative processes, the resulting local-field enhancement and media degeneration can lead to significant refraction and absorption reduction. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, this phenomenon of negative refraction and absorption reduction in a resonant plasmon-radiative medium based on inverse Faraday rotation in a thin yttrium iron garnet film. The observed resonant refraction reduction of over 25% is greater than that of standard resummed negative-index media. The derived absorption reduction is greater than 10% in the measured frequency range, which is the largest value reported for any resonant plasmon-radiative medium.

        "original_text": "The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is a powerful method to analyze the behavior of gravitation in systems consisting of compact objects. The first post-Newtonian approximation (1PN) of general relativity (GR) was constructed by Einstein and Rosen in 1932. Scalar-tensor theory (STT) generalizes GR by generalizing the graviton into a more general scalar field, leading to additional gravitational degrees of freedom. The most general STT action consistent with general covariance and single-scalar-fieldsymmetry is that of Horndeski. In 1981, Deffayet et al. found a novel class of scalar-tensor theories, known as scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling (STT NGC ), which differ from general STT by the form of the coupling function. To first order in the usual PN parameter ( = GM/(rc^2)), where M and r are the mass and distance of the system, respectively, and G is the Gravitational constant, the equations of motion for a two-body system in general STT NGC  differ from those of GR only by 2.5PN order, because the self-coupling of the scalar field enters at 1.5PN order. In 2015, Brax et al. showed that a special case of STT NGC  called scalar-tensor-relativistic theory (STR) is a good approximation to general STT in a large class of spherically symmetric solutions, dubbed nearly solutions. To zeroth order in the usual PN parameter, the equation of motion for a nearly spherically symmetric system in STR is fourth order and reduces to the ordinary Emden equation, whose solutions are exact scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with a finite horizon. In this Letter we consider the slow motion of particles around such black holes and compare the resulting scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Hamiltonians with the ones of GR. We find that: i) in the 1.5PN and 2PN orders, the first terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR differ from those of GR, respectively, by scalar and Gauss-Bonnet topological invariants; ii) the 1PN terms in the potential and precession Hamiltonians of STR are proportional to the square of the absolute value of the Det of the spatial metric. Henceforth, these invariants vanish for black holes in Einstein gravity. In conclusion, we have obtained the 2PN approximation of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the GI was found to be decreasing in many countries, indicating that the virus could remain viable in the population for a shorter time. This could help the virus spread throughout the population more quickly, or it could lead to increased uncertainty about when an individual is contagious, which could compromise vaccination strategies or other mitigation strategies that depend on knowing the timing of infection. To understand this phenomenon, we analyse data on COVID-19 cases in Australia, Brazil, Italy, and the United States. We find that changes in GI vary over time, following trends in cumulative cases. This allowed us to build a model of GI that reproduces the observed time series with high accuracy. We also find that changes in GI are positively correlated with changes in cumulative cases, both globally and on annual timescales, which indicates that the observed contraction in GI is a global phenomenon. Our findings indicate that real-time monitoring of COVID-19 GI can help public health authorities better understand the COVID-19 pandemic and respond more effectively.",

As dopant atoms have different lattice structure from the host semiconductor, they may offer novel opportunities to investigate quantum systems at low temperature. Here we demonstrate this concept by employing an electrically-tunable scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to locally modify the electronic structure of a single atom of SiC. The application of a rapid voltage pulse modifies the electronic structure of the donor atom such that a distinct feature can be observed in the dI/dV spectrum acquired using the STM. This approach could enable electrical detection and control of individual dopants in silicon carbide, paving the way for investigations of quantum states in nanoscale devices and development of atomic-scale sensors with these novel properties.

Noteworthy, two recent high-throughput RNA sequencing studies have revealed that up to 98% of eukaryotic genomes are transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). While the functions of most ncRNAs are not understood, increasing lines of evidence suggest that ncRNAs are vital parts of gene regulatory networks that are crucial for development, cell differentiation, and many other processes in living organisms.

We develop a hybrid differential stereoscopic (HDS) system based on structured light using two synchronized broadband optical filter liquid crystal displays (LCDs). We apply this system to a spectral imaging modality that uses white light to estimate the spatial temperature profile of a scene. The approach we present combines the high spectral resolution of multi-bandpass filter spectrography with the wide field of view and high spatial resolution of structured light. We experimentally demonstrate that HDS allows for measurement of temperature differences as small as 1 degree across a 200 meter field of view with sub-millimeter resolution. We find that with additional processing, this narrowband HDS system has the sensitivity to detect temperature differences as small as 1/1000 of a degree across the same 200 meter field of view. This approach overcomes several of the limitations of previous narrowband HDS works, such as the Pollefeys et al. system which uses only a single optical filter, or the Huang et al. system which uses high-end filter spectrography but only has a 30 meter field of view. We believe this work represents a novel method for narrowband HDS that will have significant impact across many scientific and commercial spectral imaging modalities.",

In contrast to most gamma-ray telescopes, EGRET detected nearly all blazars as highly polarized gamma rays, and nearly all exhibit substantial variability on many different timescales. Blazars are widely believed to be the brightest class of gamma-ray sources and their spectra are typically well-fitted by a simple power law of photon index around 2.2. We perform the first SIND analysis of high-energy gamma-ray blazars using a complete flux-rescaled sample selected from the third EGRET catalog and demonstrate that the SIND of EGRET blazars is consistent with a one-dimensional truncated power law with an exponential cutoff. The slope of the blazar SIND at high energy (E > 100 MeV) is approximately -2.2, while the slope at lower energies is slightly shallower. The high-energy index is similar to that of the low-energy gamma-ray flux, though with large error bars.

Independent observations of this phenomena have only been available since the late 2000s, so when exactly the universe started to accelerate has been a subject of significant debate. In this paper, we use a suite of different datasets to measure the timing of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. We find that while there is a high degree of agreement on the average transition time, the precision with which it has been determined is highly dependent on the choice of dataset used. Our findings indicate that cosmologists may have overestimated the uncertainty in the timing of the transition, with the impact on the design of future dark energy surveys being discussed. The acceleration of the cosmic expansion was first observed in the late 2000s, and since then its cause has been a subject of intense study. Indirect evidence for this phenomenon, based on measurements of the cosmological parameters, only became available during the past decade. Consequently, the question of precisely when the expansion started to accelerate has been a topic of debate.

Our results are based on recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) – the afterglow of the Big Bang – lensing of the background light by large scale structures and direct measurements of the expansion rate of the universe using distant supernovae.

        "original_text": "In the first part of this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that solves the advection-diffusion equation with moving boundaries (i.e. free boundaries). The algorithm is based on a discrete ordinates approach, using a finite difference method to discretize in both space and velocity. This method is exact if the boundaries are periodic or advected with a linear velocity. We show that it is also consistent if the advection speed is linearly interpolated between the cell center and the boundary. In practice, this method is useful as long as the advection speed is not too large, or the spatial resolution is not too poor. As an example of its application, we simulate the growth of solids in a viscous accretion disk. We test our algorithm on analytical solutions of the diffusion-advection equation and show that our results are in agreement with the expected analytical solution. We then use our algorithm to study the evolution of solids in a viscous accretion disk with various sets of initial conditions. In all cases, solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale. In the second part, we study the effect of solids on the dust evolution in the disk. Solids generate a size distribution that differs from that of dust grains. In particular, solids tend to generate a significant amount of sub-micron sized grains. The exact form of this size distribution depends on the size and composition of solids. In this part, we present several simple models to investigate the influence of solids on the dust evolution. We show that solids with a given size and composition produce different consequences on the dust size distribution. Finally, we show that the exact form of the size distribution is of little importance for the dust evolution in the most part of the disk: after about one million year only large grains are present in the disk and the evolution is fully determined by the dust settling and the radial drift. We conclude that solids cannot reach the central star within a ten thousand year time scale, but they are a major actor of the dust evolution.

In this work, we present new HESRG data on the enigmatic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, whose 2006 outburst has historically been among the most energetic witnessed in the modern era. We interpret our data within the framework of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) to cosmic-rays, and we make a number of novel inferences. We find that the electrons and ions can be well-fitted by a single power-law of common index -2.29 with no indication of any break or steepening at the hadron-to-electron transition, and that their non-thermal emission undergoes a rapid but smooth transition from keV to MeV energy bands. From comparison with nonlinear DSA theory, we deduce that electrons are most likely accelerated to 300 TeV - 1 EeV via magnetic reconnection events within a high-speed magnetospheric outflow from the binary system, whilst ions are accelerated to 30 GeV - 1 TeV, within a slower but more-diffuse wind. We finally compare our results with previous predictions from the light-echo observations of the 2010 outburst of RS Ophiuchi - with which we likewise detect non-thermal emission - and find excellent agreement for electron energies but substantial tension for ion energies. We conclude that our results provide compelling new evidence that nonlinear DSA is an enabling paradigm for the acceleration of both electrons and ions to the very-high-energies observed in cosmic-ray sources.",

        "original_text": "The article aims to overview the recent development in the understanding of cosmological shock waves. These are fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in an abrupt change of properties of a fluid, usually characterized by a supersonic flow jump. In cosmology these shock waves appear in the inhomogeneous distribution of matter which leads to the formation of large scale structure. There are two distinct types of these shock waves which are discriminated by the velocity of the fluid movement before and after the shock. Type 1 shocks appear in relatively low velocity flows, i.e., slower than the speed of light. These shock waves appear in the matter accretion, i.e., the process by which clusters of galaxies formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe. These shocks go under names such as sound waves or collapse shocks. They can be described by a fairly simple linear theory, which has been verified against numerical simulations. Type 2 shocks appear in the flow of high velocity gas, i.e., relativistic or transonic motions. These shock waves are more frequent and more interesting to study than the former. The Hubble flow, which is the motion of galaxies relative to the observer, appears as a type 2 shock wave. Cosmological type 2 shock waves have been invoked to explain phenomena such as the 511 keV line emission from the galactic center, the large scale structure, and the Kolmogorov spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the cosmological shock wave phenomenon. This is because new observational discoveries such as the 511 keV line, and highly contrasted galaxy clusters have shown the need to go beyond the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. In the cosmological world, there is more variation in the matter density and velocity fields than what would be expected from a simple homogenous and isotropic model. It is now known that type 2 shock waves are generic features of cosmological fluid flows. Their behavior, however, depends on the features of the underlying cosmology, which can no longer be described by a simple parameterization. The study of cosmological shock waves requires the use of numerical simulations and increasingly sophisticated analytic methods. The article is organized as follows. The theory and observation of type 1 shock waves is presented in section 2. The formation of large scale structure is formulated as a type 1 shockwave in Section 3. Section 4 presents an analytic model for type 1 shock waves. In Section 5, numerical simulations of the formation of structure are reviewed.

        "original_text": "Fermi’s golden rule (FGR) is an intuitive principle for understanding the rates of quantum system evolution. It states that the rate of some physical process is proportional to the second power of the density of states (DOS) of the initial states to final states available in the process. This proportionality constant is known as the strength of the process. The rule is exact for weak system-bath couplings. For molecular relaxation time scale quantum systems, the FGR predicted exponential dependence of the relaxation time on the thermal energy. Experimental verification of this prediction using Infrared (IR) photon emission rates for different temperatures showed the predicted dependence only for high temperatures, while for low temperatures the relaxation time is much shorter than expected. This result was interpreted as a signature of quantum dynamical phase transition (QDPT) in terms of scale-invariant behavior of the system. Subsequent theoretical analysis for a general quantum mechanical system with weak system-bath coupling shows the dependence of the relaxation time on the temperature is not exponential, but rather power-law. This finding was later supported by numerous experiments on different quantum systems. In this paper, we argue that the theoretical framework for analyzing the FGR based on scale-invariance is not applicable to realistic quantum systems. In particular, we focus on the initial proposal of QDPT based on exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation time and show that this assumption leads to incorrect conclusion about the validity of FGR. We then analyze the relaxation time and the FGR within a phenomenological microscopic quantum relaxation model. We show that the relaxation time as a function of temperature has a power law instead of exponential dependence as predicted by the FGR. Using the microscopic model, we fit the relaxation time for different temperature and extract the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters. The analysis based on microscopic parameters reveals that for low temperatures, the quantum criticality disappears and the microscopic model predictions agree with the classical model. We further show that the power-law temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters leads to the power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation time, in agreement with the results obtained using the phenomenological model. Our analysis shows that the FGR cannot be applied to quantum systems within the QDPT framework. We also propose an alternative perspective on the quantum dynamical phase transition, and show that QDPT exists only for the classical system, and does not exist in the limit of quantum system. Our analysis shows that the QDPT is a manifestation of classical mechanics in the quantum system due to approximation of neglecting quantum interference effects. Using the proposed alternative perspective, we show that the scale-invariance is a valid principle for the quantum dynamical phase transition. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism of quantum dynamical phase transition in the classical limit, and suggests that the scale-invariance is not a fundamental symmetry of the quantum system, but a long-distance emergent behavior in the classical limit.",

The proof is based on the so-calledyss Hamiltonian decomposition, which allows one to write the partition function of the spin glass model as a product of simpler terms, each corresponding to a particular configuration of frozen spins. The nature of the frozen spins implies that the couplings between corresponding terms in the Ising and spin glass models are positive, and thus the whole product has to be positive, allowing us to restrict the consideration to positive Boltzmann weights, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The mapping is carried out for general graphs, meaning that the underlying lattice structure is not specified. We expect the following direct implications of the presented results: 1. The existence of a zero temperature phase transition in the Ising and spin glass models with proper choice of parameters is equivalent. 2. The critical behavior at the zero temperature phase transition of the Ising and spin glass models is identical. 3.

However, for spin glasses, this global $Z_2$ symmetry is broken at any finite temperature due to the presence of frozen spins.

Our approach starts from a generalized Hubbard model with full SU(4) symmetry. Using a combination of non-perturbative methods, namely the Functional Renormalization Group and the Cluster Perturbation Theory, we find that this model yields ferromagnetism at low energies.

        "original_text": "Turbulent flows are often characterized by the assumption of locality, where the kinematics and dynamics are largely separable in space and time. In this paradigm, fluid motion is decomposed into characteristic modes, or eddies, often arranged into quasi-regular structures such as shears, jets, and fronts. As an example, in compressible turbulence, these eddies often exhibit a hierarchical arrangement with large-scale structures such as filaments and clusters forming out of the eddies at smaller scales. This process is often characterized by a power-law scaling, where the size, velocity, density, and temperature of eddies at each scale are related to those at the next smaller scale through a characteristic scale factor. This phenomenon, known as multiscaling, implies a self-similar structure and has been observed to varying degrees of rigor in a range of physical systems. In this work, we present direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence at high resolution, focusing specifically on the nature of multiscaling in the scaling regime. We find that multiscaling is not as evident as in comparable experimental and Eulerian grid-based simulations, but is clearly present for a range of flow conditions. We posit that this is due to the evolution of multiscaling over time in compressible turbulence, where scaling relationships gradually break down as modes gradually separate through an increasing characteristic time scale. This process, known as intermittency, implies a negative scaling exponent and correspondingly flatter multiscaling exponents. We validate this hypothesis through the construction of a multifractal model, and demonstrate that the predicted intermittency leads to a breakdown of multiscaling as the flow transitions from steady to unsteady. This provides a useful framework for interpreting observations of multiscaling in turbulent flows, and has important implications for the dynamics of clusters in highly compressible turbulent flows such as those arising in the atmosphere and fusion plasma simulations.",

For the first time, we were able to detect quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) at 27.6 s and 60.4 mHz. The high frequency QPO is most likely a Keplerian frequency at the compact object s warped magnetosphere. The low frequency QPO could be a neutron star s frequency group.

The source has never been observed to be in both states at the same time. In the present data set, the source was observed to be in the hard state for almost the entire monitoring period, with only short periods of time in the soft state. The transitions between the different flux states as well as timing irregularities observed in the source s timing behavior could be the result of a changing geometry of the source s magnetic field.

These frequencies are similar in amplitude and frequency for each pulsator, with variations in peak separation, as well as varying pulsation amplitudes and phases. We posit that these pulsators represent different stages in the same evolutionary channel.

We categorize the solutions to these problems into two main categories: algorithms that optimize a single network objective, such as energy consumption or sum-throughput, and algorithms that optimize multiple objectives, such as energy consumption and fairness. We survey game-theoretic approaches to solve these resource allocation problems. A game is a mathematical model of conflict between rational agents that each prefer a different outcome. Game-theoretic solutions for resource allocation in wireless networks assign algorithmic agents (transmitters or receivers) to matchmaking roles that compete or collaborate to settle on a solution. We categorize game-theoretic approaches to wireless network resource allocation into two classes: 1) best-response algorithms that involve only searching through the agent’s own playbook for a best response; and 2) non-trivial algorithms that leverage the underlying game to improve the search for a best response.

High-pollution episodes (HPE) were defined as days with PM2.5 concentrations of over 300 μg/m3. HPEs accounted for 42% of the total days and were dominant during the warm seasons. HPEs had high AOD, high SO2, high NO2, and low wind speeds. Diagnostics of the dominated aerosol processes revealed that 61% of HPEs were related to secondary aerosol formation. 24% of HPEs were related to re-suspension, 11% to regional transport, and 5% to gas-phase chemical reactions. These processes were more active in winter, indicating the importance of wintertime transport in greater Tokyo. Analysis of the emission inventories showed that fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were the primary sources of SO2, NO2, and PM2.5.

They are classified in two categories based on the presence or absence of high-energy emission of whose particle accelerators is unknown. Observational data indicates that the emission is most likely originated near the black hole event horizon, although not all models are able to producing high-energy gamma-rays. Emission mechanisms in blazars are uncertain. A popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek process in which the magnetized central black hole powers the jet by extracting spin energy of the black hole. The original proposal had intended application to weak stellar magnetic fields, however subsequent studies suggest that the fields in blazars can be several orders of magnitude stronger. Another popular model is synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) in which synchrotron radiation up-scatters part of its own photons to high energy gamma-rays. Blazars often exhibit variability at all wavelengths on very short timescales, ranging from hours to days. Blazars are powerful emitters of radio waves, optical and gamma-rays and this electromagnetic radiation is highly variable. In this work we show that blazar jets are closely related to the inner regions of their associated accretion disks. Jets appear to be launched from tiny scale inner regions of the accretion disks and strong correlation is found between the magnitude of the disk scale height and the jet power. Such a correlation is expected in the Blandford-Znajek model and fits well the available data.

This structural phase transition is accompanied by a large change in electrical conductivity. It has been shown that the conductivity change can be explained by a change in carrier concentration caused by thermal excitation of deep trapping states. It has further been suggested that in order to describe the change in conductivity correctly, the distribution of activation energies of the deep trapping states has to be considered. The traditional method to obtain this distribution is the quasiequilibrium approximation (QEA), which is an assumption about the thermal evolution of the carrier concentration and requires a full description of the carrier diffusion. Here, we propose a method that relaxes the quasiequilibrium assumption and solves the coupled heat diffusion and drift-diffusion equations with the finite-element method. The obtained conductivity-temperature-relaxation-time-distribution function is in agreement with the quasiequilibrium approximation results for lattice temperatures below around 700 °C. For higher temperatures, however, the difference between the two approaches is considerable and increases with temperature.

It consists of an ensemble of non-interacting vortices, with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well-defined packets of each vortex sign. The vortices are self-similar and exhibit scale-invariance in the high-Cascade regime. In this paper, we develop a simplified 2D dynamical model that captures the essential features of the high-Cascade state. The evolution of the vorticity, Omega, is modeled by a diffusion equation with no-flux boundary conditions. Dissipation of enstrophy arises primarily through two distinct processes: direct viscosity, which leads to local smoothing of the vorticity field, and cross-helicity flux, which transfers enstrophy from near-core vortical zones to outer regions. We demonstrate that these two processes lead to a scaling solution with time-independent enstrophy and energy dissipation, in agreement with the dynamical model. We then show that the evolution of large-scale kinetic energy is controlled by the rate at which enstrophy is transferred to the outer regions. We derive an evolution equation for the scale-dependent enstrophy flux and perform a linear analysis to compute the scaling of the flux.

It consists of an ensemble of non - interacting vortices , with energy concentrated in enstrophy and well - defined packets of each vortex sign .The vortices are self - similar and undergo scale - invariance in the high - Cascade regime . In this paper , we develop a simplified 2D dynamical profile that captures the important features of the high - Cascade state .The evolution of the vorticity , Omega , is modeled by a diffusion equation with no - flux border conditions . Dissipation of enstrophy occurs principally through two different processes : direct viscosity , which results to local smoothing of the vorticity field , and cross - helicity flux , which moves enstrophy from near - core vortical zones to inner regions .We showed that these two mechanisms lead to a scaling solution with time - independent enstrophy and energy dissipation , in agreement with the dynamical theory . We then show that the evolution of large - scale kinetic power is controlled by the speed at which enstrophy is transferred to the exterior areas .We derive an evolution equation for the scale - dependent enstrophy flux and conduct a linear analysis to compute the scaling of the flux . This study , which neglects quadratic enstrophy - flux terms , makes good agreement with the full dynamical model in the high - Cascade regime .This effort was supported by the U . S .

We also calculate the cohomology with local coefficients in the standard representation in some special cases. Our study of cohomology groups with local coefficients enables us to solve a famous conjecture of Bass on the rank of 2-cohomology groups of arithmetic groups. More precisely, we prove that if the corresponding Zariski closure of an arithmetic group has no simple factors of exceptional type, then the rank of 2-cohomology group of this arithmetic group is divisible by 2 and by the constant part of itsbsd fixer. We also discuss the combinatorics of these cohomology groups with local coefficients, in particular the effect of the schensted correspondence on these cohomology groups. Finally, we give a new realization of the canonical mixed building of the special orthogonal group as a non-symmetric space, which enables us to calculate the cohomology of the special orthogonal group using the corresponding result for the orthogonal group. As a consequence, we give an alternative proof that the special orthogonal group has cohomological dimension 2. In this paper, all representations are complex representations.

The five stars were chosen because they span a range of effective temperatures and characterize a variety of surface field strengths. The majority of the sample exhibit predominantly radial fields with small-scale irregularities. Two stars, HD 485A and HD 37402, have dipole fields with stable emission cores.

        "original_text": "The abundance and size distributions of globular clusters (GCs) are key diagnostics of the formation processes of galaxies. GCs are primarily old, self-gravitating systems of stars, thus providing a fossil record of the star formation events that gave rise to their constituent members. As such, the GC systems (CGCS) of galaxies offer a valuable tool with which to study the formation and evolution of galaxies. We study the CGCSs of 13 massive, X-ray selected, optically dull galaxies (SDGs) with masses 1.3 - 4.5 x 10 11 M⊙, redshifts z = 0.02 - 0.33, and 13 - 105 Gyr of age using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/G band images. We find that 7 of these SDGs exhibit bimodal or multimodal GC systems. We compare our observational results with predictions of the classical early-major merger scenario, the delayed-merger scenario, and a novel merger-binary-spiral-component scenario. We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of pathways. At low redshift, these pathways included major mergers of comparable-sized galaxies, as well as more minor mergers and accretions. At high redshift, SDGs likely experienced more minor and major mergers, as well as purely dry minor mergers. However, we suggest that the late-stage mergers of gas-rich spiral galaxies formed the dense central GC systems of the SDGs. The lack of strong rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely reflects the gas-richness of these mergers. In this scenario, we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems, and we identify 3 such galaxies. Using our spatially resolved color data, we show that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate-age to old stellar populations, with the fraction of young stars increasing with distance from the center of the galaxy. We find that the spatial distribution of the GCs is more extended than that of the old stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii (average projected distances within which half of the GC system’s GCs are found) and power-law slopes consistent with the predictions of recent major merger and purely dry minor merger scenarios, respectively.

GCs are typically ancient , self - gravitating systems of stars , thus offering a fossil history of the star formation changes that gave rise to their constituent groups .As such , the GC systems ( CGCS ) of galaxies offer a crucial tool with which to study the formation and evolution of galaxies . We research the CGCSs of 13 massive , X - ray selected , optically dim galaxies ( SDGs ) with masses 1 . 3 - 4 . 5 x 10 11 [UNK] , redshifts z = 0 . 02 - 0 . 33 , and 13 - 105 Gyr of age use Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) WFC3 / G band images .We see that 7 of these SDGs exhibit bimodal or multimodal GC systems . We match our observational results with predictions of the classical early - major fusion scenario , the slow - merger scenario , and a novel separation - binary - spiral - component scenario .We argue that the SDGs likely formed through a variety of processes . At low redshift , these mechanisms involved major mergers of comparable - sized galaxies , as well as more minor mergers and accretions .At high redshift , SDGs typically experienced more minor and major mergers , as well as purely dry small mergers . However , we indicate that the late - phase mergers of gas - rich spiral clusters formed the deep central GC systems of the SDGs .The absence of high rotational support in the nuclei of these galaxies likely represents the gas - richness of these mergers . In this situation , we expect to find kinematic signatures of recent or ongoing major dry mergers in galaxies with predominantly diffuse GC systems , and we identify 3 such clusters .Using our spatially resolved color data , we find that both the SDGs and their constituent GCs have intermediate - age to old stellar groups , with the fraction of young galaxies increasing with distance from the hub of the galaxy . We see that the spatial spread of the GCs is more extended than that of the former stars and that the GC systems exhibit truncation radii ( actual estimated altitudes within which quarter of the GC system ’ s GCs are found ) and power - law slopes compatible with the estimates of recent major collision and purely dry small merger scenarios , respectively .We argue that this suggests that either a major fusion or a purely dry small merger has already occurred within the truncation radii of at least 5 galaxies .",

As an explicit example, we show that a brane world in six space-time dimensions with an adjoint scalar field, where the scalar develops a VEV along the space time direction can be constructed. The model presented has no discrete symmetries, and is hence potentially realistic. It provides a self sustaining late-time cosmology that can explain the near epoch expansion of the universe, and naturally generates small density inhomogeneities without the need for a cosmological inflationary period. Our model has a large number of arbitrary parameters, however we present a simple scenario in which all of these parameters are determined by a small number of parameters. The model is thus highly predictive. In particular, the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker brane give constraints on the scale of compactification of the extra-dimensions, and the scale of spontaneous Lorentz violation. We show that current experimental bounds on these scales may be able to be achieved in the framework of our model. Additionally, we investigate the realization of chiral fermions on the brane. In particular, we show that after the spontaneous Lorentz violation, right-chiral neutrinos and left-chiral antineutrinos can be localized to a single 4D spatial location, while right-chiral anti- neutrinos and left-chiral neutrinos remain delocalized over the extra-dimensions. Thus our model is not only realistic, but also solves the hot dark matter problem. Finally we discuss some of the cosmological implications of our work. In particular, we show that a 4D Friedmann equation can be obtained from our bulk theory. We present a scenario in which this dynamics, combined with the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe gives a natural explanation of the observed Hubble rate. The scenario we present is extremely simple, and has no free parameters. Moreover, it can potentially accommodate current observational constraints. This model is potentially testable in current and future experiments. Current experiments which may be able to test our model include MEG, PLANCK, and FOCUS. In the future, SHENGM7 may be able to test this scenario. Moreover, the exciting gravitational wave experiments, such as the LIGO and VIRGO, may also be able to test Lorentz invariance violation in the gravitational sector.

In this work, we extend the aforementioned study by systematically investigating the effect of the quadrupolar moment of the black holes on the evolution of the Carter constant. We find that for binaries with small quadrupoles, the evolution is qualitatively similar to the case with no quadrupolar moment. However, for larger quadrupoles, the evolution is no longer continuous and can result in divergent values of the constant. We demonstrate that this behavior can be understood in terms of a simple geometric argument based on the impact parameter of the binary system, and we show that a critical value of the quadrupolar moment can be identified above which the evolution of the constant becomes qualitatively different.

Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most violent explosions in the universe. However, their study is complicated by their unpredictable, randomly directed beams, making it difficult to precisely localize them. Short-lived and beamed Gamma-Ray Bursts with known cosmological redshifts provide a crucial opportunity for studying the nature of the universe and its structure. A majority of long GRBs have been observed with the Swift satellite, which provides not only rapid localization but also a wealth of multi-wavelength data. We have examined the spectral evolution of 57 Swift long GRBs with known redshifts, finding that three distinctly different regimes exist. The first regime is characterized by a cooling break followed by a simple power law. Between two and four dissipation slopes are observed in this regime. The second regime, seen in 17 bursts, is characterized by an initial thermal component with a blackbody function or a non-thermal tail, followed by a single power law. In the third and final regime, seen in 30 bursts, no identifiable spectral break is present and the spectra are well fit by a single power law. The cosmological models that best describe the observed burst data are curveduploads and a finite universe, with a probability of 68.3% and 95.7% respectively. This result is surprising because standard candle models assume that all bursts have the same intrinsic luminosity, which would result in a single power law across all regimes.

In this model, the amorphous solid is composed of particles interacting via a short-range, repulsive core and a long-range, attractive tail in a potential that is sheared, below the glass transition temperature, Tg, to generate an amorphous solid. In quasistatic deformation, regions of high shear stress,τ(shear), form from localized regions of high strain, e(loc), which propagate as wave fronts described by a strain localization theory. Specifically, a transition from spatially extended to localized strain is observed as the ratio of the localization length, λ, to the initial system length, L0, increases. An analytical theory describing the spatial, temporal, and frequency dependent shear modulus, G(τ,ω), and its relation to the shear stress and strain waveforms is developed, which allows for analysis of the frequency dependence of localized shear stress and strain, τ(loc)(ω) and e(loc)(ω). τ(loc) is observed to have three distinct regions with decay characteristic of critical exponents in scale-free space, increasing with frequency as 1/τ(loc)∼ω^{νz}, where ν=0.5 is the divergence of the correlation length, and α and β, which depend on details of the decay of the potential, describe the frequency dependence of the critical strain amplitude required to induce strain localization. e(loc) exhibits similar critical exponents to τ(loc) except with different critical amplitude exponents α=νz=1/2 and β=1/2. Furthermore, the critical exponents and scaling laws are compared to those of supercooled liquids (in which this model was originally proposed to explain) and those of amorphous solids with a different potential, demonstrating consistency between the predictions of the STZ model and these observations.

In order to avoid interfering with the primary spectrum user, the secondary cognitive radio transmitter has to adopt the rate adaptation to control its transmitting rate based on the interference received by the primary user, which is, however, unknown and difficult to observe. To this end, this paper proposes a non-Bayesian rate adaptation with two design approaches: one is the restless multi-armed bandit based approach for finding the unavailable spectrum in an automated and adaptive manner; the other is the Lyapunov optimization based approach for finding the operating point that achieves the worst average interference to the primary user. Specifically, the former adopts a large number of discrete channel states to approximate the dynamic and continuous interference levels, while the latter adapts the transmitting rate from a static to a dynamic mode according to the observation of the interference, and gradually converges to the operating point that achieves the worst average interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve near-optimal performance, in terms of both effective spectrum utilization and average interference to the primary user.",

To date, several diarylethene derivatives have been explored as building blocks to construct light-driven molecular devices. Generally, the photochromic diarylethene derivatives are regarded as the light-driven switching element and its associated molecular device is constructed by introduction of different electrodes. With the aim to explore more intrinsic switching behaviors of diarylethene derivatives, in this paper, we designed a novel molecular device in which a diarylethene unit is connected to two electrodes through a alkynylene spacer. The alkynylene spacer is very flexible and can undergo different cis-trans isomerization processes under light or darkness, which would produce different intermolecular forces between diarylethene derivatives and thus result in switching the electrical properties of the molecular devices.

In this Letter, we present a method for the synthesis of Taylor phase screens based on Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis functions. The approach combines ideas from optimisation and compensation. It consists of an optimisation problem that is non-convex and hard to solve in general, but can be approximated efficiently using an alternating method. The algorithm is validated on the synthesis of polynomial screens and an exponential screen. The synthesis of Taylor screens is a harder problem than synthesis of polynomial screens since it requires the synthesis of screens with rapidly changing phases. However, the proposed method synthesises Taylor screens with arbitrary smoothness and satisfies a natural physical constraint which guarantees the phase changes gradually. Balancing multiple objectives is a difficult problem in general. This is reflected by the fact that most heuristics for the synthesis of Taylor screens converge to a local optimum rather than the global optimum. In this Letter, we demonstrate how to tackle this problem using the KL method. We present a two-step method for initialisation and parameter identification. We show that the identified screens satisfy the physical constraints and have good approximation properties. We also propose a multi-start strategy that starts multiple algorithms for the synthesis of screens and combines the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two design examples and compare it with state of the art algorithms.",

CV, the measurement of current as a function of voltage, is the main method used to investigate electrochemical phenomena. The traditional approach to CV measurements is to slowly increase the voltage from an initial value of 0 until an asymptotic value is reached where the electrochemical system has progressed through one full reaction. This standard approach, known as linear CV, has several shortcomings when characterizing electrochemical phase transitions. In some cases a phase change occurs but not complete reduction or oxidation of the system. This incomplete reduction or oxidation means that the system has not reached an equilibrium composition. The traditional linear CV approach does not report whether the system has reached equilibrium composition. Another shortcoming of the linear approach is that only one voltage value is reported even though multiple phases may be present at different voltage. This work develops a new approach to CV measurement, called E-C FORC, which tracks the voltage path the system takes as it progresses through multiple phases and reaches equilibrium. Using a genetic algorithm E-C FORC is able to determine both the path the system takes as it transitions between phases and the voltage corresponding to equilibrium composition. The technique is demonstrated using ferricyanide as a model electrochemical system. E-C FORC is able to determine the equilibrium composition in both highly polyphasic systems and those with very sharp phase transitions.

Historical estimates of the star s distance have varied considerably, from under 4 pc to over 14 pc, and recent high-precision parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite gave a distance of 11.65 pc. IUE spectra of the Epsilon Aurigae system showed Balmer emission from the primary star, although its spectrum was dominated by that of the secondary.

Traditionally, network coding has been shown to improve spectral efficiency without increasing the diversity order, however, many networks require both high spectral efficiency and high diversity order. In this paper, we show that network coding with multiuser detection (MUD) can achieve both high spectral efficiency and high diversity order. We present a cooperative transmission protocol which leverages network coding and MUD to achieve high spectral efficiency and high diversity simultaneously. We analyze the protocol using the degree of freedom (DoF) framework and present a closed form approximation for the symmetric case. Through simulations, we show that the spectral efficiency and diversity achieved by the proposed protocol are significantly higher than both Network Coding with Max-Ratio Combining (MRC) and Network Coding with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). In addition, we show that the protocol is very effective at maximizing the throughput of non-colluding nodes in a network.",

We prove that the nonholonomic Ricci flow, whose  potential  is the squared of the unique M-curvature, is equivalent to the nonholonomic flow envelope (NFE) for the class of vacuum Einstein equations with anholonomic variables. It means that solutions of the considered equations for the M-curvature define the same solutions of the nonholonomic Ricci flow. We prove that the considered vacuum Einstein equations with anholonomic variables define the Riemann geometry, which never Ricci flows, but only nonholonomic Ricci flows. We find the formulas for variation of some geometric objects, defining the induced nonholonomic distribution and nonlinear connection (ND) in the corresponding deformations. Such formulas can be used for redefinition of the solution parameters for generating new families of solutions by such nonholonomic deformations. We show that such formal transformations are not uniquely defined and there are some some solutions, which cannot be transformed into each other by such nonholonomic formal parameter transformations. The Abelian and non-Abelian conservation laws for the nonholonomic Ricci flows are found.

The simplest spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell system contains two independent functions of radial coordinate only. However, these can be reduced further to a single quadrature, allowing exact solutions to be obtained in several special cases. In general, the presence of the Maxwell field contributes one additional conserved charge, the masshair  of the solution. For some choices of the equations of state of the plasma, explicit solutions can be obtained in different regions of the spacetime. The resulting space-times describe either black holes with a gravitational mass, a scalar field hair, or naked singularities, depending on the choice of equations of state. In this paper, we present a systematic method to generate analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system with a spherically symmetric plasma. This is achieved by relating the system to a theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to a non-linear scalar field. We then use a series expansion about the centres of symmetry of the solution, and a number of analytic solutions to the non-linear theory in Newtonian gravity to construct the full solution. We apply our general procedure to several specific cases, obtaining new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system, and discussing their properties. In particular, we show how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair. Our approach has some similarity to the AdS-CFT correspondence, which relates the gravitational description of some strongly coupled plasmas to a lower-dimensional gauge theory. In this respect, the gravitational collapse of charged matter described above may be interpreted as a phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theory, with the black hole forming when the gauge theory approaches a large-$N$ limit in which gravity is strongly interacting, and the naked singularity forming when the gauge theory undergoes a large-$N$ transition to a low-energy weakly coupled plasma. This paper provides a rare example of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system. More generally, it shows how the addition of a Maxwell field changes the possible outcomes of gravitational collapse, from black hole formation with no scalar hair to the formation of naked singularities with scalar hair.

The model, referred to as 1-layer Excitable CNN (ECC), only consists of a single layer of 1D CNN, with the convolution filters shaped in a particular fashion so as to excitable. Unlike existing 2D path curve approximation methods that typically require multiple layers of convolutions and nonlinearities, ECC only requires a single 1D CNN layer. We show that the 1D filters in the 1st layer of ECC are actually hyperbolic tangent functions (HTF) and that by proper initializations, the 1D representations of different 2D path curves generated from ECC all collapsed into a single 1D band after a few singular value decompositions (SVDs). Through carefully studying the SVD factors, we are able to identify the number of factors to equal the number of path points in a path, and thus ECC can be viewed as a dynamic lower dimensional Hankel matrix completion method. We further propose a path evolution strategy to use this implicit representation to generate 2D path curves, achieving smooth path evolution and thus path curvature. We demonstrate that 1-layer ECC is capable of approximating complex path curves with high fidelity, even those with very thin or sharp turns. We show that ECC, with its single layer representation, is much more efficient and has much less parameters than existing 2D path curve approximation methods. We also conduct thorough experiments to analyze the influences of various factors on the path curve approximation performance of ECC. With the 1-layer ECC model and the path evolution strategy, we build an automatic path approximation pipeline which is easy to train and robust to various path types.

Furthermore, we show that our classification has direct physical interpretations, connecting the different classes to different phases, including solid, smectic, nematic, and cluster phases. As an example, we apply our classification to the rich phase diagram of the easy-plane anisotropic Heisenberg model, where our analysis explains recent numerical work on the nature of cluster phases. Overall, our classification provides a natural way to organize clusters in condensed phases according to the phase in which they occur. This will be of great utility for understanding phase diagrams and for capturing phase coexistence.",

Such studies are typically performed at high redshifts, using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from young stars. Because the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) varies with the type of stars and their age, the SFR can be measured by fitting the FUV emission with population synthesis models. This permits studies of star formation over the past 8-15 billion years, but the accuracy is limited by our poor knowledge of the SFH over much shorter timescales. Here we present an analysis of recent data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) that provides an accurate measurement of the SFR over the past 3 billion years, based on the luminosity of Ly-alpha radiation from young, cool stars. Unlike FUV radiation, this  visible  light varies with the instantaneous rate of star formation, making it a  flashing light  tracer of current SFR. Using our analysis techniques, we find a current SFR of 5.9 (± 2.3) × 10−3 solar masses per year in the local universe, 90% of which occurred in the past 3 Gyr. By comparing this with an older (13.7 billion year) estimate based on the evolution of the solar system s gold content, we conclude that the current SFR in the local universe is comparable to that of the last several billion years. These results provide crucial new constraints for models of star and galaxy formation in the universe.",

The current leading survey to discover thousands of SNe Ia is the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Search (SNLS), which is targeting 7.5 deg2 area in distant Universe  1 . With the discovery of SNe Ia at such high redshifts, it will be possible to measure the dark energy properties with unprecedented precision. The LSST, which is projected to discover tens of thousands of SNe Ia in 10 square degrees by 2021, is expected to dramatically improve the measurement of the dark energy parameters  2, 3 . To achieve the optimal science return from these future surveys, it is essential to measure the structure growth rate from redshift 7.5 to 10 accurately. This requires much larger galaxy surveys in the near-infrared (NIR), and breaking the *visibility period gap with NIR galaxy surveys has become a high priority for SN cosmology research. In this work, we measure the galaxy clustering rate using BOSS DR12 galaxy samples in three non-overlapping regions of the LSST visible footprint, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 by testing the impact of systematics from the light-to-number count relation. We find that the uncertainty from this relation is smaller than 0.5% in wavenumber space, and the bispectrum information beyond the nonlinear scale can be exploited to further reduce the uncertainty to 0.1%. We forecast the uncertainty from using BOSS DR12 in the LSST full footprint by combining three regions with these NIR constraints, and find that the galaxy clustering measurements will achieve 1% precision at nonlinear scales (0.2% at one eighth of the nonlinear scale) in the dark energy analysis with only 25% more galaxies than the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. We also show that combining the BOSS DR12 clustering measurements with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the planned SPHERIC power spectrum measurement can significantly tighten the dark energy constraints, and the parameter errors can be decreased by a factor of two compared to using the BOSS DR12 clustering measurement alone. The measurement from BOSS DR12 can be completed by 2021, and the full LSST NIR clustering measurement will be achieved in 2023. The NIR galaxy clustering measurement from BOSS DR12 will provide strong synergy to the optical SN Ia measurement from the LSST, and significantly improve the dark energy measurement with the next generation cosmological surveys.

The models suggest the existence of at least three successive adiabatic shocks, two associated with the bullets observed moving away from the origin and the third occurring some time after April 2006 when the brightness of the system began to fall. Within the framework of this one-zone model, the evolution of the emitting zone is well- approximated by an exponential law, with a velocity equal to the escape speed from the shocked region. The density at the centre of the shocked region is found to be consistent with the minimum central density implied by the bolometric luminosity and the average expansion velocity. We also show that the steepening of the radial density profile observed in the last observation of 2006 October 22 can be reproduced by the model if the shockwave has reached the surface of the star.

For example, isolated NS form by the isolated formation of the NS core followed by a supernova explosion, whereas binary NS form via a binary star merger. In this work, we report the first detection of a double NS (DNS) system that can be utilized to distinguish between the two formation channels. We find that the DNS system in M22 has a median period of P=7.1days and an e-folding timescale of τF=1.8 Myr for the accretion rate of 2.1×10-9M⊙s-1, which are consistent with predictions from isolated NS formation. In contrast, the DNS system in NGC6440 has a longer period of P=14.2h and an e-folding timescale of τF=4.4 Myr for the accretion rate of 4.2×10-9M⊙s-1, which are consistent with predictions from binary NS formation. We find that both DNS systems have low, relatively constant X-ray luminosities (L_X∼1031-1033 erg s−1). These X-ray properties are also consistent with the predictions from binary NS formation. Our analysis suggests that the DNS system in M22 formed via isolated NS formation, whereas the DNS system in NGC6440 formed via binary NS formation.

Their existence was predicted in 1664 by Johann-Heinrich Schroter, and the first such object was identified in 1801. TNOs are considered a key testbed for theories of planet formation, as their current orbit distribution provides evidence of the processes by which the Solar System evolved over time. Recent high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed that a significant fraction of TNOs are in fact in compact multiple systems. This fraction is particularly high for larger TNOs, with about 15% of 2499+ objects with diameter >50 km being in multiple systems, and as many as one third of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with a diameter of 100 km or more being part of multiple systems. Although many of these observed companions are likely remnants of shattered embryonic asteroids, several systems with centaurs, comets, and classical Kuiper belt objects are also clearly identified. Chaos-assisted capture (CAC) has been proposed as a mechanism to form these companions through resonant interactions with the giant planets, but recent theoretical work suggests that resonant capture may not be sufficient to explain the existence of so many multi-chained systems. In this paper, we propose another mechanism by which TNOs in the trans-Neptunian region could have been members of multiple systems: fission. We show that the sudden merger of two SDOs in a near-contact configuration can lead to the formation of a third SDO thanks to an instability that creates an additional gravitational torque. This mechanism, which we dub chaos-assisted fission, has the advantage of explaining the high observed fraction of binary TNOs without the need for planets to be responsible for their origin. We show that this dynamical process is likely to occur frequently in the trans-Neptunian region, especially during close encounters. By conducting a series of N-body simulations, we show that the instability that creates a new companion tends to occur for SDOs with a diameter of 100-150 km that are dynamically caught in an inward migration region between 35 and 40 au. For the conditions typically found in the trans-Neptunian region, the instability occurs more frequently for SDOs with an initial orbital radius of 30 au than for those with an initial orbital radius of 50 au.

The Hartree-Fock method, proposed by Paul Hartree and Robert F. Service  1  and later developed by Robert Marshak  2 , was the first SCF method and remains widely used. In this technique, the system is approximated as a collection of non-interacting electrons, or, more accurately, a set of orthogonal orbitals, called Slater determinants, that describe the system. TheHartree-Fock equation, wherein the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals, is then iterated to self-consistency, that is, to a solution in which the orbitals do not change between iterations. Several generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method have since been developed. The coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF) method, proposed by Gilbert  3  and developed by Freeman and Subbaswamy  4 , is one such generalization. In this approach, the orbitals are allowed to change between iterations, and the energy is still expressed as a functional of the orbitals. However, the functional is approximated by the sum of the Hartree energy and a Fock energy expressed as a functional of the orbitals. Variational iterated perturbation theory (VIPT) is a similar generalization, proposed by Edward  5  and developed by Hyberts and Wood  6 . VIPT also represents the energy as a functional of the orbitals, but differs from CPHF in the manner by which the functional is approximated. The energy is expressed as a sum of a Hartree energy and a  free-energy  functional, which involves only perturbation theory within a given order. Variational perturbation theory (VPT) is another generalization of the Hartree-Fock method. It is based on a similar functional, but the functional is minimized with respect to the orbitals, as opposed to being treated as a fixed parameter. All of these generalizations of the Hartree-Fock method share the feature that the energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the orbitals. This review focuses on the development of the Hartree-Fock SCF method, as well as some of its generalizations, over the past few decades. We begin with a detailed description of the original method, outlining the various approximations that underlie its derivation. Next, several variants of the method are described.

In particular, inequalities for the joint entropy of dependent random variables are obtained. The novel inequalities are employed to derive vector formulations of well known entropy power and complementary entropy relations in information theory. The new results provide a theoretical framework for estimation-theoretic characterizations of entropy power, entropy rate, and conditional entropy, and related quantities. The inequalities are relevant to theories of multivariate dependence and have potential applications in mathematics, information theory, and statistics. Here is an excerpt from the paper: A remarkable property of entropy is its monotonicity under statistical mechanisms. For example, if two random vectors are statistically independent, then their entropies add. More generally, if statistical mechanisms transform into , their entropies increase. The entropy power inequality (EPI) and the entropy rate (ER) entropy power inequality are fundamental and well known results in information theory. The former states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the sum of the entropies of its components, while the latter states that the entropy of a random vector cannot be greater than the entropy of its mean. Both these inequalities hold for any random vectors. Here we present information-theoretic proofs of the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. Our starting point is the information inequality (FI), which gives a lower bound on the mutual information. Under suitable conditions, we obtain a new family of information inequalities, which imply the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. We demonstrate the use of these general inequalities through vector forms of fundamental entropy power and entropy rate relations. The inequalities presented here complement existing approaches to proving the entropy power and entropy rate entropy power inequalities. These include information-theoretic proofs based on Young’s inequality, probability distributions and sufficiency. In this paper we also present information-theoretic proofs of some related entropy inequalities, including relations for the conditional entropy and the joint entropy of dependent random variables. We observe that the proofs are unchanged if joint distributions are replaced with distribution functions. The new results presented here have several important applications, including to theories of multivariate dependence, mathematics, information theory and statistics. For example, the new results are used to obtain a vector entropy power inequality for statistically dependent random variables, an application that has received considerable attention in the information theory literature but which has not previously been available via an information-theoretic approach. Another application of our results is to obtain a vector entropy rate inequality for time series. We also prove a vector joint entropy power inequality.

Cluster radio galaxies (CRG), namely radio-loud AGN located in the cluster core, show signs of ongoing strong activity that are usually absent in field galaxies.

Cluster cold fronts, for instance, appear frequently in simulations of clusters in the intermediate stages of formation, but hardly ever in actual X-ray observations. This suggests that the fraction of active CRG could be different from what predicted by these scenarios. Observations of the soft X-ray emission from CRG counterparts also suggest the presence of large amounts of hot gas associated with the CRG, likely stripped from the cluster galaxies. Finally, observations of the large scale structure surrounding clusters suggest that most of them grow through the accretion of mass-poorer groups.

An application to a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H<0.5 is given to demonstrate the proposed method. Our proposed test is based on the maximum likelihood estimator of the Hurst parameter, and the LSEE for the underlying diffusion process is derived.

For example, it was observed that certain physical systems, such as earthquakes and wind gusts, exhibit long-range power-law correlations that are similar in form to fBm. As a consequence, methods for testing for fBm have found use in a wide range of areas, including financial market analysis, human activity analysis, astrophysics, and geophysics. On the other hand, there are many scenarios in which it is desired to test the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is either fBm or an alternative process. As a typical example, when analyzing empirical data, one may suspect that the sample paths exhibit fBm behavior for some time periods, but then exhibit a different behavior for other time periods. It is therefore of interest to have a statistical test for determining whether a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm or an alternative. Such a test should be reliable (have accurate size control) and have power approaching one. The test that is most closely related to the present work was proposed in  5 . There, the hypothesis that a sample path of a stochastic process is fBm was tested using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Hurst parameter, and the LSEE was used to approximate the sample path. Under some regularity conditions, it was shown that the test had correct size and that its power approached one. The primary drawback of this approach is that the regularity conditions were very restrictive, and it was therefore difficult to extend this approach to more general settings.

The efficiency of KS scheme relies on the choice of the approximate electron-electron interaction. For strong interaction, one has to use more elaborate KS-potential, which is numerically expensive. One of the efficient and low-cost approximations for the KS potential is the so-called exact exchange (EX) potential. This potential is constructed as a functional derivative of the exact exchange energy with respect to the electron density. The density obtained from the KS equations with the EX potential as a part of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is very close to the actual one. However, the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS-potential yields a very large gap in the excitation spectrum, which does not correspond to the experimentally observed excitability of the systems. This discrepancy is referred to as the paradox of the correlated electrons. It was shown by Vydrov and Scuseria in 2008 that the gap in the excitation spectrum of the KS system with the EX potential can be made closer to the experimental one by introducing an artificial dependence of the potential on density, which they called the non-local dependence (NLD). In this work we show that the existence of NLD in KS potential is a consequence of the fact that it is obtained as a solution of the KS equations with the XC potential containing a non-local term. The non-local term appears due to the dependence of the Fock operator on the electron density. We derive the formula for the NLD term that takes this into account. We present the KS equations with the new XC potential and prove that the solutions of the equations coincide with those with the potentials used before and with the KS equation with the EX potential as the KS potential. This solution eliminates the gap in the excitation spectrum and reconciles the correlated electron systems described by the KS scheme with the Exact exchange potential and the Fock operator with the reasonable density dependence of the Coulomb potential.",

This zero-temperature phase is characterized by a non-zero value of the chirality Edwards-Anderson order parameter θ_{EA}, as well as a non-zero amplitude A_{chiral} of the chiral spiraling correlations, which decay algebraically with distance. Both θ_{EA} and A_{chiral} are computed via efficient genetic algorithms, embedded within the standard replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm. Our findings suggest the possible existence of a discontinuous phase transition to a disorder-dominated phase at nonzero temperature. The direct calculation of θ_{EA} and A_{chiral} has not been possible so far in two dimensions, owing to the extreme computational cost of existing exact techniques. Our genetic algorithms yield the first estimates of θ_{EA} and A_{chiral}, and of the chiral glass exponent z=2.21(4). We expect that similar techniques will allow us to prove the existence of this phase and of its associated critical exponents, as well as of its continuum limit, in the general case of d dimensions and general lattice models of correlated electrons. The chirality is a discrete, global degree of freedom that has not been taken into account so far in spin glass models. It is a (net) rotation angle of the spin structure (e.g. left or right spin). As the spins are coupled in pairs in the standard XY model, it is natural to consider the chirality of each spin separately. Chirality appears as a local order parameter in models with discrete degrees of freedom. In equilibrium statistical physics, the chirality is a useful tool to detect spin glass order. For classical spin glasses, the chirality behaves in many ways as an ordinary spin (in a random Ising magnet, the chirality only distinguishes up and down spins). The XY spin glass is a classical, random spin model. The chirality can also be seen as a discrete, global order parameter in XY models. In continuum models, its detection via usual equilibrium tools (e.g. correlation functions) is impossible because of the critical character of the transition: long range order is absent at criticality. However, we found that, in the XY model on a lattice, chirality spontaneously appears at zero temperature, with very good accuracy. It would be interesting to prove this zero temperature chirality in the continuum limit. The chirality degree of freedom appears also in certain low temperature phases of higher dimensions and different lattice models (e.g. Heisenberg and Potts models). The",

These quasars can be observed over a broad range of distances from the host galaxy, corresponding to various stages in the growth of the black hole, and are valuable tools for understanding how black holes and their host galaxies form and evolve. Using a large cluster catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 11, we select a sample of 43 quasars at a redshift of 0.3 < z < 2.6 that are located in the projected vicinity of a cluster, with a projected separation of less than 1 Mpc. We compare the radial distribution of these quasars to that of a control sample of 43 matched quasars at similar redshifts that are not in the vicinity of a cluster. We use a maximum likelihood method to fit for the mean separation between quasars and their host clusters, and find no significant radial offset between the two samples. We conclude that quasars do not preferentially reside in the centers of their clusters, and that any preference for quasars to be found near the centers of clusters is less than 5% at the 99% confidence level. These results are consistent with previous studies that have either examined significantly smaller samples of quasars, or have not separated quasars into central and satellite galaxies.

Recent developments in network science and complex systems have provided new insights into these networks. A fundamental framework for studying these networks is the complex network framework, where nodes represent objects and links model interactions between objects. This framework has been applied to study networks of scientific collaborations, protein interaction networks and neural networks. The dynamical systems point of view of networks has also proven to be powerful. In this framework, nodes and links are represented by dynamical systems.

The OH and NH2 anti-solvent refrigeration technique was used to produce samples of nitrous oxide in diethyl ether solution. A range of data analysis methods were used to analyse the spectra, and it was found that the global minimum nitrous oxide conformer in solution has a gamma-proton resonance as a single hydrogen bond and a symmetric CH2O hydrogen bond between the two molecules. This is in contrast to the vapour, where the global minimum has two strong NH...O hydrogen bonds, leading to the resonance form. The reorganisation energy of the gamma-proton resonance in solution is 18 cm-1, very close to the value in the gas phase. The calculated am1g-frequencies for the two strongest NH...O and gamma-proton hydrogen bonds are 3650 and 3300 cm-1 respectively, and are found in the infrared spectrum at 3520 and 3220 cm-1 respectively. The calculated lifetime of the gamma-proton hydrogen bond in solution is 44 ps, and is found from the linewidth of the frequency range corresponding to this hydrogen bond, which is 10 cm-1. The linewidth is used to calculate the vibrational lifetime of the nitrous oxide solution molecules. The nitrous oxide solution has a weaker gamma-proton hydrogen bond than in the gas phase or other solution conformers, and this has been proposed to be one of the causes of the strong inversion, general anaesthesia, produced by inhalation of the solution. The gamma-proton hydrogen bond in solution has a lifetime which is less than that in the gas phase or other solution conformers, and this has implications for the theory of general anaesthesia produced by inhalation of nitrous oxide solution. The nitrous oxide spectrum in solution has been found to be in good agreement with previous gas phase studies, with a combination of methods for analysing IR spectra. The global minimum nitrous oxide solution conformer has a much lower energy than the observed gamma-proton resonance form in the gas phase, and this may be one of the reasons why general anaesthesia is only produced by inhalation of the gas form. The results could be relevant to understanding nitrous oxide general anaesthesia, and the differences could be used to characterise solvents and correlate with trends in anaesthetic potency.",

In the standard rulers and clocks (SCR) approximation, the LSS forms a light cone due to the recession velocity of the galaxy or the sound speed of the baryon field2. Using the LSS as a natural ruler and clock, we can measure the geodesic distance and the expansion rate of the light cone respectively. In this way, the LSS provides a unique test bed to study gravity in an highly anisotropic universe3. Recent observations of the LSS show that the universe is dominanted by dark energy with 73.8% of the total energy density4, while the density of matter is only 26.2%. This result is known as the cosmic acceleration. The nature of dark energy is one of the most important open questions in fundamental physics and astronomy. Since the equation of state (EOS) of dark energy strongly correlates with the expansion history of the universe, a precise measurement of dark energy EOS can be achieved by using the LSS as a natural ruler. In this work, we build a model-independent LSS statistic by measuring the anisotropic multipoles of the LSS. By using a cubic-mapping formula to interpolate the LSS in simulations, we measure the multipoles up to the order of 10 in the anisotropic case. To test the efficacy of this statistic, we apply it to the most precise simulation produced by the IllustrisTNG project. We find that the measurement of the first two anisotropic multipoles can break the degeneracy between the EOS and the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN). Furthermore, the ratio of the first two multipoles is independent of the bias between the LSS and the dark matter. Therefore, this LSS statistic provides a promising method to study gravity and shed light on the nature of dark energy.",

Historically, it was thought that these outflows were powered solely by energy lost by stretching of the GRB jet, which launches at nearly the speed of light. However, we demonstrate that collimated outflows can also be powered by baryon-loaded winds from a magnetar, and that the majority of observed GRB central engines are spinning down rapidly via this mechanism. If enough energy is coupled to the winds, then the outflow is mildly relativistic (Gamma > 2). The combination of baryon-loaded magnetar winds and ultra-relativistic jets remains a viable model for the observed diversity of long-duration GRBs. A rapidly-rotating neutron star (NS) known as a magnetar is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). During a GRB, the surface of the magnetar may emit gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, which could power a cosmological population of highly-relativistic jets, in addition to baryonic winds. While some baryonic-wind models produce mildly-relativistic jets that could account for some of the diversity of long-duration GRBs, these models tend to over-predict the amount of energy that can be extracted from the central NS. We demonstrate that a better coupling of magnetar energy to baryonic outflows via neutrino annihilation or Poynting flux can solve this problem. In particular, we consider a combination of a baryonic wind from a magnetar with a mildly-relativistic jet, and find that the total energy coupled to the winds can account for the majority of long GRBs.

        "original_text": "Single point mutations (SPMs) in protein sequences have long been of interest to biologists and engineers, due to their capability to affect protein stability and function. Historically, SPMs have been characterized with binary classification approaches, whereby proteins are classified as either stable or unstable based on some SPM-specific stability metric. While this metric-based approach has been useful, it has several limitations, including: i) the metric must be pre-calculated for the SPM of interest; ii) the metric typically analyzes the entire protein sequence rather than individual sites of the protein, and therefore loses site-specific information; and iii) the metric is based on an abstract protein representation, making the interpretation of stability changes difficult. Recently, a new SPM characterization paradigm has emerged, known as  energy decomposition analysis . In essence, this method first characterizes the wild-type protein with a high-level method like molecular mechanics energy decomposition analysis (MM-EDA). For each SPM, the method then decomposes the total energy difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins into residue-level contributions. This method allows us to capture site-specific contributions of the mutant and wild-type proteins, and therefore may be a better tool for understanding the stability impacts of SPMs. We tested this paradigm on the recently published CO-BRASS data set (1). In this dataset, the authors experimentally characterized the effects of 402 alanine mutations in flavodoxin (a 7.3 kD protein). Each mutation was examined in both the oxidizing (oxidized) and non-oxidizing (reduced) states. The authors determined that 220 mutations resulted in significant stability changes. Using the energy decomposition method, we were able to accurately predict whether a SPM would impact stability (i.e. be positive or negative). As shown in Table 1, we were able to achieve 91% accuracy on the test set. Although not particularly impressive, this level of performance is significant given that no feature engineering was done, and no additional data (e.g. structural information) was utilized.

We identify DM halos in this large volume simulation using a technique combining friends-of-friends (FOF) with a high-order multivariate filter and characterize their inner structure using the radial distribution of their DM and substructure (stellar and gaseous) components. We find that at all masses, DM halos can be cleanly separated into two primary structural components: a relatively smoothly distributed  central  region and a more clumpy  substructure  component which comprises a distinct secondary distribution having an asymptotic power-law slope of -3. The fraction of substructure within a halo, and the power-law slope of its structural distribution, are both significantly correlated with the halo s maximum identified gravitational attraction: the more substructure a halo has, the stronger its central gravitational pull. We refer to these two distinct structural components as the  core  and  fossil  distributions, respectively, and suggest that fossil groups, comprising a halo with a significant fraction of central substructure, may be identified by an algorithm combining the FOF halo-finder with the inverse of this power-law slope. We apply our algorithm to a selection of clusters and groups from the Bolshoi simulation, finding that, while the scheme correctly classifies most clusters as fossil or non-fossil groups, it fails to identify some fossil groups with diffuse stellar components and halos having shallower central cusp slopes.

A group is a set of transformations, with an identity, that can be composed with one another. In this sense, the Lorentz transformations express how things change with velocity. In particular, if one knows the velocity of an object, one can use the Lorentz transformations to find how it changes with time. In turn, this allows one to find the spatial transformation. This article shows that, although the Lorentz transformations were introduced a very long time ago, they can still provide useful lessons for how to approach mathematics and physics. In particular, it discusses the finding that it is useful to distinguish between first and second order equations in physics. The article then explores the origins of the Lorentz transformations and shows that they can be derived from more general transformations, which in turn can be derived from the requirement that certain laws of physics should not change over time. From this more general perspective, the Lorentz transformations can be considered a specific case, whose use can lead to confusion. The article then considers an example from special relativity of a person measuring the speed of light in two different inertial frames of reference. It is shown that this requires one to consider both the spatial and the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations, as the speed of light is a function of both. In this example, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations can be interpreted as a change of reference frame, which alters the rate at which clocks in the different reference frames move with respect to each other. From this, the authors find that if one specifies the spatial transformation between the two reference frames, one can in turn find the temporal transformation. In the second part of the article, the example is generalised to two inertial reference frames that move with respect to one another, leading to a situation called the Relativistic Doppler effect. This again requires the consideration of both the spatial and temporal components of the Lorentz transformations. The article then considers the situation in which the observers in the two reference frames agree that light should travel with a fixed speed, and that this should remain true regardless of their motion with respect to one another. In this case, the temporal component of the Lorentz transformations reduces to a simpler transformation rule for the light’s frequency, which can then be interpreted as a standard way to compare the observers’ own reference frames when they move with respect to one another.",

A strong R-matrix is a non-linear operator that, together with a related linear operator (the S-matrix), yields an associative product that defines a finite-dimensional non-commutative ring with unity, known as a finite braided commutative algebra (FBCA). In this work we describe computation of R-matrices for eight binary QC codes using the RIME framework. We use the abelian setting where the S-matrix is a diagonal matrix to compute R-matrices that are also diagonal, and give examples of non-abelian R-matrices for the same codes. We discuss how the R-matrices interact with RIME to establish ideal lattices for each of the codes. The eight codes we study are optimal two-level codes, two-level extended Hamming codes, and five four-level codes commonly used in surface-code quantum computing. Our computed R-matrices have many nice properties, including compatibility with the abelian setting and simple structure when viewed as a lattice over the real numbers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. In particular, we describe the case where the R-matrix is a real diagonal matrix as a families of real numbers (depending on several parameters) where each number occurs with multiplicity one and each occurs exactly twice. We also show how to compute R-matrices corresponding to non-abelian structures when the S-matrix is diagonal. The RIME framework for computing R-matrices in the abelian setting makes use of an appropriately modified quantum chess problem, the Hamilton Pfaffian QC-polynomial. In particular, each symmetry of the chess problem corresponds to a permutation matrix in the R-matrix, and these permutations satisfy a precise lattice-theoretical restriction. In the non-abelian case, no analogous check for R-matrix structure appears to be known, so alternative techniques must be used to establish non-abelian R-matrices. In this work, we describe a non-abelian RIME framework that similarly uses a modified Hamilton Pfaffian but with the permutations no longer required to satisfy a lattice-theoretical restriction. Instead, an ad-hoc method for establishing non-abelianity is used. Finally, we present a few experiments using RIME to establish security of communication over common communication channels (such as WiFi or cell-phone networks). We show that our computed R-matrices are strong and that ideal lattices produced using the R-matrices are the best lattice-based schemes we can find for each of the codes we study.

In this work, we performed multi-wavelength observations of BL Lacertae in the optical band over a period of 12 years.

In this work, we show that high-energy particles produced by pulsars and active galaxies can have a significant effect on the formation of the first stars and galaxies. We performed detailed calculations of the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars in minihalos subject to the combined effect of the photoelectric effect and ionization, as well as the pair production and photon pressure exerted by high-energy particles. We find that the mean free path of low-energy particles is much larger than the size of the minihalos, and thus the effect of cosmic rays is to induce local variations in the density and temperature but has no global effect. We also estimate the effect of cosmic rays on the formation of the first low-mass galaxies. At the end of the simulations, we calculate the expected fraction of metals produced by Pop III stars. We find that the presence of cosmic rays can increase this fraction by up to one order of magnitude in the most favorable conditions. We discuss the conditions under which this process can lead to the early transition from Pop III to Pop II star formation.",

In this study, we exploit the unique capabilities of the combined GOODS and CANDELS multiwavelength dataset to study the physical processes active in the most massive galaxies at these early epochs. We find that the dominant mode of star formation at these redshifts is quiescent, dry merging, in contrast to popular expectation based on studies of local galaxies3. More quantitatively, we find a continuous increase in the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present day, with corresponding decreases in the ratio of recent to past-average star formation rate and galaxy size. We show that these trends cannot be easily reconciled with a model in which star formation in these galaxies is uniformly delayed until the present day, without otherwise changing their evolution. We conclude that the dominant process setting the star formation rate in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts is distinct from that in present-day galaxies. We show that while this mode of star formation is inefficient, it drives the growth of the massive galaxies we observe in the local universe. We show that this growth is also non-uniform, with massive galaxies growing by accretion of both companions and smooth ( dry ) mergers with similar fractional contributions from each. This growth through dry merging is sufficient to explain the observed size evolution of massive galaxies. This picture also naturally explains the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation: as galaxies continue to grow by dry merging, the growth of the brightest central regions is quicker than that of the outskirts. These results may help to explain several long-standing puzzles about the early growth of massive galaxies. In particular, they suggest that present-day elliptical galaxies grew largely by dry merging throughout much of their lifetimes, a conclusion which may help explain the observed correlation between galaxy structure and star formation. They further imply that massive galaxies at high redshift were not predominantly  downsizing 3-5 in their star formation, as would be implied by the extended periods of intense star formation observed in some high-redshift galaxies6-8. Instead, we suggest that observed differences in the physical processes and rates of star formation in present-day massive galaxies and those in the most massive galaxies at these high redshifts may instead be driven by the much longer timescales since the peak of most recent dry merging. While the details of these differences are still subject to considerable debate, our results point to the importance of the early growth of massive galaxies via dry merging, perhaps even preceding the  monumental  merger class, in explaining the present-day galaxy populations we observe.",
