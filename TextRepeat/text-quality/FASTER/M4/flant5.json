INTRODUCTORY REMARK\nThe critical Casimir effect  1  , i.e., the force acting between macroscopic bodies due to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions, has been studied extensively during recent years both theoretically  2  -  4  and experimentally  5  . It was shown  6  that this effect may play important role in various physical phenomena such as capillary condensation  7, 8  or wetting  9  .\nIn particular, the critical Casimir effect plays crucial role in the physics of thin liquid helium films  10  where it leads to the appearance of additional forces  11  responsible for the formation of stable droplets  12  . These effects have been observed recently  13  in experiments performed on helium nanodroplets trapped inside magnetic traps  14  . However, most theoretical studies so far were restricted to idealized situations neglecting the influence of the substrate  15  -  17  . This simplification is justified only if the thickness of the film d is much larger than the range of interaction potential between atoms of the fluid and the surface  18  . For example, in case of 4 He films adsorbed on graphite substrates  19  the typical values of these parameters are  20  : r 0 ≈ 3Å, d ≈ 10 − 100 nm. Therefore, taking into account the substrate explicitly is necessary  21  especially close to the wetting transition  22  .",

INTRODUCTORY REMARK The essential Casimir effect 1 , i . e . , the force acting between macroscopic bodies owing to fluctuations of the order parameter near their phase transitions , has been studied thoroughly during recent months both theoretically 2 - 4 and experimentally 5 .It was shown 6 that this effect could play crucial role in different mechanical phenomena such as capillary condensation 7 , 8 or wetting 9 . In particular , the critical Casimir effect serves crucial role in the physics of dense liquid helium films 10 where it gives to the emergence of added forces 11 contributing for the formation of stable droplets 12 .These effects have been observed recently 13 in experiments conducted on helium nanodroplets caught inside magnetic traps 14 . However , most theoretical researchers so far were restricted to idealized scenarios neglecting the impact of the substrate 15 - 17 .This simplification is justified only if the length of the film d is much larger than the range of interaction potential between molecules of the liquid and the surface 18 . For instance , in case of 4 He films adsorbed on graphite substrates 19 the typical values of these parameters are 20 : l 0 ≈ 3Å , d ≈ 10 − 100 nm .Therefore , giving into consideration the substrate explicitly is required 21 especially close to the wetting transition 22 .",

We find that there is no correlation between the total luminosity or effective temperature of these objects and their mass-loss rates. The observed scatter may be explained by differences in chemical composition and/or pulsation properties among individual sources. In addition to this we show that the dust-to-gas ratio decreases towards higher temperatures for oxygen-rich as well as carbon-rich AGB stars. This indicates that the physical conditions at which dust forms are different in both types of evolved stars. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to improve current models describing the evolution of red giants. Keywords: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars; Dust formation; Red Giants; Mass loss. 1 Introduction Carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter Crich AGB) stars have been studied extensively over the past decades because they represent an important source class of interstellar matter. They lose large amounts of material through stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the outflowing gas. These winds play an essential role in shaping circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars and thus influence the appearance of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. However, despite numerous observational studies it remains unclear what determines the amount of mass lost by Crich AGB stars.

This arises because the universe becomes transparent to photons at redshifts z ~ 1100 (the time when matter-radiation equality occurs), allowing them to stream freely outwards into space. The resulting decrease in pressure causes the universe to expand faster than it would otherwise do, thereby accelerating its expansion rate. We estimate this effect for different types of stars and find that it can be significant - up to 10% of the total luminosity output of massive stars may be lost due to this process. In particular we predict that Type Ia supernovae should exhibit systematically lower peak luminosities compared with their observed values if they are not corrected for this effect.

To increase their performance , nonlinear multiuser detectors such as consecutive interference cancellation 9 or parallel interference cancellation 10 were introduced .These detectors need accurate knowledge about the received messages 11 . Therefore , blind multiuser detectors 12 - 14 were developed to estimate unknown parameters without any testing sequence 15 .Although blind multiuser detectors do not require prior information about the received signal , they generally work worse than conventional multiuser detectors 16 . Recently , there has been growing interest in building multiuser detectors for time - differing channels 17 - 20 .Since the channel varies over time , it becomes more impossible to locate the transmitted expression accurately 21 . Moreover , if the channel shifts rapidly , then the sensor may fail entirely 22 .Thus , it is important to build robust multiuser detectors against sudden channel variations 23 .",

Hw I .INTRODUCTORY REMARK The static potential plays an important role in understanding nonperturbative processes such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) . It has been studied thoroughly both theoretically 1 - 4 and experimentally 5 , but its precise measurement still remains challenging 6 .In particular , it would be interesting to examine how the static potential shifts when going beyond the standard two - flavor case 7 , 8 . This can be performed either by exploring more flavors 9 or by examining theories with various gauge fields 10 .Here we will investigate the latter option and focus on the SU ( 3 ) color band which belongs to three active flavors 11 .",

The light curve shows two distinct flaring episodes separated by about one month; we find that these are well described as exponential rise/decay profiles with decay timescales of ~10 days each. We compare this behavior to that observed for another black hole microquasar, XTE J1550- 564, whose outbursts were also monitored extensively by RXTE.

The resulting field equations have solutions comparable to those generated from Einstein s field equations .However , unlike Einstein s field equations , our proposed field equations do not include any free parameters such as cosmological factor or black material . This implies that all physical phenomena predicted by these two explanations should agree precisely if they are based on the same underlying principles .Finally , we talk some possible experimental tests of our proposal . The conventional hypothesis is the most succesful model in particle theory , however it fails to explain gravity .In this article we present another methodology that unifies general relavity with quantum mechanics by offering a new notion called “ quantum potental energy density ” ( QPD ) . Quantum potential electricity density has been proposed earlier by various literature 1 - 5 , but its significance was confined only to describing particular aspects of quantum mechanics like uncertainty relations 6 , tunneling effect 7 - 9 , wave - particle duality 10 - 12 etc . .Here we develop a new definition of QPD where it takes a central role in deriving gravitational field equations . These field equations are then constructed from Hamilton ’ s principle of least action .Our results propose that QPD would play a basic part in understanding both gravity and quantum mechanics at their deepest level .",

        "original_text": "The present work is devoted to the study of astrophysical plasma turbulence, with particular emphasis on its statistical properties at different scales. We consider both kinetic and fluid descriptions for the dynamics of collisionless plasmas, which are relevant for many space and laboratory applications. In this context we investigate the nonlinear evolution of magnetic fluctuations by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The main results can be summarized as follows:  1. Turbulence statistics -We perform DNSs of the Vlasov-Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical properties of the electrostatic potential fluctuations generated by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes. Our analysis shows that the energy cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it reaches the ion Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping. At these small scales, the energy transfer rate decreases due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors. This process leads to the formation of intermittency in the distribution function of particles.  2. Kinetic effects -In addition to the above mentioned features observed in the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results show that kinetic effects play also an important role in determining the statistical properties of the fluctuating fields. Indeed, we find that the presence of ions modifies significantly the shape of the probability density functions (PDFs), leading to non-Gaussian distributions characterized by tails extending over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we observe that the PDFs become more skewed when increasing the value of the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

The main results can be summarized as follows : 1 .Turbulence statistics - We perform DNSs of the Vlasov - Poisson system in order to characterize the statistical characteristics of the electrostatic potential fluctuations formed by an initial spectrum of Alfvenic modes . Our study shows that the power cascade proceeds towards smaller spatial scales until it meets the electron Larmor radius scale where it is transferred into perpendicular wavenumbers through Landau damping .At these little scales , the power transfer frequency falls due to the reduction of phase correlations between wavevectors .

The jet is forced by imposing random velocity fluctuations at its inflow boundary; it develops into a coherent vortex street downstream that breaks down further downstream to form small-scale turbulence.

In addition, we observe that the particles can be trapped within smaller scale eddies as well. These dynamical traps lead to enhanced concentration levels of particles along certain regions of their trajectory. Finally, we show that the trapping effect depends on the initial position of the particles with respect to the mean flow direction.

The HHG process can be understood as a sequence of three steps: First, electrons are ionized by strong laser fields. Second, they propagate through the continuum until rescattering with parent ions occurs. Third, these returning electrons emit high harmonics when interacting again with the driving field. We show that this picture leads to a simple expression for the emitted harmonic intensity, which depends only on two parameters characterizing the molecule s orbital structure. This result allows us to explain the observed interference patterns between different harmonics in terms of destructive or constructive interferences between contributions from different molecular orbits. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to predict the emission properties of new types of molecules. High-order harmonic generation (HHG), i.e., the coherent emission of photons at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of intense femtosecond laser pulses, has attracted considerable interest over recent years  1, 2  .

Second, we apply the so-called  heterolevel  approximation within restricted Hartree-Fock theory and second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. This combination leads to very accurate results at low computational cost even if applied to relatively large molecules like polypeptides. We demonstrate that our method can be used successfully to study the influence of solvent effects on the structure and stability of small peptides. Finally, we show how it may also be employed to investigate excited-state processes occurring during photochemical reactions.",

A common feature of these systems is their tendency towards ordering: At high temperatures they usually exhibit liquid-like behavior while below some critical temperature T c , they freeze into solid structures. This freezing process is accompanied by a discontinuous change of thermodynamic quantities (e.g., specific heat) signaling a first-order phase transition  2  .\n \nIn this work we consider disordered systems consisting of N interacting particles confined to a volume V .

This freezing process is preceded by a discontinuous change of thermodynamic quantities ( e . g . , basic heat ) signaling a first - order phase change 2 .In this research we study disordered systems composed of N interacting interactions enclosed to a volume V . These particles may have different shapes and / or charges leading to a distribution of coupling energies between them .As a result , even if the scheme has only one sort of particles it will react differently than a monodisperse scheme 3 . If the length of the size / charge distribution gets too huge , however , the scheme drops its capacity to form ordered phases entirely 4 .It then behaves more like a gas instead than a liquid 5 . Here we investigate how the presence of polydispersity affects the nature of the disordering transitions observed in these systems .To do so , we perform Monte Carlo simulations using a theory introduced by Kob and Andersen 6 . Our main discovery is that , for sufficiently high values of the polydisperisty index , there exists no phase shift at all but rather a periodic drop of entropy upon decreasing temperature .On the other hand , for low enough polydispers",

One promising technique involves measuring the radio-frequency (RF) emission produced when UHE particles interact with molecules in the upper atmosphere  2  , which can be detected remotely over large areas  3  .\n \nThe most prominent feature of this RF emission is an intense broadband pulse lasting several microseconds  4  .

Keywords : Cosmic rays , Radio beams , Air showers , Coherence , Synchrotron emission 1 Introduction In recent years there has been growing interest in establishing novel techniques for detecting ultra - large - energy ( UHE ) cosmic rays based upon their association with Earth s atmosphere 1 .One promising hypothesis includes monitoring the television - frequency ( RF ) emission generated when UHE ions contact with compounds in the higher atmosphere 2 , which can be identified remotely over large areas 3 . The most notable feature of this RF absorption is an intense broadband wave lasting several microseconds 4 .This wave exists because the charged particle cascade generated by each main cosmic ray interacts heavily with the geomagnetic field , forcing it to emit coherently across a broad variety of rates 5 . However , other mechanisms may contribute greatly to the total RF radiation 6 .Here we present observations made with the Low - Frequency Array ( LOFAR ) , one element of the International LOFAR Telescope 7 .

We find that this process leads to rapid growth of the largest embryo until it reaches its isolation mass (the minimum mass required for runaway accretion). The system then evolves into either a single planet or two planets with comparable masses depending on how close the initial conditions were to instability. This evolution is very different than what happens when all bodies grow simultaneously; in particular, we show that there can be multiple stable outcomes even if the initial conditions are identical. Our results suggest that the formation of terrestrial planets may have proceeded through several stages including oligarchy before reaching their final state as observed today. In addition, our work provides new insights about the origin of Mercury-like planets. Protoplanetary embryos form in circumstellar disks around young stars and undergo mutual gravitational interactions during their growth phase. These interactions lead to orbital migration and dynamical instabilities such as collisions between neighboring embryos. If these processes occur frequently enough, only one body will survive at the end of the growth stage leaving behind a planetary system consisting of just one planet. However, recent studies indicate that many planetary systems contain more than one planet suggesting that some mechanism must exist to prevent complete destruction of the system. Here we study the possibility that protoplanetary embryos follow a hierarchical evolutionary path where they first grow hierarchically via gravitational scattering followed by runaway accretion once the largest embryo has reached its isolation mass. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scenario naturally explains the existence of multi-planet systems while also reproducing the properties of known exoplanets.",

These include temperature increases up to several million degrees Kelvin, strong magnetic fields, high densities, and large velocities. All these factors affect the shape of spectral lines emitted by different atmospheric layers.

Also, the presence of nonthermal electrons causes significant deviations from Maxwellian velocity distributions leading to asymmetric line profiles (e.g., Canfield et al. (1990) ; Doschek et al.

The proposed approach is based on the concept that all users should be allocated their required data rates at minimum total transmit power consumption while maintaining acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). We first develop a new analytical model which can accurately predict the average received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under different system configurations. Based on our analysis results, we then formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem subject to SINR constraints. Finally, by applying Lagrange multiplier method, we obtain closed-form solutions for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Our simulation results show that compared with conventional schemes such as water-filling algorithm, the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains in terms of power efficiency without sacrificing QoS requirements.

Since then various theoretical approaches have been developed to solve it  7 -10  . Among these approaches, the most successful one is probably the so-called HolsteinPrimakoff transformation  11  which maps the original problem into a spin-1/2 system  12  . This approach works very well at weak-coupling regime where the interaction between atom-field is relatively small. However, it fails completely at large-coupling limit since the mapping procedure breaks down due to the appearance of unphysical states  13  .

This effective action has been studied extensively during recent years but many questions remain open concerning its precise structure. One particular issue concerns the question whether this action is gauge invariant.

Finally, we discuss how our results are related to recent experiments on GaAs quantum wells. The effect of the Luttinger terms, structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), and Zeeman splitting on resonant spin polarization (RS P ) has been studied using density functional theory.

        "original_text": "We study the entanglement properties of two qubits coupled by an antisymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction (AAEI) in a magnetic chain described by the Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We show that for certain values of the parameters, this system can be mapped onto a spin-1/2 XYZ chain and we calculate analytically its concurrence as well as the von Neumann entropy. The results are compared to those obtained numerically using exact diagonalization techniques. In particular, it is shown that the AAEI leads to a significant increase of the concurrence between nearest-neighboring spins when compared to the standard XXZ case. Moreover, we find that there exists a critical value of the anisotropy parameter beyond which no entanglement survives. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be tested experimentally. Introduction:-Entangled states play a crucial role in quantum information processing  1  . Therefore, understanding their generation mechanisms has been one of the main goals of many theoretical investigations  2  -  4  .\nIn recent years, much attention was paid to the investigation of entanglement in various types of spin chains  5  , including the so-called XXZ chain  6 -  8  . However, most studies were focused only on the ground state  9  or low lying excited states  10  of these systems. On the other hand, recently developed experimental techniques allow us to prepare highly excited states  11  .

The proposed method is based on the idea of using multiple views, each one capturing different aspects or features of the same dataset. We show how this can be achieved by defining a set of views for each node in the decision tree model being learned. These views are then used as input to a modified version of the standard ID3 algorithm which learns the decision tree structure. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and execution time when compared against existing approaches. Decision trees have been widely applied in many areas such as classification, regression analysis, clustering, association rule mining, etc., due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) high computational cost; and (2) poor scalability. In particular, the number of possible splits at any given internal node grows exponentially with respect to the size of its parent s training sample. This makes it difficult to build large decision trees efficiently. To address these problems we propose a novel approach called Relational Views-based Decision Tree Learning (RV-DTL). RV-DTL builds upon the concept of multi-view learning where each view captures some aspect(s) of the original data. More specifically, our approach defines a set of views for every internal node in the decision tree being built. Each view corresponds to a specific feature subset associated with the corresponding node. Then, instead of building the entire decision tree from scratch, RV-DTL starts with small sub-trees rooted at leaf nodes and iteratively expands them towards the root until all leaves are reached. At each expansion step, RV-DTL selects the best split among those available according to the information gain criterion. Finally, the final decision tree is constructed by merging together...",

These views are then used as input to a altered version of the standard ID3 algorithm which understands the reasoning tree structure .Our research results show considerable improvements in terms of both precision and execution time when compared against existing techniques . Decision trees have been widely applied in different areas such as classification , regression evaluation , clustering , association rule extraction , etc . , owing to their simplicity and effectiveness .However , they suffer from two principal drawbacks : ( 1 ) great computational cost ; and ( 2 ) poor scalability . In particular , the number of possible splits at any certain internal node grows exponentially with regard to the length of its parent s training sample .This creates it difficult to build large decision forests quickly . To address these problems we propose a new approach titled Relational Views - based Decision Tree Learning ( RV - DTL ) .RV - DTL relies upon the idea of multi - view testing where each vision preserves some aspect ( s ) of the original material . More specifically , our approach establishes a setting of views for every internal node in the decision tree being built .Each view belongs to a certain characteristic subset associated with the respective node . Then , rather of building the entire choice tree from scratch , RV - DTL began with little sub - forests rooted at leaf nodes and iteratively builds them towards the root until all leaves are reached .At each expansion stage , RV - DTL selects the best split among those available based to the information gain criterion . Finally , the finished choice table is built by merging together . . .",

These finds feature the observation of rapid increase of complete cross sections 3 , dip - bump formation 4 , backwards - backward asymmetry 5 , etc . .It should be mentioned however that several important questions remain open concerning the nature of the fundamental interactions involved for all these influences 6 . In particular , it remains unsure whether they can be described within the standard Regge principle 7 , 8 or use more complicated approaches like those concerning unitarization 9 and / or saturation 10 mechanisms .Another important dispute concerns the importance played by higher - order corrections in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics ( QCD ) . Indeed , while the led order BFKL 11 and DGLAP 12 equations offer reasonable explanation of theoretical data 13 , their next - to - leading order additions 14 , 15 lead to significant deviations 16 which would indicate the necessity for resummation methods 17 .2 Data Analysis To shed some light on these problems we have done thorough study of available data on elastic scattering systems collected lately by two dedicated studies - the TOTEM 18 and UA7 19 collaborations .

In both cases we find that there are regimes where the system can be driven into highly entangled states even when it starts out unentangled or only weakly entangled. This occurs because the environment acts as a source of noise which drives the system towards its ground state.

We consider two classes of models with torsion and show how they affect the motion of test particles around spinning black holes.

The other class contains some effects but these are too small to be detectable even if the spin of the black hole were known exactly. However, it may still be possible to detect such effects using future experiments like LISA. Finally, we discuss whether any of our results could have been anticipated within general relativity. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. Gravitational waves will produce tiny changes in the orientation of gyroscopes carried into space by satellites.

Most of these works concentrate on studying the dynamics of the magnetization under external electric field 22 , 23 .Very minimal focus has been paid to the effects of the spin current itself on the switching behaviors 24 .",

The new formulation allows us to calculate the deflection of the shell at any point on its surface without having to solve additional equations or perform numerical integration.

The presence of these features leads to higher levels of productivity and population density, which further increase the benefits associated with specialization and trade. Our results suggest that the emergence of such socioeconomic structures may have been one important factor driving the evolution of human society over the past few million years.

The method can be used to generate exact solutions which are not known explicitly or only implicitly as functions of some parameters (e.g., by solving algebraic equations). We illustrate our approach on several examples including Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter black holes, Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, and charged dilatonic black holes. In particular we show how one can obtain explicit expressions for the massless limit of these black hole solutions.

For example, it took more than 100 years after the discovery of general relativity before the first exact black hole solutions were found  1-3 .

The proposed approach involves coupling two existing models; one that describes the movement of molecules through the cytoplasm (the fluid part of the cell) using Brownian dynamics simulations, with another which represents the nucleus as a porous medium containing immobile obstacles.  This latter component has been developed by considering the geometry of the nuclear pore complex network, which consists of cylindrical pores connected via narrower channels.   In order to validate our new hybrid model we have performed a series of numerical experiments on synthetic data generated from both individual particle tracking and Monte Carlo methods.  We find good agreement between these results and those obtained from our own computational scheme, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Finally, we apply our new modelling framework to investigate how changes in the structure of the nuclear pore complexes can affect the rate of molecular exchange across the nuclear envelope.",

In order to identify the kind of each tube individually , various experimental methods have been used 6 - 8 .For instance , Raman scattering 9 or photoluminescence 10 measurements enable one to distinguish between metallic and semiconducting tubes based on the frequency proportion of certain peaks 11 . Alternatively , electrical travel test 12 provide details about the charge carrier density and connectivity 13 .Finally , transmission electron microscopy 14 allows one to fully visualize the formation of the tubes 15 . Here we present another technique for determining the chirality of different carbon nanotubes .Our model relies on measuring the absorption cross section of individual SWNTs 16 . Since the absorption cross - section depends on the dielectric function 17 , which in turn varies dramatically based on whether the pipe is metallic or semiconducting 18 , we expect different values for the absorption cross sections of metallic versus semiconducting tubes .By matching the measured absorbed cross sections of different tubes , we will show how this methodology can be used to classify them into either metallic or semiconducting grades .

The interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), which are both parent compounds for high temperature superconductivity, is found to be highly conducting despite the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and YBCO. This suggests that charge transfer across the interface occurs due to strong electronic hybridization rather than strain relaxation alone. We also find that the hole concentration in the YBCO layer can be controlled by varying the thickness of the LSMO layer grown on top of it. These results demonstrate an alternative approach towards engineering the carrier density in cuprate superconductors using oxide heterostructures. High-temperature superconductivity has been observed only in materials containing copper-oxygen planes known as CuO2 layers  1  . In these systems, holes doped into the CuO2 plane give rise to Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity  2  . However, the maximum critical temperature Tc = 92 K achieved so far in this class of materials is still well below the theoretical limit predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory  3  , raising questions about how to further enhance Tc  4  .\nIn recent years there have been significant efforts made to explore new routes toward enhancing Tc beyond its current record value  5  . One promising route involves introducing electrons into the CuO2 plane  6  . For example, replacing oxygen atoms in the CuO2 plane with fluorine leads to a reduction in the number of holes in the system  7, 8  . Alternatively, one may introduce electrons directly into the CuO2 plane by growing thin films of transition metal oxides such as SrTiO3  9  or LaAlO3  10  onto the surface of cuprate superconductors.

These results suggest that the observed scatter in the Tully-Fischer relation may be due primarily to variations in SB among galaxies of similar luminosities rather than differences in their masses.

        "original_text": "The information-based asset pricing model is an extension to the traditional CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) that incorporates additional factors into its analysis.  The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.   The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.   The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.    This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.  It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.  In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.  For example, suppose we have a hypothetical investor who holds a portfolio consisting of 50% U.S. Treasury bills and 50% Standard & Poor’s 500 Index Funds.

The first factor , market risk premium , represents the additional return investors need for holding risky funds over and above their returns on small - risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds .The second factor , size factor , reflects variations in expected returns between small - cap stocks and large - cap stocks . The third factor , value effect , represents the difference in returns between strong book - to - market ratio stocks and low book - to - market ratio stocks ; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling .This page offers a brief overview of these three variables along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions . The Capital Assets Pricing Model ( CAPM ) , developed by Sharpe ( 1964 ) , Lintner ( 1965 ) , Mossin ( 1966 ) , and Black ( 1972 ) , is one of the most commonly used theories in finance today .It says that the expected rate of return on any certain security should equivalent the sum of two parts - the danger - free level plus a risk premium associated with the degree of systematic risk inherent in each security . In other words , if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk - safe securities then your anticipated return will simply be the risk - safe level ; however , if you hold a diversified portfolio encompassing both risky and non - risky securities then your anticipated level of return will expand proportionately with the quantity of risk you took on .For instance , suppose we have a hypothetical buyer who holds a portfolio consisting of 50 % U .

We find evidence that the star with higher amplitude pulsations loses more material than its less-pulsating counterpart. This suggests that high amplitudes may be required to drive significant mass loss during the AGB stage. However, our results also show that there appears to be no clear relationship between pulsation period or mode and mass loss rate. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of low-metallicity stars as well as the formation of planetary nebulae.",

This process proceeds until the branes separate again and the universe reverts back to its previous size .As well as explaining some latest findings obtained using these tactics , I will also describe some open problems involved with them . Finally , I will briefly include another methodology to creating accurate theories of inflation centered upon so - called brane - world scenarios .",

The observations were carried out in the period between September 2005 and December 2007 using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. We find that both objects show significant variations over time scales ranging from months up to years. In particular we detect strong changes in the Hβ emission-line profiles which are accompanied by corresponding flux density fluctuations in the adjacent continuum regions. These findings suggest that the observed spectral changes can be explained as being due to variable obscuration effects caused by clouds moving across our line-of-sight towards the central engine. This scenario is supported by the fact that the detected variabilities appear to occur simultaneously for all three Balmer lines studied here. Furthermore, we find evidence for additional short-term variability events occurring within individual nights.",

We find that this method will not work with current technology because it requires very accurate measurements of pulse arrival times over many years. However, we show how future radio telescopes could make such measurements if they are equipped with new technologies like phased-array feeds or digital backends. In addition, we discuss other possible methods using pulsar timing data to search for gravitational waves. Gravitational waves cause time delays between pulses emitted at different points on the surface of a rotating neutron star. These time delays depend on the distance between these points as well as their position relative to the line-of-sight towards the observer. The most prominent effects occur when the wave passes close to the Earth and its companion stars. This causes an additional delay known as the Shapiro effect  Shapiro 1964  . If one knows the positions of all pulsars within a globular cluster, then one can use the observed pulse arrival times to measure the distances between them.

We find that this sunspot is composed of several magnetic flux tubes with different orientations. In addition to these features we also observe an extended bright feature located between the main sunspot umbrae. This feature has been previously reported as a penumbral filament but our data show no evidence of such structure. Instead, we interpret this feature as a coronal rain blob. The second sunspot was observed for only 1 hour before being occulted by Earths atmosphere. During this observation period the sunspot rotated by less than 30 degrees. Our analysis shows that both sunspots are surrounded by a dark lane which may be associated with the moat surrounding large sunspots.",

The sample consists of 29 elliptical galaxies within 40 Mpc distance. Our main result is that we find no significant difference between the black hole masses derived by both methods. This indicates that there exists a tight relationship between the black hole mass and the total luminosity of its host galaxy.

We consider two models : ( i ) The first theory requires that all transmitters have fixed power rates .( ii ) In the second theory we suppose that transmitters can adjust their powers dynamically . For both cases , we show how to find an appropriate schedule by solving a sequence of linear programs .Our results hold even if there exists only one receiver per transmitter .

We find that, for typical parameters relevant to high-power laser-plasma experiments, SBS is dominated by electrostatic Langmuir wave instabilities rather than ion-acoustic modes. The latter are suppressed due to Landau damping as well as mode conversion into electromagnetic radiation at oblique angles with respect to the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that the effect of ion trapping can be neglected if the density fluctuations associated with the trapped ions are small compared to those caused by the electrons. Finally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of ion trapping does not significantly affect the growth rates or saturation levels of the dominant electrostatic Langmuir waves. This finding suggests that the observed discrepancies between theory predictions and experimental results may originate from other effects such as nonlocality and/or nonlinear coupling among different types of waves.",

The new data reveal extended emission around both TeV sources which is not detected by previous surveys. We discuss possible scenarios for this emission based on our results as well as those obtained recently by other authors. In particular we propose that the observed structures are due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in shocks driven by stellar winds interacting within these clusters. This scenario would also explain why no X-ray counterparts have been found so far despite deep searches carried out with Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Finally, we estimate the magnetic field strength required to produce such emission using standard models for particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries. \nIntroduction\n\nThe Cygnus OB2 association contains more than 100 OB stars distributed over an area of about 50 square degrees centered at l = 80°and b = 1° (  Fig.   1a ). It has been suggested that many of them could be members of binary systems or even multiple systems (e.g., Knödlseder 2000; Wright et al. 2010) . These objects can drive powerful winds into their surroundings creating strong shocks where particles may be accelerated up to very high energies. If some of these particles escape from the shock fronts they will interact with photons coming from the surrounding interstellar medium producing high-energy electromagnetic radiation detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV range. \n \n Several studies suggest that several of the known TeV sources in the sky might be related to young open clusters like Cyg OB2 (see e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005a ,b, 2007a .

If some of these ions survive from the shock fronts they will interact with photons coming from the nearby interstellar medium generating high - energy electromagnetic radiation detectable across most of the electromagnetic spectrum including the TeV range .Several studies propose that several of the known TeV sources in the heavens would be connected to early open complexes like Cyg OB2 ( see e . g . , Aharonian et al . 2005a , b , 2007a .However , only few of these associations have been confirmed through multi - wavelength campaigns involving optical / microwave imaging , spectroscopy and / or radio continuum observations ( saw e . g . , Reimer & Böttcher 2006 , Castro - Tirado et al",

However , despite many theoretical proposals 9 , there have so far been very few successful proposals to experimentally prove spintronic systems based on graphene 10 .One reason could be the difficulty to find adequate devices with adequate strong spinning - orbit interaction 11 .

INTRODUCTORY REMARkS\nThe study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms  1  . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see  2  -  4  for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one  5  .\nIn this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves  6  .

Other more sophisticated ways include assigning multiple weights based to the confidence rate of each classifier 9 ; however , finding ideal values for those variables requires added effort 10 .Recently , researchers have started researching new ways to automatically generate ensembles without using prior information 11 . One of them requires merging genetic methods 12 and bagging 13 .These two procedures were first applied separately 14 , 15 , but later they were integrated together 16 .",

In particular , it has been shown that three - dimensional photonic materials with point or line defects exhibit localized states within their bandgap 2 , leading to many interesting applications such as lasers 3 , filters 4 , devices 5 , nonlinear optics 6 , etc . .However , fabrication of three - dimensional photonic particles needs specialized techniques 7 , 8 , making them harder to integrate with other micro / nano - materials . Recently , various groups have demonstrated two - dimensional photonic particles 9 - 11 fabricated fully inside transparent materials via continuous optical writing 12 - 14 .These 2D photonic materials provide advantages including ease of fabrication , simplicity in design , and compatibility with existing devices 15 . In this Letter we prove the formation of defect modes in opticallyinduced photonic materials ( OPC ) 16 .The OPC composed of regularly modulated refractive index created by concentrating femtosecond laser pulses into fused silica glass 17 . By introducing defects into the lattice structure , we perceive localized failure modes within the stopband of the OPC .Furthermore , we find that the failure mode wavelength can be continuously tuned across the entire stopband solely by varying the crystal spacing and / or the size of the defects . The empirical setup used to create the OPC is depicted schematically in Fig .1 ( a ) .

        "original_text": "We consider the possibility that our universe is described by a brane world model with an arbitrary number of dimensions, but no reflection symmetry across any of them.  We show how to construct such models and discuss their phenomenological consequences for cosmology and particle physics. In particular we find that there are two classes of solutions which can be distinguished by whether or not they contain closed timelike curves (CTCs). The first class contains CTCs while the second does not. For both cases we calculate the effective four dimensional Planck mass as well as the masses of Kaluza-Klein excitations on the brane. Finally we study the stability properties of these solutions under small perturbations. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456728. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q; 11.25.-w; 98.80.Cq . \nI. INTRODU CTION\n\nThe idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions has been around since the early days of general relativity  1  , when it was realized that Einstein s field equations admit solutions with extra dimensions  2  .\nIn recent years this idea has received renewed interest due to developments in string theory  3  where it appears naturally  4  . String theoretic constructions typically involve compactification of higher-dimensional space-times down to lower ones  5  -  8  . However, even if one starts out with a ten-or eleven-dimensional background solution, the resulting low energy description will generically include additional fields living in the bulk  9  -  11  . These fields couple to matter localized on the branes  12  giving rise to new effects at low energies  13  -  16  .\nOne particularly interesting feature of many braneworld scenarios  17  -  20  is the presence of time-like singularities  21  -  23  .

INTRODU CTION The idea that our universe might have more than three spatial dimensions has been around since the early days of general relativity 1 , when it was understood that Einstein s field equations admit answers with extra dimensions 2 . In recent seasons this idea has garnered renewed enthusiasm due to developments in string theory 3 where it appears naturally 4 .String theoretic constructions often include compactification of greater - dimensional space - times down to smaller ones 5 - 8 . However , even if one starts out with a ten - or twelve - dimensional background solution , the resulting lowest energy representation will generically contain extra fields lived in the bulk 9 - 11 .These fields pair to matter localized on the branes 12 providing rise to new effects at low frequencies 13 - 16 . One especially interesting feature of several braneworld situations 17 - 20 is the formation of time - like singularities 21 - 23 .Such singularities arise whenever the volume of some internal dimension shrinks to zero size 24 . They lead to problems with causality 25 unless the resulting period coordinate is identified periodically 26 .If this identity is accomplished in a way consistent with supersymmetry then the singularities disappear 27 .

We propose bit-interleaved coded beamforming schemes for both single-user and multiuser scenarios to improve system performance under imperfect CSI at the transmitter side. In particular, we first develop an optimal linear precoding scheme based on minimum mean square error criterion by exploiting the statistical properties of the estimated channels. Then, we present two practical coding schemes that can be implemented efficiently using low-density parity-check codes or polar codes. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes over existing ones. The main contributions of this thesis include:  1) Optimal Linear Precoding Scheme: We derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity achieved by the optimal linear precoder when the number of transmit antennas goes to infinity.  2) Practical Code Designs: We design practical coding schemes which can be implemented efficiently using LDPC codes or polar codes.  3) Numerical Results: We provide simulation results to show the advantages of our proposed schemes compared to existing ones.",

        "original_text": "We present the results of three-dimensional MHD simulations that show how magnetic fields can be amplified by shocks in molecular clouds, and lead to the formation of dense filaments with high mass-to-flux ratios. The initial conditions are based on observations of nearby star-forming regions. We find that shock compression leads to an increase in density and temperature at the post-shock region. This causes the gas pressure gradient across the shock front to decrease rapidly as time progresses. As a result, the field lines become more tangled due to turbulent motions induced by the shock wave. In addition, we observe that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic energy through Alfvén waves generated behind the shock fronts. Finally, we demonstrate that these processes cause the magnetic flux-to-mass ratio to increase significantly within the shocked region. \n \n Keywords: Magnetic fields, Shocks, Star formation, Turbulence \n \n 1. Introduction \n \n Molecular clouds play important roles in star formation (SF) because they provide the material for stars to form out of. However, it remains unclear what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds. One possible mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds (Mac Low & Klessen 2004). Another possibility is that large-scale gravitational collapse may trigger localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars (Larson 1978; Bonnell et al. 1997) . It has been suggested that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during different stages of evolution of molecular clouds (Krumholz 2014). \n \n Recent observational studies have shown that many young massive stars are associated with filamentary structures observed in infrared dust emission maps (André et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2013 ). These filaments often appear to be aligned along magnetic field directions inferred from polarisation measurements (Chapman et al. 2011) , suggesting that magnetic fields might play an important role in regulating the dynamics of such systems. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields can affect the stability properties of self-gravitating clouds against global collapse (Mouschovias 1976; Tomis",

In addition , we determine that the magnetic energy is transferred into kinetic power through Alfvén currents produced behind the shock fronts .Finally , we prove that these mechanisms create the magnetic flux - to - mass ratio to expand significantly within the shocked region . Keywords : Magnetic fields , Shocks , Star formation , Turbulence 1 .Introduction Molecular clouds play crucial roles in star formation ( SF ) because they provide the material for stars to form out of . However , it remains unsure what physical mechanisms drive SF inside molecular clouds .One potential mechanism involves supersonic turbulence driven by supernovae explosions or stellar winds ( Mac Low & Klessen 2004 ) . Another possibility is that high - scale gravitational failure may generate localised fragmentation leading to the formation of dense cores which then evolve into protostars ( Larson 1978 ; Bonnell et al .1997 ) . It has been proposed that both scenarios could operate simultaneously during various phases of evolved of molecular clouds ( Krumholz 2014 ) .Recent observational investigations have shown that several young massive stars are related with filamentary structures discovered in infrared dust emission images ( André et al . 2010 ; Peretto et al .2013 ) . These filaments often seem to be aligned along magnetic force directions inferred from polarisation observations ( Chapman et al .2011 ) , showing that magnetic waves might play an important role in controlling the dynamics of such systems . Indeed , theoretical theories indicate that magnetic waves can affect the stability properties of self - gravitating clouds against global failure ( Mouschovias 1976 ; Tomis",

The QD emission line splits into two components with opposite circular polarization when the magnetic field is increased to about 1 T, which corresponds to the Zeeman splitting energy of 0.5 meV at 4 K. We observe that this splitting increases linearly as temperature decreases down to 20 mK and then saturates below 10 mK. This behavior can be explained by taking into account both electron-hole exchange interaction and phonon-assisted relaxation processes between different excitonic states within QDs. Our results show that the spin-flip time for electrons confined inside QDs is longer than 100 ns even under high magnetic fields up to 5 T. Quantum dot (QD), also known as semiconductor nanocrystal or artificial atom, has attracted much attention due to its unique physical properties such as size-tunable band gap  1  , strong confinement effect  2  , and large oscillator strength  3  . These features make it possible to use QDs as building blocks for various optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes  4  , lasers  5  , solar cells  6  , photodetectors  7  , and so forth  8  .\nIn recent years, there have been many efforts devoted to investigating the spin dynamics of carriers confined in QDs  9  -  11  .

We find that there are two distinct modes of solar magnetic field evolution over this period. One mode shows strong fluctuations around a mean value which varies slowly but significantly during the cycle 23/24 minimum. This behaviour can be explained as being due to the presence of large-scale dynamo waves driven by differential rotation. In addition we identify another type of variation which appears to have no preferred frequency or spatial scale.

The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches.

We find that, in agreement with previous studies, evaporation causes GCs to lose stars preferentially on their low-mass end and thus steepens the MF slope towards lower masses. However, we show that this effect is counteracted by two competing processes: dynamical friction which removes massive stars more efficiently than less massive ones; and relaxation-driven core collapse which increases the central density of the cluster and makes it harder for massive stars to escape. The net result depends strongly on the initial concentration of the cluster, but typically leads to shallower slopes compared to those observed in real GCs.

This research has been funded by the European Commission through the Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) program. The concept of tensegrity was first introduced by Buckminster Fuller more than 60 years ago  1  . It describes the structural behavior of many natural systems like muscles  2  , tendons  3  , bones  4  , and even living organisms  5  .\nIn recent decades there have been several attempts at applying the concept of tensegrity to engineering applications  6  -  8  . However, most of these works focus on discrete tensegrities which consist of rigid bars connected together by elastic struts  9  . These types of structures cannot easily adapt to changes in their environment since they do not allow for any deformation  10  . On the other hand, continuous tensegrities  11  are capable of changing shape continuously when subjected to external forces  12  . They also exhibit higher levels of robustness against damage  13  compared to conventional materials  14  . Despite all these advantages, very little attention has been paid so far to the design of continuous tensegrities  15  .\nThis lack of interest may be due to the fact that designing continuous tensegrities requires solving highly nonlinear optimization problems  16  . Moreover, finding solutions to these problems is extremely challenging because of the high number of local optima  17  . To overcome these difficulties, researchers usually use heuristic search algorithms  18  -  20  instead of exact methods  21  .",

The data are consistent with theoretical predictions that such emissions should be produced by particles accelerated near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole located there.   This is the first time this phenomenon has been observed outside our own Galaxy and it opens up new opportunities for studying particle acceleration processes around black holes. Black holes are among the most exotic objects known to science. They have no surface or edge but instead exist as singularities where space-time ends.

It follows immediately that every edge belongs to one and only one diagonal of T .\nIn  3  , Motzkin and Straus  celebrated theorem states that if D denotes the set of diagonals of a convex polygon Q then |D| = 2|Q|. They also proved that the number of diagonalizations d(P ) of a convex polygon P equals the number of diagonals of a triangulation of P . \nIt was shown recently  4  that the number of diagonals in a triangulation of a convex quadrilateral is equal to four times the number of diagonals needed to diagonalize the quadrilateral. Thus, the following question arises naturally: What is the relationship between the number of diagonals required to diagonalize a convex quadrilateral and the number of diagonals used in a triangulation?",

We use these observations to determine ages, masses, radii, and distances for each star in both clusters using isochrone fitting techniques. The resulting mass functions are then compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Our main conclusions are:  1. Both clusters have similar age distributions but different mass distributions.  2. The observed mass function slopes agree well with predictions made by standard IMF theory when we assume that all stars more massive than 8 Msun were destroyed during supernovae explosions.  3. There appears to be no significant difference between the number of low-mass stars found within the central regions of the clusters as opposed to their outer regions. 4. The total number of high-mass stars in the clusters agrees very well with the expected number based on our knowledge of the initial mass function.",

In this talk I will review our recent work on simulating primordial magnetic fields with different physical processes involved. The first part focuses on the generation of seed magnetic fields during inflation by quantum fluctuations. We show that these seeds can be amplified significantly after reheating due to the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the decaying inflaton perturbations. Then we discuss how these seeds evolve into large-scale coherent magnetic fields through various mechanisms including inverse cascade, dynamo action and turbulent pumping. Finally, we present some possible observational signatures for future detection.

We find that there exists a new type of 2SC phase where quarks are paired into diquark condensates with different colors but same flavor. This novel phase has been named as Larkin-Ovchinnikova-Fulde-Ferreell (LOFF) state because it was first proposed to describe superfluidity in nuclear systems. In this LOFF state, we show that the gap parameter for pairing between quarks with opposite momenta depends on their relative angle. The magnitude of the gap decreases rapidly when they move away from each other along the Fermi surface. As a result, the energy gap vanishes completely near the boundary of the Brillouin zone.",

We find that, for strong shocks with Mach number M = 10 - 100, only about 1% CRs can be accelerated to ultra-high energy (UHE). This is because most particles are scattered back upstream before they gain enough energy to cross the shock front again. The low efficiency of UHE particle production leads to an upper limit on the maximum proton energy as well as the total CR luminosity produced by such shocks. Our results suggest that the observed fluxes of UHE protons cannot be explained solely by diffusive shock acceleration mechanism operating at cosmological shocks.
